Unlike the classical setting, where the braiding symmetry is required to be invertible, distorted monoidal categories admit non-invertible binary distortions and unit distortions while preserving coherent tensorial reasoning. We show that these structures naturally assemble into a strict 2-category whose composition and interchange laws hold on the nose, not merely up to isomorphism. Beyond the abstract 2-monad justification, our contribution is a fully constructive and type-safe calculus that enables formal reasoning about non-invertible interchange. We provide explicit construction schemes for such distortions, including idempotent twists of classical braidings and graded unit distortions arising from characters on monoidal gradings. This framework extends the expressive power of monoidal categories to model irreversible, resource-sensitive, and direction-dependent processes --such as those in directed homotopy theory, categorical quantum mechanics, and non-symmetric operadic structures--while remaining amenable to mechanization and formal verification."}

The first main contribution of this work is the derivation of an inhomogeneous Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality adapted to the unbounded weight, which provides the necessary control over the nonlinear term in terms of Sobolev norms. Building on this inequality, we then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions and establish a sharp dichotomy: solutions with initial data below the ground state energy either exist globally in time or experience finite-time blow-up. A distinctive feature of our results is that the analysis of the unbounded inhomogeneous term requires the imposition of radial symmetry on the initial data, which allows us to exploit certain Strauss type Sobolev estimates that would not hold in the general non-radial case. This work complements previous studies on biharmonic Schrödinger equations with singular inhomogeneities, highlighting both the challenges and the new phenomena that arise when the nonlinearity is weighted by a growing up unbounded function, which broke the space translation invariance of the standard homogeneous associated equation."}

This research addresses this critical gap by developing a large-scale, calibrated agent-based model for supplier selection, complemented by a probabilistic heuristic for international shipments. Our approach integrates trade relationships between industry sectors, transportation costs, and supplier rating model adapted from existing literature. The model's core objective is to minimize the discrepancy between modeled and observed commodity flows while ensuring a close match to regional shipping distance distributions. Implemented and tested across four major U.S. metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles, the model demonstrates high fidelity in replicating observed freight patterns. Key findings reveal consistent alignment with national shipping distance trends and highlight significant spatial variations in commodity trade assignments and demand across the study regions. This behaviorally informed and transport-sensitive framework is designed to approximate real-world decision-making, providing a robust tool for policymakers and planners to evaluate targeted interventions, assess infrastructure investments, and enhance supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions."}

Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics.

Each iterative method is encoded by two coupled channels-drift and diffusion-whose algebraic curvature measures the deviation from ideal reversibility and determines the attainable order of accuracy. Flat connections correspond to methods whose updates commute up to higher order and thus achieve minimal numerical dissipation while preserving stability.\n  The formalism recovers classical gradient, proximal, and momentum schemes as first-order flat cases and extends naturally to stochastic, preconditioned, and adaptive algorithms through perturbations controlled by curvature order. Explicit gauge corrections yield higher-order variants with guaranteed energy monotonicity and noise stability. The associated determinantal and isomonodromic formulations yield exact nonasymptotic bounds and describe acceleration effects via Painlevé-type invariants and Stokes corrections."}

In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced.

A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms."}

There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $λ$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $λ\\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $λ=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $λ=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are \"almost regular,\" in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \\sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $Ω_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $λ$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 α^4)$ for all $λ$, where $α= d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $λ$."}

In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szegő operator of Gérard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed.

Working on the idèle class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--Pólya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $ζ(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow."}

Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks.

In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds."}

Using this reformulation, our approach takes advantage of massive parallelism across both scenarios and transitions, enabling the simultaneous evaluation of \\emph{over one million uncertainty realizations} in a single GPU pass -- a scale far beyond the reach of existing methods.

The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model. In our limited understanding, we believe that this kind of phenomenon cannot be explained by the Parisi approach."}

But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott channel.The transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal."}

On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI."}

There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $λ$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $λ\\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $λ=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $λ=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are \"almost regular,\" in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \\sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $Ω_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $λ$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 α^4)$ for all $λ$, where $α= d_2 / d_1$.

The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role.

Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions. This is the first example of rigidity in the study of maximally non-integrable distributions, outside of contact topology.\n  First, we find an infinite family of $(2n+1)$-tori in the standard fat $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, with the following two properties: (1) They all represent the same formal prelegendrian class, (2) but they are not prelegendrian isotopic because they are distinguished by pseudoholomorphic curve invariants of their Legendrian lift.\n  Secondly, we define the notion of prelegendrian stabilization in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$. This allows us to take an arbitrary prelegendrian and produce another one, in the same formal class, whose Legendrian lift is loose.\n  In order to prove these results we also develop the fundamentals of the theory of prelegendrians.

In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(τ^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible.

The scattering from the full-line lattice is expressed in terms of the scattering from the fragments of the whole lattice by developing a factorization formula for the corresponding transition matrices. In particular, the matrix-valued transmission and reflection coefficients for the full-line lattice are explicitly expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for the left and right lattice fragments. Since the matrix-valued scattering coefficients are easier to determine for the fragments than for the full-line lattice, the factorization formula presented provides a method to determine the scattering coefficients for full-line lattices. The theory presented is illustrated with various explicit examples, including an example demonstrating that the matrix-valued left transmission coefficient in general is not equal to the matrix-valued right transmission coefficient for a lattice."}

Dykstra's algorithm is an iterative scheme for computing the Euclidean projection of an initial point onto the intersection of convex sets by successively projecting onto each set. Its low per-iteration computational cost makes it well-suited for solving large-scale or real-time problems where traditional optimisation routines become computationally burdensome. Despite its strong convergence guarantees, Dykstra's algorithm is known to suffer from stalling -- arbitrarily long intervals during which the primal iterates remain constant -- rendering its runtime unpredictable and severely limiting its applicability in time-critical settings. Focusing on polyhedral constraint sets, we derive a closed-form solution for the length of the stalling period once stalling is detected. This result enables a modified, stall-averse version of Dykstra's algorithm that fast-forwards the stalling period via a single, inexpensive update while preserving convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence behaviour, establishing the proposed method as a practical enhancement for a broad class of projection-based algorithms."}

Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincaré recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games."}

Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection."}

In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.\n  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science."}

The second is a suitably localized version of the relation of almost-compact embeddings, which has been successfully used to study compactness in function spaces over measure spaces of finite measure, but becomes of no use in the case of infinite measure.

Hence, stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed. Moreover, the accuracy of VEM deteriorates in case of problems with variable coefficients, that are not usually accounted when constructing polynomial projections. The mentioned aspects might limit the use of the method when tackling real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy, while suffering from worse conditioning.

Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can function as relay nodes to compensate for air-to-ground channel degradation, the satellite-to-UAV link remains a critical bottleneck. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution to enhance spectral efficiency by transmitting essential semantic information. This paper proposes a novel multi-cluster UAV-aided SAGIN SemCom architecture that supports both semantic users (SemUsers) and conventional users (ConUsers). While SemCom is employed in the satellite-to-UAV link to improve transmission efficiency, the UAVs implement an intelligent adaptive relay strategy, capable of either directly forwarding semantic data to SemUsers or converting it into bit-level data for ConUsers. Compared to existing similar schemes, this design guarantees the high-efficiency advantages of SemCom while enabling network access for larger coverage area. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system's sum-rate through coordinated allocation of power, bandwidth, and UAV positions. To address this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of both sum-rate and spectral efficiency across various channel conditions and user distributions, underscoring the importance of joint resource allocation and intelligent UAV deployment."}

Thanks to the dimensionality reduction and the natural handling of unbounded domains, boundary integral formulations are particularly appealing in the IgA framework. However, they require the evaluation of boundary integrals whose kernels exhibit singular or nearly singular behavior. Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates."}

The relativistic formulation provides a physically consistent setting for multi-species systems where inertia and internal energy depend on temperature, as occurs in astrophysical plasmas or relativistic fluids. Using the entropy principle, we derive uniform lower bounds for temperature and establish asymptotic flocking under various communication kernels. For nearly constant interactions, flocking emerges from arbitrary initial data.

As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively.

Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions.

Statistical analysis demonstrates that: (i) spatial position optimization in FRIS provides noticeable gains over conventional RIS in the absence of phase-shift design; (ii) such benefits vanish when FRIS and conventional RIS employ optimal beamforming (BF) and phase shift (PS) design, making position optimization irrelevant; (iii) FRIS consistently outperforms compact RIS with optimized BF and PS design, owing to spatial correlation and smaller aperture."}

Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \\textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \\iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\\textit{item-level}) and \\textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $μ\\in \\R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \\iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \\textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data."}

Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system."}

Storing the solution's finite element coefficients explicitly requires $\\mathcal O(n \\log n)$ bits of storage, where $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper presents a full multigrid method to compute the solution in a compressed format that reduces the storage complexity of the solution and intermediate vectors to $\\mathcal O(n)$ bits. This reduction allows a matrix-free implementation to solve elliptic PDEs with an overall linear space complexity. For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids."}

Encoded pilots are used to strengthen the iterative processing, leveraging both pilot and parity bits, while previous estimates are incorporated to further reduce overhead.

A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.\n  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction."}

In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques."}

The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states.

Numerical evaluations show that optimizing element placement in FRIS significantly improves SOP compared to conventional RIS without phase adaptation. However, these improvements become less evident once the conventional RIS implements optimized beamforming (BF) and phase-shift (PS) controlling.

We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval."}

Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest.\n  A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes\", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields.

Individuals are either ignorants, spreaders, or stiflers; spreaders stop by contact with other spreaders or stiflers or after an independent random waiting time sampled from a given distribution, modeling a spontaneous loss of interest. The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states. The mean-field limit is described by a system of nonlinear integral equations, while fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian and governed by a system of stochastic integral equations with explicit covariance. Our results show how the topology and the law of spontaneous stifling jointly shape the speed and variability of rumor outbreaks. As a special case, our model reduces to the classical Maki-Thompson model when spontaneous stifling is absent."}

Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs."}

Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets."}

The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \\leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity.

A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.\n  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions."}

However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network.

In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the Lévy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures.

Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O."}

Unfortunately many control design problems are non-convex: approximations, relaxations, or iterative schemes are usually employed to solve them. Several such approaches have been developed in the literature, for example Sum-of-Squares (SOSs) methods have been used for systems described by polynomial dynamics. Alternatively, and relevant to this paper, one can choose a (non-unique) linear-like representation of the system and solve the resulting state-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) or use SOSs optimisation techniques to derive a control law. This SOS method has been shown to effectively design polynomial and rational controllers for nonlinear polynomial systems, offering a broader class of controllers and the potential for improved performance and robustness guarantees. In this paper, we start off by considering rational functions as controllers for nonlinear systems and propose a procedure for designing such controllers by iteratively solving convex SOS optimisation problems. Our approach decouples the controller structure from the system dynamics and incorporates it as a constraint within the optimisation problem, which results in an optimisation that co-designs aspects of the controller and the Lyapunov function at the same iterative step. We theoretically establish the properties of this procedure by showing that several existing rational controller design methods can be recovered as special cases of this procedure. The proposed method is evaluated on various nonlinear benchmark system examples, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over both polynomial controllers and rational controllers obtained by existing approaches."}

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures.

Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation.

In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the Lévy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures.

We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature."}

Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound."}

Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale.

Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix.

In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation.

The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

This new stability assumption, together with a symmetry property of the system, allows us to derive an exponential turnpike property for those solutions that are close to the stationary one. Finally, through a fixed-point argument, we establish the actual existence of stable solutions, both on the finite horizon $[0,T]$ and on the infinite horizon, provided that the initial (and terminal) data are close enough to the stationary equilibrium."}

In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available."}

By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference."}

We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets."}

Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $β$-smooth and $γ$-strongly convex / concave, where $β$ and $γ$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $ρ$ and $σ$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision.

The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach."}

But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott channel.The transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal."}

This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Leblé and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure."}

A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations."}

This paper introduces a general Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to model and solve, in an exact way, problems whose solutions are weak orders (a.k.a.\\ bucket orders). Within this framework, we consider additional relevant constraints to produce the consensus bucket order, considering configurations with a fixed number of buckets, predefined bucket sizes, top-$k$ type problems, and fairness constraints. All these formulations are developed in a general setting, allowing their application to different rank aggregation contexts. One of these problems is the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), for which we propose for the first time an exact formulation and test the variants proposed.

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10).

To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping."}

A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.\n  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction."}

Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical \"domain shift\" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment."}

Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions."}

Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks.

Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions."}

Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators.

Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures.

This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$.

These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets.

Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks.\n  A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method.\n  These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems."}

By relying on a simple Black-Scholes-type market model for mid-prices and using continuous trading schemes, we define a dynamic family of superhedging sets in continuous time and express them in terms of set-valued integrals. We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets."}

A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.\n  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions."}

Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties.\n  For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function.\n  These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network.

The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality."}

Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer.

In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study."}

To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.\n  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered.

While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations.

In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the Lévy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a Lévy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework."}

Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively.

While there exist a number of open-source PCE toolboxes, tailored open-source codes for the solution of OCPs involving additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances in julia are not available. Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox PolyOCP.jl which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions. We explain the main mathematical concepts between the PCE transcription of stochastic OCPs and how they are provided in the toolbox. We draw upon two examples to illustrate the functionalities of PolyOCP.jl."}

The key ingredient is a regularized Gibbs weight that stabilizes the consensus point and avoids degeneracies present in the classical formulation, eliminating the need for cutoffs, rescaling, or boundedness assumptions on the objective function. Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights. Together, these results yield a unified and internally consistent theoretical framework for consensus-based optimization under substantially relaxed regularity assumptions on the objective function."}

Tomescu"], "title": "Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators", "categories": ["cs.DS", "math.OC", "q-bio.GN"], "comment": null, "summary": "Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.\n  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.\n  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications."}

We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions."}
