To solve the PM-PB model, we designed a\nregularized Matched Interface and Boundary (MIB) method to analytically\nregularizes the singular source term in the PMPB model while maintains 2nd\norder accuracy by rigorously treating the interface conditions. The accuracy of\nthe method is validated on Kirkwood sphere with available analytical solutions\nand on proteins whose charge distribution are assigned using AMOEBA force\nfield."}

First, the original\nVlasov-Maxwell system is reduced to a nonlinear singular system of ordinary\ndifferential equations governing the electric and magnetic field potentials.\nSubsequently, this system is further reduced to a novel nonlinear singular ODE\nfor an effective potential $\\theta(x).$ The existence of non-negative solutions\nto this final equation is established on the interval $[0, x^{*})$, where\n$\\theta(x)>0$. This is achieved by reformulating the associated initial value\nproblem into a system of coupled nonlinear Fredholm integral equations and\nproving the existence of fixed points for the corresponding operators. The most\nsignificant and previously unexplored case occurs when $\\theta(x)<0$ on the\ninterval $(x^{*}, 1]$, which corresponds to the fully insulated diode. For this\nregime, we present a novel numerical analysis of complex solution bifurcations,\nexamining their dependence on system parameters and boundary conditions.\nBifurcation diagrams illustrating the solution $\\theta(x)$ as a function of the\nfree boundary $x^{*}$ is constructed, and the insulated diode spacing is\ndetermined."}

Existing estimators either assume\nnoninformative covariate censoring, where time of study exit is independent of\ntime of diagnosis, or allow informative covariate censoring, but require\ncorrectly specifying how these times are related.

To prove this, we consider an inf-compact perturbation to the\nrunning cost over the entire space such that the resulting ergodic risk\nsensitive control problem is well-defined and then use the corresponding\nexisting results. The heart of the analysis lies in exploiting the variational\nformula of exponential functionals of Brownian motion and applying it to the\nobjective exponential cost function of the controlled diffusion.

It allows\nthe cluster-forming threshold to be increased in order to locate the signal\nwith greater spatial precision without overfitting, also known as the\ndrill-down approach. Notip and pARI are two recent permutation-based extensions\nof ARI designed to increase statistical power by accounting for the strong\ndependence structure typical of fMRI data. A recent comparison between these\npapers based on large voxel clusters concluded that pARI outperforms Notip. We\nrevisit this conclusion by conducting a systematic comparison of the two.

Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new\ndesign principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new\nassociative memory models based on information-theoretic goals."}

The recently proposed phase diffusion method proposed a\ngeneral way to overcome the challenge. This method is used and demonstrated in\ndetail in this paper to determine the phase evolution in a quadric field (n =\n4). Three different types of phase evolution in the quadric gradient field are\nobtained.

The proof of our main result relies on a\nfine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows\nus to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local\nversion of the star-mesh transformation."}

We show that for\nfundamental gene regulation network, the bio-controller derived from LQR theory\nprecisely recapitulate natural network motifs, such as auto-regulation and\nincoherent feedforward loops. This emulation arises from a fundamental\nprinciple: the LQR cost function mathematically encodes environmental survival\ndemands, which subsequently drives the selection of both network topology and\nbiochemical parameters. Our work thus establishes a theoretical basis for\ninterpreting biological circuit design, directly linking evolutionary pressures\nto observable regulatory structures."}

Building on this\ninsight, we exploit the geometric properties of the equivalent\nconstrained-zonotope reformulation to accelerate the computation of the\nexplicit solution. Specifically, we formulate the multi-parametric problem in\nthe lifted generator space and solve it using second-order optimality\nconditions, employ low-rank matrix updates to reduce computation time, and\nintroduce an analytic enumeration of candidate active sets that yields the\nexplicit solution in tree form."}

However, it converges slowly due to the inherent\ncurse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the\nhigh-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a\nnovel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive\ndirectional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,\nConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.\nThis concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more\nlikely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,\nwhen finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than\nMeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods."}
