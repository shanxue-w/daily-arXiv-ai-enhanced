Due to the inherent nonlinearity of contact problems, conventional methods that treat the entire domain as a monolithic system often lead to high global complexity. To address this, we develop an iterative contact-resolving hybrid method by localizing nonlinear contact constraints within a smaller subdomain, while the larger subdomain is governed by a linear system. Our system employs variational inequality theory, minimization principles, and penalty methods. More importantly, we propose four discretization types within the two-subdomain framework, ranging from applying standard/mixed FEM across the entire domain to combining standard/mixed multiscale methods in the larger subdomain with standard/mixed FEM in the smaller one. % The standard finite element method and standard constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method are simple and easy to demonstrate. By employing a multiscale reduction technique, the method avoids excessive degrees of freedom inherent in conventional methods in the larger domain, while the mixed formulation enables direct stress computation, ensures local momentum conservation, and resists locking in nearly incompressible materials. Convergence analysis and the corresponding algorithms are provided for all cases. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the approaches."}

Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations."}

Standard regularization methods typically produce solutions in or near the orthogonal complement of the forward operator's null space. This often leads to inadequate results, where internal sources are mistakenly interpreted as being near the data acquisition sites -- e.g., near or at the body surface in connection with EEG and ECG recordings.\n  To mitigate this, we previously proposed weighting schemes for Tikhonov and sparsity regularization. Here, we extend this approach to total variation (TV) regularization, which is particularly suited for identifying spatially extended regions with approximately constant values. We introduce a weighted TV-regularization method, provide supporting analysis, and demonstrate its performance through numerical experiments. Unlike standard TV regularization, the weighted version successfully recovers the location and size of large, piecewise constant sources away from the boundary, though not their exact shape.\n  Additionally, we explore a hybrid weighted-sparsity and TV regularization approach, which better captures both small and large sources, albeit with somewhat more blurred reconstructions than the weighted TV method alone."}

This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.\n  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence.

Iterating this procedure yields the result that all polyharmonic functions of sublinear growth are constant.The key innovation is a new $L^{2}$ estimate for the Laplacian of a polyharmonic function, obtained by induction through a delicate cutoff construction combined with a hole--filling argument. This provides the first sharp geometric extension of the Euclidean classification of polyharmonic functions to manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature, and completes a natural hierarchy of Yau--type Liouville theorems for iterates of the Laplacian."}

Type theory provides a syntax in which elements, functions, and relations can be expressed in simple terms, while categorical semantics supplies their mathemusical interpretation. Within this system, reasoning itself becomes constructive: propositions and proofs are treated as objects, yielding a framework in which the formation of structures and the reasoning about them take place within the same mathematical language.

First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $κ$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $κ> 0$. Our results suggest that progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) is best understood as a flow on moduli of benchmarks, driven by GVU dynamics rather than by scores on individual leaderboards."}

For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $κ^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $α$ and on the limiting curvatures $κ_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(α)\\,r_0(α,κ_+, κ_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(α)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(π/2)=1/(16\\sqrtπ)$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient.

The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points.\n  The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe."}

Our approach bypasses the time-consuming iterative steps of conventional models by directly learning the average velocity field. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based approach.

Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $Δ_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\\infty}_{W,V}(\\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability. As a final application we establish existence results for generalized fractional stochastic and deterministic differential equations, as well as for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations acting on nuclear spaces."}

Submited to the Journal of Computational Physics", "summary": "Several researchers have developed a rich toolbox of matrix compression techniques that exploit structure and redundancy in large matrices. Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail. Initial work by Le Borne addressed this by modifying the admissibility criterion for structured grids with constant convection, but challenges remain for more general grids and advection fields. In this work, we propose a novel partitioning strategy based on \"convection tubes\", clusters aligned with the convection vector field. This method does not require a structured grid or constant convection, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. We present both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for convection-dominated PDEs on unstructured grids. The approach builds on a Péclet-robust Caccioppoli inequality, crucial for handling convection-dominated problems."}

We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021).

This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions.

We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility."}

We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms.

Their rapid development and spread have led to applications even beyond the traditional fields of science. As far as dynamical systems and differential equations are concerned, neural networks and sparse identification tools have emerged as powerful approaches to recover the governing equations from available temporal data series. In this chapter we first illustrate possible extensions of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, originally developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to delay differential equations (DDEs) with discrete, possibly multiple and unknown delays. Two methods are presented for SINDy, one directly tackles the underlying DDE and the other acts on the system of ODEs approximating the DDE through pseudospectral collocation. We also introduce another way of capturing the dynamics of DDEs using neural networks and trainable delays in continuous time, and present the training algorithms developed for these neural delay differential equations (NDDEs). The relevant MATLAB implementations for both the SINDy approach and for the NDDE approach are provided. These approaches are tested on several examples, including classical systems such as the delay logistic and the Mackey-Glass equation, and directly compared to each other on the delayed Rössler system. We provide insights on the connection between the approaches and future directions on developing data-driven methods for time delay systems."}

As a result, there is growing interest in evaluating the opportunity cost of stored energy, or usage values, which can be derived by solving a multistage stochastic optimization problem. Stochasticity arises from net demand (the aggregation of demand and non-dispatchable generation), the availability of dispatchable generation, and inflows when the storage facilities considered are hydroelectric dams. We aim to compute these usage values for each market zone of the interconnected European electricity system, in the context of prospective studies currently conducted by RTE, the French TSO. The energy system is mathematically modelled as a directed graph, where nodes represent market zones and arcs represent interconnection links. In large energy systems, spatial complexity (thirty nodes in the system, each with at most one aggregated storage unit) compounds temporal complexity (a one-year horizon modelled with two timescales: weekly subproblems with hourly time steps). This work addresses three main sources of complexity: temporal, spatial, and stochastic. We tackle the multinode multistage stochastic optimisation problem by incorporating a spatio-temporal decomposition scheme. To efficiently compute usage values, we apply Dual Approximate Dynamic Programming (DADP), which enables tractable decomposition across both time and space. This approach yields nodal usage values that depend solely on the local state of each node, independently of the others. We conduct numerical studies on a realistic system composed of thirty nodes (modelling part of Europe) and show that DADP obtains competitive results when comparing with traditional methods like Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP)."}

We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms. We obtain a rigorous characterization of self-adjointness which indicates how to introduce a new notion of strong eigenvalues.

To implement an efficient RSMA scheme for the MU-MIMO system, in this work, we propose a novel robust precoding design, which can handle imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first adopt the generalized mutual information to construct a lower bound of the objective function in the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we apply a smooth lower bound of the non-smooth sum rate objective function to construct a new optimization problem. By revealing the relationship between the generalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the minimum mean square error matrices, we transform the constructed problem into a tractable one.

More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength.

Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings."}

In this paper, we first generalize sampling inequalities to spectral regularization, and then, by exploiting the connection between inverse problems and kernel approximation, we derive weak convergence rate bounds for inverse problems, independently of source conditions. These weak convergence rates are established and analyzed when the forward operator is compact and uniformly bounded, or the kernel operator is of trace class."}

While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches."}

However, classical block-type approaches quickly increase in computational costs when the rank of the constant term grows.

A Solids, 19(4):603-632, 2000] and propose a systematic methodology for capturing the directional variations induced by fibre orientation. The resulting permeability tensors are incorporated into macroscopic flow simulations based on the Darcy equation, enabling direct comparison of anisotropic and isotropic permeability models across several benchmark configurations. Our findings show that anisotropy has a significant impact on local flow direction and magnitude, generating directional permeability contrasts which cannot be reproduced by classical isotropic approximations. By integrating coil-induced microstructural effects into continuum-scale hemodynamic models, the proposed approach enables more realistic assessment of post-treatment aneurysm flow behaviour. Beyond this clinical application, the framework is broadly applicable to other biomedical and engineering systems involving fibrous or filamentous porous microstructures."}

However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."}

This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach.

Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability."}

This formulation does not require phase stability tests and provides a continuous and full mathematical description of the multiphysics system, suitable for challenging non-isothermal scenarios. To tackle the nonlinearities arising from phase transitions, we embed a local solver for the thermodynamic subproblem within a global Newton solver for the fully implicit system. The local solver exploits the locality of the subproblem for parallelization and leverages the modularity of the persistent-variable formulation for both isothermal and isenthalpic equilibrium conditions locally. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to simulate complex high-enthalpy systems, including narrow-boiling phenomena. The impact of the embedded local solver is analyzed through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in global nonlinear iterations of up to 23 \\% with increased use of the local solver. The number of local iterations is controlled with a local solver tolerance and no significant impact on the global iteration number was observed for local residual tolerances as high as $1e-3$.

A GPU-Oriented High-Order-Solver Perspective", "categories": ["physics.flu-dyn", "math.NA"], "comment": null, "summary": "High-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods offer excellent accuracy for turbulent flow simulations, especially when implemented on GPU-oriented architectures that favor very high polynomial orders. On modern GPUs, high-order polynomial evaluations cost roughly the same as low-order ones, provided the DG degrees of freedom fit within device memory. However, even with high-order discretizations, simulations at high Reynolds numbers still require some level of under-resolution, leaving them sensitive to numerical dissipation and aliasing effects. Here, we investigate the interplay between intrinsic DG dissipation mechanisms (implicit dissipation) -- in particular split forms and Riemann solvers -- and explicit subgrid-scale models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Using the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex at $Re = 1600$ and an inviscid case ($Re \\to \\infty$), we evaluate kinetic energy dissipation, spectral accuracy, and numerical stability.\n  Our results show that when stability for under-resolved turbulence is ensured through split-forms (energy- or entropy-stable) schemes, subgrid-scale (SGS) LES models are not strictly necessary. At moderate Reynolds numbers, when the spatial resolution is sufficient to capture the relevant turbulence scales (i.e., in well-resolved LES), adding SGS models does not improve accuracy because the wavenumber range where they act overlaps with the inherent numerical dissipation of the DG scheme. In contrast, when the resolution is insufficient, as is typical at high Reynolds numbers, explicit subgrid-scale models complement the numerical dissipation and enhance accuracy by removing the excess energy that numerical fluxes alone cannot dissipate.\n  These findings provide practical guidance for choosing numerical strategies in high-order turbulence simulations."}

Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate.

This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\\exp(-μ(\\log t)^ε)$ for some $μ,ε>0$) for analytic initial data. The proof is based on a collection of commuting vector fields, and certain combinatorial properties of an associated collection of differential operators.

In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive.\n  Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity. Consequently, the proposed unified ADI framework also serves as a recursive, interpolation-based model order reduction method, which can preserve several important properties of the original model in the reduced-order model."}

The robust control problem is reformulated as a convex optimization program by optimizing over configuration-constrained polytopic tubes and tracks a periodic trajectory that is optimal for a given economic criterion. Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant.

For the flow problem we consider incompressible Stokes equations with a pressure boundary condition on the top/bottom of the layer, and the transport problem is given by reaction-diffusion-advection problem with advective flow governed from the fluid velocity from the Stokes model and different scalings for the diffusion coefficient modelling low and fast diffusion in the horizontal direction. In the limit, a Darcy-type law is obtained for the Stokes flow with Darcy-velocity depending only on the derivative of the Darcy-pressure in the vertical direction. The effective equation for the transport problem is again of diffusion-advection-type including homogenized coefficients, and with advective flow given by the Darcy-velocity and only taking place in the vertical direction. In the case of slow diffusion in the vertical direction, effective diffusion only takes place in the vertical direction, where in the case of high diffusion in horizontal direction, we obtain effective diffusion in all space directions. To pass to the limit we use the method of two-scale convergence adapted to our microscopic geometry, which is based on uniform a priori estimates.

This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels."}

Our method is based on the G-minimal model program for surfaces and on the Sarkisov link factorisation of birational maps between Mori fibre spaces. We characterise rationality of surfaces, and in certain cases, birationality between surfaces in terms of the pieces of these decompositions, which we call atoms."}

This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.\n  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection."}

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios. Together, these results identify conditions for spectral gradient methods, such as Muon, to be effective in training deep networks and transformers."}

CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.\n  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions."}

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm.

In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region. Differences of relative entropies with respect to this weight give differences in generalized entropies. This provides an algebraic understanding of the order parameter that controls the phase transitions between entanglement wedges. We emphasize the role of operator-valued weights used in our construction."}

Under stronger conditions on the fluxes, we provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system that corresponds to the energy of the underlying dispersive equation. To approximate diffusive-dispersive equations, we rely on a viscoelastic damped system that is compatible with the found entropy for the hyperbolic approximation of the dispersive evolution. For the resulting hyperbolic-parabolic approximation, we provide a global well-posedness result. Using the relative entropy framework \\cite{dafermos2005hyperbolic}, we prove that the solutions of the approximate systems converge to solutions of the original equations. The structure of the new approximate systems allows to apply standard numerical simulation methods from the field of hyperbolic balance laws. We confirm the convergence of our approximations even beyond the validity range of our theoretical findings on set of test cases covering different target equations. We show the applicability of the approach for strong nonlinear effects leading to oscillating or shock-layer-forming behavior."}

Recent literature has made significant contributions in proving non-asymptotic convergence rates, but existing approaches have a few drawbacks that pose barriers for practical implementation.

This paper proposes a new algorithm that overcomes these drawbacks for a particular class of discrete-time systems. This algorithm leverages direct Model-Reference Adaptive Control (direct MRAC) and combines it with an epoch-based approach in order to address the drawbacks (i)-(iii) with a provable high-probability regret bound comparable to existing literature.

We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations.

This problem constitutes a nonlinear boundary value problem, whose general solvability is not yet established. In this paper {\\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields ${\\bf H}$ outside the unit sphere $S^2$ are studied and, given an axisymmetric Hölder continuous intensity function $I\\neq 0$ on $S^2$, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the intensity problem is proved.

Fix $q = p^m$ some power of an odd prime, and let $k \\leq n$ both be growing. For a uniformly random $n \\times k$ matrix $A$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we study the probability that all $k \\times k$ submatrices of $A$ have zero permanent; namely that $A$ does not have full \"permanental rank\". When $k = n$, this is simply the probability that a random square matrix over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ has zero permanent, which we do not understand. We believe that the probability in this case is $\\frac{1}{q} + o(1)$, which would be in contrast to the case of the determinant, where the answer is $\\frac{1}{q} + Ω_q(1)$. Our main result is that when $k$ is $O(\\sqrt{n})$, the probability that a random $n \\times k$ matrix does not have full permanental rank is essentially the same as the probability that the matrix has a $0$ column, namely $(1 +o(1)) \\frac{k}{q^n}$. In contrast, for determinantal (standard) rank the analogous probability is $Θ(\\frac{q^k}{q^n})$.

However, classical block-type approaches quickly increase in computational costs when the rank of the constant term grows. In this paper, we propose a novel tangential reformulation of the ADI iteration that allows for the efficient construction of low-rank approximations to the solution of Lyapunov equations with indefinite right-hand sides even in the case of constant terms with higher ranks. We provide adaptive methods for the selection of the corresponding ADI parameters, namely shifts and tangential directions, which allow for the automatic application of the method to any relevant problem setting.

We present a novel, multi-phase optimization approach for automatically generating WCAG-compliant colors while minimizing perceptual change to original design choices.\n  Our method treats this as a constrained, non-linear optimization problem, utilizing the modern perceptually uniform OKLCH color space. Crucially, the optimization is constrained to preserve the original hue ($\\text{H}$) of the color, ensuring that modifications are strictly limited to necessary adjustments in lightness ($\\text{L}$) and chroma ($\\text{C}$). This is achieved through a three-phase sequence: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation.\n  Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs demonstrates that the algorithm successfully resolves accessibility violations in $77.22\\%$ of cases, with $88.51\\%$ of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference ($ΔE_{2000} < 2.0$) as defined by standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is only $0.76\\ ΔE_{2000}$, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of $0.876\\text{ms}$ per color pair.\n  The approach demonstrates that accessibility compliance and visual design integrity can be achieved simultaneously through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization that respects brand identity.

The vector fields are not explicit, but are shown to have good properties when $t$ is large with respect to the momentum support of the solution. A physical space dyadic localisation is employed to treat non-compactly supported (in particular, non-trivial real analytic) but suitably decaying solutions."}

We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem."}

Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $α$ and on the limiting curvatures $κ_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(α)\\,r_0(α,κ_+, κ_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(α)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector.

Submited to the Journal of Computational Physics", "summary": "Several researchers have developed a rich toolbox of matrix compression techniques that exploit structure and redundancy in large matrices. Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail. Initial work by Le Borne addressed this by modifying the admissibility criterion for structured grids with constant convection, but challenges remain for more general grids and advection fields. In this work, we propose a novel partitioning strategy based on \"convection tubes\", clusters aligned with the convection vector field. This method does not require a structured grid or constant convection, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. We present both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for convection-dominated PDEs on unstructured grids. The approach builds on a Péclet-robust Caccioppoli inequality, crucial for handling convection-dominated problems."}

We establish the local analyticity of the Lyapunov moment function and the unique stationary measure on the projective space with respect to $μ$ in the total variation topology. As a consequence, we obtain the analyticity of the asymptotic variance and all higher-order Lyapunov moments."}

We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality."}
