Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to\nbalance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this\nbalance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with\nrespect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the\nscheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or\nthe basis functions that approximate the solution.\n  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating\npolynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is\n$\\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for\nsymmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for\na $p^\\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are\nnecessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in\nfinite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local\ndifferential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global\nintegral operators that yield dense matrices.\n  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle\nquadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one\ndimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our\nobservation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees\nconverge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular\nmeshes."}

Our goal is to find a full state feedback that\nmakes a given reference profile locally asymptotically stable.

We derive the Riccati partial differential equation\nwhose solution is the kernel of the optimal cost. The optimal state feedback is\nalso found. The derivation is accomplished by elementary techniques such as\nintegration by parts and completing the square.

However, the vast\nmajority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully\nobserved data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an\nassumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often\nmissing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In\naddition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to\ndropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such\ncoarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of\nwell-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and\nefficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of\nobtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given\ncoarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve\nour goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the\noutcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened\ndata, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our\nprincipled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating\nflexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the\nunderlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward\napplication of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals\nwith stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the\nconstruction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness\nscenarios.

Although numerical schemes for SDDEs with delays\n$\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_K$ are theoretically established, their implementations\nrequire evaluations at both present times such as $t_n$, and also at delayed\ntimes such as $t_n-\\tau_k$ and $t_n-\\tau_l-\\tau_k$. As a result, previous\nsimulations of these schemes have been largely restricted to the case of\ndivisible delays. We develop simulation techniques for the general case of\nindivisible delays where delayed times such as $t_n-\\tau_k$ are not restricted\nto a uniform time mesh. To achieve order of convergence (OoC) $1/2$, we\nimplement the schemes with a fixed step size while using linear interpolation\nto approximate delayed scheme values.

It is\nalso important that the gridshell is in equilibrium mainly with axial forces\nagainst the design loads; i.e., bending deformation should be avoided. In this\nstudy, we first find a continuous shell surface where the principal curvature\nlines coincide with the principal directions of membrane forces. For this\npurpose, we utilize the L-isothermic surface, which is a kind of membrane\nO-surface. Specifically, the generalized Dupin cyclide is used as the reference\nsurface, which has an explicit form of membrane forces with a single arbitrary\nparameter against normal loads. Various force distributions are obtained as the\nparameter is adjusted without changing the surface shape. Next, the shell is\ndiscretized into a gridshell, and target axial forces are obtained from the\nsection length of the covering region of each node. The axial forces are\nadjusted by optimizing the cross-sectional radii of the beams with pipe\nsections to realize the specified target force distribution. Since the Laguerre\ntransformation preserves geometric and static properties of the L-isothermic\nsurface, the force can be adjusted by a simple process without re-optimization\nto obtain an approximate optimal solution of the gridshell after\ntransformation. The ratio of out-of-plane shear force to the normal load at the\nnode is also evaluated to investigate the effect of deformation on the force\ndistribution."}

Take-off\nand merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the\ncoordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety\nand seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management\nand trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first\nintroduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one\nof the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the\ntake-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and\nmerging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace\ndesign can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the\ntrajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance\ncomplexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the\nefficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a\nscheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic\nmerging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging\nprocesses. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures\nthat each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while\nsatisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to\nrepresentative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM\nstrategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces\ncomputational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic\nconditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and\nthe computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design."}

Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024].

This half\nderivative makes the solution distribution-valued, so that proper\nrenormalization is needed to make sense of the solution.\n  We show that if the noise is sufficiently small, then an analogue of the\nclassical results by \\cite{Fun95,BBDMP98} holds in this singular regime. More\nprecisely, for initial data close to the traveling wave solution of the\ndeterministic equation, under proper long time scaling, the solution still\nstays close to the family of traveling waves, and the interface location moves\naccording to an approximate diffusion process. There is one interesting\ndifference between our singular regime and the classical situation: even if the\nsolution and its approximate phase separation point are both well defined, the\nintended diffusion describing the movement of the canonical candidate of the\nphase point is not (even for fixed $\\eps$). Two infinite quantities arise from\nthe derivation of such an SDE, one due to singularity of the noise, and the\nother from renormalization. Magically, it turns out that they cancel out each\nother, thus making the derivation of the interface SDE valid in the $\\eps\n\\rightarrow 0$ limit."}
