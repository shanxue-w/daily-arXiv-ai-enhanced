In this work we examine conditions under\nwhich unbiased tests exist for discrete statistical models. It is shown that\nthe existence of an unbiased test can be reduced to an algebraic criterion; an\nunbiased test exists if and only if there exists a polynomial that separates\nthe null and alternative hypothesis sets. This places a strong, semialgebraic\nrestriction on the classes of null hypotheses that have unbiased tests. The\nminimum degree of a separating polynomial coincides with the minimum sample\nsize that is needed for an unbiased test to exist, termed the unbiasedness\nthreshold. It is demonstrated that Gr\\\"obner basis techniques can be used to\nprovide upper bounds for, and in many cases exactly find, the unbiasedness\nthreshold.

This AMG method extends an idea proposed by Reitzinger and Schoberl.\nThe main feature of the Reitzinger and Schoberl algorithm (RSAMG) is that it\nmaintains null-space properties of the Curl-Curl operator throughout all levels\nof the AMG hierarchy. It does this by enforcing a commuting relationship\ninvolving grid transfers and the discrete gradient operator. This null-space\npreservation property is critical to the algorithm's success, however enforcing\nthis commuting relationship is non-trivial except in the special case where one\nleverages a piece-wise constant nodal interpolation operator. For this reason,\nmesh independent convergence rates are generally not observed for RSAMG due to\nits reliance on sub-optimal piece-wise constant interpolation. We present a new\nAMG algorithm that enforces the same commuting relationship. The main advance\nis that the new structure preserving H-curl algorithm (SpHcurlAMG) does not\nrely on piece-wise constant interpolation and can leverage fairly general and\nmore sophisticated nodal interpolation operators. The key idea is to employ\nenergy minimization AMG (EAMG) to construct edge interpolation grid transfers\nand to enforce the commuting relationship by embedding it as constraints within\nan EAMG procedure. While it might appear that solving such a constrained energy\nminimization is costly, we illustrate how this is not the case in our context.\nNumerical results are then given demonstrating mesh independent convergence\nover a range of test problems."}

For the case that $g$ is the negative\nexponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the\nthe Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian.

In these notes, we give an exposition\nof the proof of the invariance of tautness under Lie sphere transformations due\nto \\'{A}lvarez Paiva. First we extend the definition of tautness of\nsubmanifolds of $S^n$ to the concept of Lie-tautness of Legendre submanifolds\nof the contact manifold $\\Lambda^{2n-1}$ of projective lines on the Lie quadric\n$Q^{n+1}$. This definition has the property that if $\\phi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ is\nan embedding of a compact, connected manifold $V$, then $\\phi(V)$ is a taut\nsubmanifold in $S^n$ if and only if the Legendre lift $\\lambda$ of $\\phi$ is\nLie-taut. Furthermore, Lie-tautness is invariant under the action of Lie sphere\ntransformations on Legendre submanifolds. As a consequence, we get that if\n$\\phi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ and $\\psi:V \\rightarrow S^n$ are two embeddings of a\ncompact, connected manifold $V$ into $S^n$, such that their corresponding\nLegendre lifts are related by a Lie sphere transformation, then $\\phi$ is a\ntaut embedding if and only if $\\psi$ is a taut embedding. Thus, in that sense,\ntautness is invariant under Lie sphere transformations. The key idea is to\nformulate tautness in terms of real-valued functions on $S^n$ whose level sets\nform a parabolic pencil of unoriented spheres in $S^n$, and then show that this\nis equivalent to the usual formulation of tautness in terms of spherical\ndistance functions, whose level sets in $S^n$ form a pencil of unoriented\nconcentric spheres."}

By\napplying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid\nlearning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric\nmachine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our\nframework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs\nvariational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical\nimplementations.

When this structure is known, at least\nlocally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part\nof the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions\nnaturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove\nredundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we\nintroduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the\noptimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve\ncurvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems\nand theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis\nunifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is\nleveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the\nempirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms."}

However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity\nconstraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex\nconstraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed\nconstraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of\nconvergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in\nsparse optimization.

We present a new variant of iterative\nhard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection\noperator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple\nalternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint.

To date, most GA results for high-dimensional time series\nare established on hyper-rectangles and their equivalence. In this paper, by\nconsidering the 2-Wasserstein distance and the collection of all convex sets,\nwe establish a general GA theory for a broad class of high-dimensional\nnon-stationary (HDNS) time series, extending the scope of problems that can be\naddressed in HDNS time series analysis. For HDNS time series of sufficiently\nweak dependence and light tail, the GA rates established in this paper are\neither nearly optimal with respect to the dimensionality and time series\nlength, or they are nearly identical to the corresponding best-known GA rates\nestablished for independent data. A multiplier bootstrap procedure is utilized\nand theoretically justified to implement our GA theory. We demonstrate by two\npreviously undiscussed time series applications the use of the GA theory and\nthe bootstrap procedure as unified tools for a wide range of statistical\ninference problems in HDNS time series analysis."}

These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely,\nwhen non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves\npropagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned\nfamily, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at\nthe Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the\npossible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In\nline with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an\ninstability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass\ninflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for\nthe spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing\nthe interior of a black hole.

In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth\ndata suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a\n``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected\nPrice law bounds.
