This\ncondition is caused by a reduced blood supply, leading to oxygen and other\nmetabolites deprivation; this energy deficit impairs ionic pumps and causes\ncellular swelling. In this work, this phenomenon is modeled through a\nvolumetric variation law that links cell swelling to local oxygen concentration\nand the percentage of blood flow reduction. The swelling law ties volume\nchanges to local oxygen and the degree of blood-flow depression, providing a\nsimple pathway from hypoxia to tortuosity-driven transport impairment. To study\nthe interplay between oxygen supply and excitability in brain tissue, we employ\na monodomain model coupled with specific neuronal ionic and metabolic models\nthat characterize ion and metabolite concentration dynamics. From a numerical\npoint of view, suitable space- and time-adaptive schemes are employed to\ncapture the sharp and fast-traveling wavefronts representing action potentials\nmore accurately.

The framework captures sophisticated\nfeatures such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected\nantenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user\nassociation and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system\nsum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating\nBSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional\nprogramming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm\nis proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem.

Another contribution of our\nanalysis is the detailed treatment of the $B^0_{\\infty,2}$ case, where a\ncrucial integration-by-parts technique is employed to adeptly handle the\nnonlinear advection term. This technique allows for a refined estimate that\neffectively transfers derivatives onto the test functions, mitigating the\ninherent analytical challenges posed by the low regularity of these spaces.

Service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed\nwith fully heterogeneous rates, where the service rate of each server can\ndiffer and may scale with the system size $N$. We study a queue length aware\nand service rate aware load balancing policy, Join-the-Fastest-Shortest-Queue\n(JFSQ), and demonstrate that it achieves asymptotic zero waiting time and\nprobability under the heavy traffic regimes, including both the\nSub-Halfin-Whitt ($\\alpha \\in (0,0.5)$) and Super-Halfin-Whitt ($\\alpha \\in\n[0.5,1)$) regimes. The performance bounds of waiting time and probability\nexplicitly capture the convergence rate w.r.t. the system size $N$ and show the\nnegative effect of server heterogeneity. Our analysis builds on the general\nframework of Stein's method with iterative state-space peeling, where we design\na sequence of Lyapunov functions to analyze the high-dimensional heterogeneous\nsystem without assuming exchangeability and monotonicity. Our analysis shows\nthat JFSQ efficiently utilizes servers with higher capacities, and the\nsteady-state system can be coupled with a single-server queue via Stein's\nmethod. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish delay\nperformance bounds of a load-balancing system with size $N$ and fully\nheterogeneous servers in heavy traffic."}

To\nsolve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization\nframework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive\nthe optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer\nlayer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA\npositions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we\nproceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization\n(AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional\nmechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both\nconventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks"}

We establish an equivalence between the stochastic\nsingle-level reformulation and the original constrained bilevel problem and\nprovide a non-asymptotic rate of convergence for the proposed method. The rate\nis further enhanced by employing variance reduction techniques. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic problems and real-world applications demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach."}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of\nhybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is\ncentered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted\nsignals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system\nby achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix.

Our techniques\nmoreover imply an interesting classical consequence: the hardness of computing\nor approximating the distance of classical codes with rate equal to 1/2.\n  One of the main motivations of the present work is a question raised by\nKapshikar and Kundu concerning the NP-hardness of approximation when there is\nan additive error proportional to a quantum code's length. We show that no such\nhardness can hold for hypergraph product codes. These observations suggest the\npossibility of a new kind of square root barrier."}

Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to\nthe flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our\ncohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag\nmanifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks\nintroduced by B.To\\\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework\nfor rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the\nequivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our\ncohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side,\nour approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy\ndecompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the\ndiagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of\nsubgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects\nintroduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory."}

In practice, when the number of exponential terms inside the\nlogarithm is large or infinite, optimization becomes challenging since\ncomputing the gradient requires differentiating every term. Previous approaches\nthat replace the full sum with a small batch introduce significant bias. We\npropose a novel approximation to LogSumExp that can be efficiently optimized\nusing stochastic gradient methods. This approximation is rooted in a sound\nmodification of the KL divergence in the dual, resulting in a new\n$f$-divergence called the safe KL divergence. The accuracy of the approximation\nis controlled by a tunable parameter and can be made arbitrarily small. Like\nthe LogSumExp, our approximation preserves convexity. Moreover, when applied to\nan $L$-smooth function bounded from below, the smoothness constant of the\nresulting objective scales linearly with $L$. Experiments in DRO and continuous\noptimal transport demonstrate the advantages of our approach over\nstate-of-the-art baselines and the effective treatment of numerical issues\nassociated with the standard LogSumExp and KL."}

Methodology/results: We develop a queueing-theoretic framework to\nmodel ride-sourcing operations at terminals and propose a novel lottery-based\ncontrol mechanism for the virtual queue. This non-monetary strategy works by\nprobabilistically assigning a driver's entry position. By directly influencing\ntheir expected waiting time, the mechanism in turn shapes their decision to\njoin the queue.

While many efforts were\ndevoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics\nof the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the\nso-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two\ndecades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The\nlow attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as\nintermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended\nquiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is\nthen natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the\ndependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of\ncrucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering\nproperties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative\nframework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable\nself-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter\nwe give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for\nthe description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is\nto put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based\ncomplexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov\nintermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where\nconcepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical\nphysics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited."}

Antsaklis"], "title": "Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability", "categories": ["eess.SY", "cs.SY", "math.OC"], "comment": "To be submitted to American Control Conference 2026", "summary": "Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to\nthe involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances,\ncomplex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the\nproblems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for\naddressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers\nfor subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis\nand control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems.\nTherefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and\ncontrol a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and\na network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing some existing\nresults on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we\nmodel the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the\ndissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method\nis then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to\nformulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)\nproblems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the\nfeasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of\nthe spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve\niterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient.\nThe proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only\nstable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods,\nsuch as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers\nsuperior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and\ndisturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed technique."}
