In particular, in our\npathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models\nand a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC\ncircuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D\nmodel consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left\nventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this\nrepresentation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to\nventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation\ncompared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D\nmodel, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify\nthe parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration\nprocess. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic,\npulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To\nmaintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy\nis developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to\nenhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an\naccurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of\nhypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for\nreal-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful\ninsights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone."}

Moreover, the introduction of recently\ndeveloped movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the\nperformance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant\nchallenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the\ncorresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we\nmaximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining\na minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To\nachieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive\ncombiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer\nand the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation\nresults show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial\nperformance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed\nantennas.

Optimal learning makes this neural\nFisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the\nsensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an\nexpansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the\nproperties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors\ngive the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We\nfind that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,\nthe class boundaries.

Many practical\nchallenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including\nthe considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial\ncomputational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of\nstatistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while\nenforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the\ngeneration of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack\nextremes therein.

This incompatibility is\nquantified by the gap between the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD)\nquantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound, which is not always attainable, and the\nasymptotically achievable Holevo bound. This work provides a comprehensive\nanalysis of this gap by introducing and contrasting two scalar measures. The\nfirst is the weight-independent quantumness measure $R$, which captures the\nintrinsic incompatibility of the estimation model. The second is a tighter,\nweight-dependent measure $T[W]$ which explicitly incorporates the cost matrix\n$W$ assigning relative importance to different parameters. We establish a\nhierarchy of bounds based on these two measures and derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for their saturation. Through analytical and numerical\nstudies of tunable qubit and qutrit models with SU(2) unitary encoding, we\ndemonstrate that the weight-dependent bound $C_{T}[W]$ often provides a\nsignificantly tighter approximation to the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ than the\n$R$-dependent bound, especially in higher-dimensional systems. We also develop\nan approach based on $C_{T}[W]$ to compute the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$\nanalytically.

Knuth\nconsidered a generalization of this problem whereby `big-choosers' arrive with\nprobability $p$ and remove a match from the box with the most number remaining,\nand `little-choosers' arrive with probability $1-p$ and remove a match from the\nbox with the least number remaining.\n  In this paper we consider Knuth's generalization for the case of $k$\nmatchboxes. We determine the generating function for the expected number of\nmatches remaining in $k-1$ matchboxes once a box first empties, a quantity we\nrefer to as the `residue'. Interestingly, this generating function is a\nquotient whose denominator contains a generating function for a special case of\nthe Raney numbers. The form for this generating function allows us to give an\nexpression for the expected residue in terms of a sum that involves diagonal\nstate return probabilities, where a diagonal state is a configuration in which\nall matchboxes each contain the same number of matches.

Boxes are chosen with equal\nprobability and a match removed each time. The problem concerns the law of the\nnumber of matches remaining in one box once the other box empties. Knuth\nconsidered a generalization of this problem whereby `big-choosers' arrive with\nprobability $p$ and remove a match from the box with the most number remaining,\nand `little-choosers' arrive with probability $1-p$ and remove a match from the\nbox with the least number remaining.\n  In this paper we consider Knuth's generalization for the case of $k$\nmatchboxes. We determine the generating function for the expected number of\nmatches remaining in $k-1$ matchboxes once a box first empties, a quantity we\nrefer to as the `residue'. Interestingly, this generating function is a\nquotient whose denominator contains a generating function for a special case of\nthe Raney numbers. The form for this generating function allows us to give an\nexpression for the expected residue in terms of a sum that involves diagonal\nstate return probabilities, where a diagonal state is a configuration in which\nall matchboxes each contain the same number of matches. We use analytic\ntechniques to determine the asymptotic behaviour of this expected value for all\nvalues of $p$, which involves the study of an asymmetric random walk.\n  We also consider the expected value of the order of the first return to a\ndiagonal state and determine its asymptotic behaviour. The coefficients of the\ndiagonal state probability generating function are shown to be related to\n`manila folder configurations in a filing cabinet', and we make this connection\nprecise.

This work shows that for any odd prime $p$ and any\nirreducible polynomial $P(t)\\in\\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, the so-called $p$-Cantor\nsequence provides a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture over\n$\\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, the concepts of maximal escape of mass and generic\nescape of mass are introduced. These lead to two natural variations of the KPS\nconjecture, both of which are shown to hold for all previous counterexamples."}

However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a\nsingle-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between\nunlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:\nthe risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning\nprocess, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To\naddress these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nproblem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by\nPivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike\ntraditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is\ndesigned to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation\nis governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',\nwhich allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this\ncapability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the\nquality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of\nPareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across\nvarious vision tasks."}

Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring\nalgorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems,\nincluding RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a\nheuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring\nalgorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic\noptimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a\nhardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial\noptimization.

We present the design of a probabilistic computing\nalgorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and\nexperimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for\nsolving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based\nfactoring.

However, trustworthiness issues in MAS\nremain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS\ninvolve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to\ncorruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have\nbeen developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent\nnodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly\nfocus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed\ngraph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive\ncapabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm\nfor MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the\nMAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts\nmalicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse\ndynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS\nenvironments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS\ndefense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy\napplications.
