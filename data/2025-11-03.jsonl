Each closed-form consists of a fixed\nnumber of elementary arithmetic operations drawn from the set: addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, integer division, and exponentiation.\n  Two families of closed-forms are developed. First, direct application of the\nhypercube method yields closed-forms $T_1(n)$, $T_2(n)$, $T_3(n)$, and $T_4(n)$\nexpressing the smallest prime divisor, largest non-trivial divisor, largest\nprime divisor, and greatest prime $\\leq n$, respectively. The\nfactorial-unwinding technique underlying these hypercube constructions leads to\nextreme symbolic complexity, motivating our main result: An alternative\nclosed-form $T(n)$ that avoids factorial-unwinding by synthesizing the\nquadratic residue invariants $\\chi(n)$ (largest $r$ such that $r^2$ is a\ndivisor) and $\\omega(n)$ (number of distinct prime divisors) with integer root\nextraction.\n  Although evaluating these closed-forms requires exponential time, the number\nof arithmetic operations performed remains constant and independent of the\ninput size $n$. This sharply contrasts with traditional algorithmic methods,\nwhere the number of operations required to locate a non-trivial divisor\nnecessarily scales with $n$."}

Operator learning aims to\napproximate mappings from input functions to output functions, where the latter\nare typically represented using basis functions. While non-learnable bases\nreduce training costs, learnable bases offer greater flexibility but often\nrequire deep network architectures with a large number of trainable parameters.\nExisting approaches typically rely on deep global bases; however, many PDE\nsolutions exhibit local behaviors such as shocks, sharp gradients, etc., and in\nparametrized PDE settings, these localized features may appear in different\nregions of the domain across different training and testing samples. Motivated\nby the use of local bases in finite element methods (FEM) for function\napproximation, we develop a shallow neural network architecture that constructs\nadaptive FEM bases. By adopting suitable activation functions, such as ReLU,\nthe FEM bases can be assembled exactly within the network, introducing no\nadditional approximation error in the basis construction process. This design\nenables the learning procedure to naturally mimic the adaptive refinement\nmechanism of FEM, allowing the network to discover basis functions tailored to\nintrinsic solution features such as shocks. The proposed learnable adaptive\nbases are then employed to represent the solution (output function) of the PDE.\nThis framework reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining\nhigh approximation accuracy, effectively combining the adaptivity of FEM with\nthe expressive power of operator learning.

This research develops a\ncomprehensive mathematical and simulation framework to quantify wait-time\ntrade-offs when multiple AI-triage devices operate simultaneously in a clinical\nworkflow. We created multi-QuCAD, a software tool that models complex multi-AI,\nmulti-disease scenarios using queueing theory principles, incorporating\nrealistic clinical parameters including disease prevalence rates, radiologist\nreading times, and AI performance characteristics from FDA-cleared devices. The\nframework was verified through four experimental scenarios ranging from simple\ntwo-disease workflows to complex nine-disease systems, comparing preemptive\nversus non-preemptive scheduling disciplines and priority versus hierarchical\ntriage protocols. Analysis of brain imaging workflows demonstrated that while\nAI-triage devices significantly reduce wait-times for target conditions, they\ncan substantially delay diagnosis of non-targeted, yet urgent conditions. The\nstudy revealed that hierarchical protocol generally provides more wait-time\nsavings for the highest-priority conditions compared to the priority protocol,\nthough at the expense of more delays to lower-priority patients with other\ntime-sensitive conditions.

Specially, a RIS-enhanced and\ndecode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under\ndynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and\nattack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal\nchannel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both\nsmall-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results\ndepict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge\nof the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm\nprobability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although\nperfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker\nperspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward\nrelays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that\nleads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also\nindicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion\nrule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying\nframework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking\neffectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes\nrather than the channel dynamics.

A novel memory-dependent Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (memFPK) equation is\ndeveloped to characterize the probability structure in such non-Markovian\nsystems. The main challenge in this research comes from the long-memory\ncharacteristics of FGN. These features make it impossible to model the\nFGN-excited nonlinear dynamical systems as finite dimensional GWN-driven\nMarkovian augmented filtering systems, so the classical FPK equation is no\nlonger applicable. To solve this problem, based on fractional\nWick-It\\^o-Skorohod integral theory, this study first derives the fractional\nIt\\^o formula. Then, a memory kernel function is constructed to reflect the\nlong-memory characteristics from FGN. By using fractional It\\^o formula and\nintegration by parts, the memFPK equation is established. {Importantly, the\nproposed memFPK equation is not limited to specific forms of drift and\ndiffusion terms, making it broadly applicable to a wide class of nonlinear\ndynamical systems subjected to FGN and GWN.} Due to the historical dependence\nof the memory kernel function, a Volterra adjustable decoupling approximation\nis used to reconstruct the memory kernel dependence term.

Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

To ensure that the surrogates are\ntailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\\'ern Gaussian process\nprior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric\ngraphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently\nsmooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the\nsmoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\\'ern prior is\nrepresented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on\na synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori\nestimation on a telecommunication network."}

On closed manifolds, we show that if the magnetic force is\nnowhere vanishing and the potential is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ norm,\nthen this Ricci curvature is positive for energies close to the maximum value\nof the potential $e_0$. As a main application, under these assumptions, we\nextend the existence of contractible closed orbits at energy levels near $e_0$\nfrom almost every to everywhere."}
