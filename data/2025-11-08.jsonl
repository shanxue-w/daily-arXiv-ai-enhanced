LMC may blow up when the drift field\n$\\nabla U$ is not globally Lipschitz, while iLMC has convergence guarantee when\nthe drift is only one-sided Lipschitz. Starting from an adapted continuous-time\ninterpolation, we prove a time-discretization error bound under the relative\nentropy (or the Kullback-Leibler divergence), where a crucial gradient estimate\nfor the logarithm numerical density is obtained via a sequence of PDE\ntechniques, including Bernstein method.

Compared to previously studied steady water waves, the\npresent setting introduces several novel features: the presence of an internal\ninterface, an unbounded spatial domain, and a non-Fredholm linearized operator.\nTo address these difficulties, we introduce a height function formulation,\ncasting the problem as a transmission problem with suitable transmission\nconditions.

During the transmission and coordination of autonomous vehicles,\nmalicious adversaries may attempt to compromise control commands or swarm\nbehavior, posing severe threats to road safety and vehicular intelligence. Many\nexisting authentication schemes claim to provide security against conventional\nattacks. However, recent developments in quantum computing have revealed\ncritical vulnerabilities in these schemes, particularly under quantum-enabled\nadversarial models.

We conduct formal security proofs based on quantum key\ndistribution and quantum adversary models, and also perform context-driven\nreauthentication analysis based on vehicular behavior. The output of quantum\nresilience evaluations indicates that QSAFE-V provides robust protection\nagainst quantum and contextual attacks.

A key\nstep in projection-based reduced order model methods is the use of a\nsesquilinear form associated with the forward boundary value problem. However,\nin contrast to scattering problems posed in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, boundary value\nformulations lose certain structural properties, most notably the classical\nLippmann-Schwinger integral equation is no longer available. In this paper we\nderive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a\nHelmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance\nboundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation\nof the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation\nwhich can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical\nLippmann-Schwinger equation.

In this paper we\nderive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a\nHelmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance\nboundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation\nof the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation\nwhich can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical\nLippmann-Schwinger equation. We first establish analytical properties of our\nvariational Lippmann-Schwinger type operator. Based on these results, we then\nshow that the parameter-to-state map, which maps a refractive index to the\ncorresponding wavefield, maps weakly convergent sequences to strongly\nconvergent ones when restricted to refractive indices in Lebesgue spaces with\nexponent greater than 2. Finally, we use the derived weak to strong sequential\ncontinuity to show existence of minimizers for a reduced order model based\noptimization methods aimed at solving the inverse boundary value problem as\nwell as for a conventional data misfit based waveform inversion method."}

Its key input is drawn from ten-dimensional\nnon-tachyonic string models where supersymmetry is absent or non-linearly\nrealized, and runaway ``tadpole potentials'' deform the ten-dimensional\nMinkowski vacua. We illustrate the perturbative stability of the resulting most\nsymmetrical setups, which are the counterparts of circle reduction but involve\ninternal intervals.

Such systems can be\napproximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role\nin the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated\nintegrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a\nuniversal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the\nstate or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In\ncontrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains\nfeasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear\nsystem grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is\ntypically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order\nreduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with\nnon-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially\nlow-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original\nnonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to\nlearn the linear map of the signature.

For odd n, numerical stability\nissues have required us to generalize the scheme originally proposed for n=0 by\nT. Sasamoto and H. Spohn. Precisely for n=1 and 3, and at variance with the n=0\nand 2 cases (whose numerical exponents are consistent with non-renormalization\nof the vertex), numerical strong coupling exponent values are obtained which\nsuggest vertex renormalization, akin to that reported for the celebrated\nconserved KPZ equation. We also study numerically the statistics of height\nfluctuations, whose probability distribution function turns out (at variance\nwith cKPZ) to have zero skewness for long times and at saturation, irrespective\nof the value of n. However, the kurtosis is non-Gaussian, further supporting\nthe conclusion on strong coupling asymptotic behavior. The zero skewness seems\nrelated with space symmetries of the n=0 and 2 equations, and with an emergent\nsymmetry at the strong coupling fixed point for odd values of n."}

A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that\npreserve the integrability.

In this article we develop an ODE based method to\nstudy the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum\nparameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an\nasymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is\nreferred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic\npseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.\nIn particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm\nconverges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than\na local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.\n  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the\nAdam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show\nthat in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a\nLyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a\nconsequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima\ninfinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima."}

The users submit their jobs to the central server\naccording to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a\ndedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that\njob in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job\nassigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free\nstate, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain.\nUpon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies\nthat the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to\nthe machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of\njobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age\nof job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost,\nwe propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance.
