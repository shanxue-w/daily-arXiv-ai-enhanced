Inspired by the move to a more\nreal-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have\ndeveloped a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of\npossible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson\nblending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.\nAdditionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding\nstrong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes\nnot only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image\ndegradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.\nSpecifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\\%$ and $6.21\\%$ AUC on the DFDC\nand DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,\nwe highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements\nin this regard.
