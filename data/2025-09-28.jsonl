A key challenge lies in\naccurately modeling the frictional contact behavior along fault surfaces. This\nproblem involves inequality constraints that arise from the physics of\nfrictional slip, requiring specialized numerical methods to handle the\nresulting highly nonlinear and path-dependent behavior. In this work, we\naddress this challenge using an augmented Lagrangian method implemented via the\nUzawa algorithm. The formulation employs mixed finite element spaces, combining\nlow-order piecewise linear displacements within the 3D domain cells with\npiecewise constant tractions defined on the fault surfaces. Furthermore, to\nensure stability and satisfy the inf-sup condition, the discrete displacement\nspace is enriched with face bubble functions on both sides of the contact\ninterfaces. This approach offers several advantages over other stabilization\ntechniques that rely on additional terms, as it does not require extra\nparameters for implementation, and it integrates naturally in the Uzawa\nframework."}

An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,\nthe number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In\nthe same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.\nFor example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions\nand data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger\ncodes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables\nswitching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while\nreducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable\nSC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design\nprobabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is\nachieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes\nmemory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of\nshort cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability\ndistribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown\ndistribution characterizing the additional components. We use the\ngradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of\ncycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to\ndesign any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other\ncases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC\ncodes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts\nand remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a\nliterature-based straightforward scheme."}

This can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in\nthe literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the\ntransmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading\ncoefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed\nthat the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,\nrigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds\ndepends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering\ncells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the\ninterferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay\nexponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit\npower. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited\nnetworks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews (\"Fundamental limits of\ncooperation\", IEEE Trans. Inf.

In\ncontrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,\nthen the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded\ncapacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since\nthe condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents\ninterference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple\naccess.

Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a\npromising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard\nbackbone.

The classical identities", "categories": ["math.NT", "math.CA", "math.CO"], "comment": "15 pages", "summary": "We use Bailey pairs to prove $q$-series identities at roots of unity due to\nCohen and Bryson-Ono-Pitman-Rhoades. The proofs use Bailey pairs with quadratic\nforms developed in the study of mock theta functions. In addition to the\nstandard Bailey lemma, we require some changes-of-base established by\nBressoud-Ismail-Stanton. We then embed the identities in infinite families\nusing the Bailey chain."}
