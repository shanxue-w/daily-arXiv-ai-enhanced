Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D."}

For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \\(S_N\\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.\n  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \\(N_{s}\\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \\(S_N\\) solve; \\(N_s=0\\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \\(N_s>0\\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.\n  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver."}

John model and Cummins' equations for freely floating objects", "categories": ["math.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $π/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally."}

While it is well known that the Gaussian prior uniquely induces linear conditional means under Gaussian noise, the analogous question for the conditional median (i.e., the optimal estimator under absolute-error loss) has only recently been settled. Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the Lévy metric. For $L^1$ loss, we introduce a Hermite expansion framework and analyze the adjoint of the linearity-defining operator to show that the Gaussian remains the unique stable solution.

Recently, Hoff (2023) showed that full conformal Bayes provides the most efficient prediction sets (smallest by expected volume) among all prediction sets that are valid at the $(1 - α)$ level if the model is correctly specified. However, a critical issue arises when the Bayesian model itself may be mis-specified, resulting in prediction set that might be suboptimal, even though it still enjoys the frequentist coverage guarantee. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative solution that combines Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with conformal prediction. This hybrid not only leverages the strengths of Bayesian conformal prediction but also introduces a layer of robustness through model averaging. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting prediction set will converge to the optimal level of efficiency, if the true model is included among the candidate models. This assurance of optimality, even under potential model uncertainty, provides a significant improvement over existing methods, ensuring more reliable and precise uncertainty quantification."}

The proof relies on constructing an isometric isomorphism between the Kaplansky-Hilbert module and the space of measurable sections of a Hilbert bundle, thereby reducing the problem to the application of the classical Mercer theorem on each fiber of the bundle.

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models."}

An important goal is to understand how the source data may improve the minimax convergence rate of learning the regression function when the likelihood ratio of the covariate marginal distributions of the target data and the source data are unbounded. A previous work of Pathak et al. (2022) show that the minimax transfer learning rate is simply determined by the faster rate of using either the source or the target data alone. In this paper, we present a new synergistic learning phenomenon (SLP) that the minimax convergence rate based on both data may sometimes be faster (even much faster) than the better rate of convergence based on the source or target data only. The SLP occurs when and only when the target sample size is smaller (in order) than but not too much smaller than the source sample size in relation to the smoothness of the regression function and the nature of the covariate densities of the source and target distributions. Interestingly, the SLP happens in two different ways according to the relationship between the two sample sizes. One is that the target data help alleviate the difficulty in estimating the regression function at points where the density of the source data is close to zero and the other is that the source data (with its larger sample size than that of the target data) help the estimation at points where the density of the source data is not small. Extensions to handle unknown source and target parameters and smoothness of the regression function are also obtained."}

By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field.

We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions."}

Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $τ$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.\n  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting.

Using this, we exactly characterize the sets of decidable theories that can be combined with those satisfying well-known theory combination properties. This strengthens previous results and answers in the negative several long-standing open questions about the possibility of improving existing theory combination methods to apply to larger sets of theories.

(2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability."}

Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee.

Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing. This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an $N$-port FAS operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel. By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \\times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$. Simulation results are provided to validate the high accuracy of our entire theoretical framework."}

We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense.

It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field.

Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss. The analysis relies on the regularity of the solution to the associated weakly coupled HJB systems, and their stochastic representation.

It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field.

Achieving this requires a more precise classification of right-censoring events than has historically been considered, as the nature of these events has direct implications for identification of the target estimand. We provide a framework that distinguishes different types of right-censoring events from a causal perspective, and demonstrate how this framework relates to censoring definitions and assumptions in classical survival analysis literature. By bridging these perspectives, we provide a clearer understanding of how to handle right-censoring events and provide guidance for identifying causal estimands when right-censored events are present."}

The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows."}

We present a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, and develop an efficient linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm where submodular and outer-approximation inequalities are used to replace the nonlinear constraints and are separated at the nodes of the search tree. One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances.

To validate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments on various problem instances, including the $\\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, quadratic programming, and compressive sensing. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency. This also demonstrates the potential of the stochastic algorithmic versions of these algorithms in application areas such as statistics, machine learning, and data mining. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to introduce how Güler's acceleration technique can be applied to gradient-based algorithms and to provide a unified and concise framework for their construction."}

We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees. Consider a rooted leaf-labeled tree in which internal nodes each have $i$ offspring, and $i$ is permitted to range from 2 to $r$ across internal nodes, for a specified value of $r$. For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \\geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \\geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology.

This conditioning regime was formulated through survival functions and termed the accelerated failure conditionals model. Subsequently, Lakhani (2025) extended this conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, thereby moving beyond families with non-increasing densities. The present study builds on this line of work by proposing a conditional survival specification derived from a location-scale distributional family, where the dependence between $X$ and $Y$ arises not only through the acceleration function but also via a location function. An illustrative example of this new specification is developed using a Weibull marginal for $X$. The resulting models are fully characterized by closed-form expressions for their moments, and simulations are implemented using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph.

Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure.

Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure.

Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.\n  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed."}

Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead."}
