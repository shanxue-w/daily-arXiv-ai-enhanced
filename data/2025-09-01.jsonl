They often work by satisfying some form of a\ndiscrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\nSchemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave\nmuch more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a\nnew strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity\npreserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in\norder to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity\npreserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction\nartificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy\ninequality.\n  In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial\nviscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve\nhigh order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and\nare hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme\nprovably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes\nequations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance\ntradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes."}

Capturing\nthis temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally\ndemanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is\nto approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known\nas representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly\ndegrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull\nclustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP\napproaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers\n(e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points,\nwhich are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base\nperiods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends),\nenabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs.\nThrough two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we\ndemonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP\ntechniques in both regret and computational efficiency."}

We develop a\nresistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict\npressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and\nquadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs\nnon-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow\nsplit prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the\nRRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We\nvalidate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across\nReynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D\nfinite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy\nimprovements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method\nreduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25\nmmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg\n(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high\nReynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical\napproach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision\nsupport, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular\nbiomedical engineering."}

Second, it identifies many examples of OSIs,\nincluding random sparse matrices, randomized trigonometric transforms, and\nrandom matrices with tensor product structure.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This\nwork establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for\ncreating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically\ncombining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures."}

In many applications, such as the development of\ndigital twins, it is essential to solve these optimization problems within\nwall-clock-time limitations. However, this is often unattainable for complex\nsystems, such as those modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations. One\nstrategy for mitigating this issue is to construct a reduced-order model (ROM)\nthat enables more rapid optimization. In particular, the use of nonintrusive\nROMs -- those that do not require access to the full-order model at evaluation\ntime -- is popular because they facilitate optimization solutions can be\ncomputed within the wall-clock-time requirements. However, the optimization\nsolution will be unreliable if the iterates move outside the ROM training data.\nThis article proposes the use of hyper-differential sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to model discrepancy (HDSA-MD) as a computationally efficient tool to\naugment ROM-constrained optimization and improve its reliability. The proposed\napproach consists of two phases: (i) an offline phase where several full-order\nmodel evaluations are computed to train the ROM, and (ii) an online phase where\na ROM-constrained optimization problem is solved, $N=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ full-order\nmodel evaluations are computed, and HDSA-MD is used to enhance the optimization\nsolution using the full-order model data. Numerical results are demonstrated\nfor two examples, atmospheric contaminant control and wildfire ignition\nlocation estimation, in which a ROM is trained offline using inaccurate\natmospheric data. The HDSA-MD update yields a significant improvement in the\nROM-constrained optimization solution using only one full-order model\nevaluation online with corrected atmospheric data."}

The proposed\nmethod was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions.\nResults demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior\naccuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based\nEKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct\ninitialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid\nconvergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive\ndead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the\nconventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting\nits suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover,\nrobustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where\nthe adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite\nparameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a\nreliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation."}

These states, derived from a\nperturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide\nenhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information\nand its associated quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound are used to define the\nfundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase\nsensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity\ndetection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection.\nThe performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cram\\'er Rao bound\nto evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable\nparameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities\napproaching the quantum limit, offering a flexible framework for precision\nquantum metrology."}

We first\ncharacterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we\nestablish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always\nachievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear\npayment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments\nrequired per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred\nwith information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a\none-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,\ntransforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of\nplayers' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high\nprobability, and support it with empirical results."}

This work advances its application to\nthe DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to\nuncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these\nproblems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional\nstatistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by\nderiving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We\npropose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to\ninform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality\nreduction.

We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance\ncompared to existing methods."}
