This composition yields families of functions that remain dense in the space of continuous functions, while enabling more accurate approximations. For univariate continuous functions exhibiting a finite number of local extrema, we prove that there exist a polynomial of finite degree and a homeomorphism whose composition approximates the target function to arbitrary accuracy. The construction is especially relevant for multivariate approximation problems, where standard numerical methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To support our theoretical results, we investigate both regression tasks and the construction of molecular potential-energy surfaces, parametrizing the underlying homeomorphism using invertible neural networks. The numerical experiments show strong agreement with our theoretical analysis."}

Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide an efficient means of approximating the Full Order Model (FOM) solution. We propose a novel approach for constructing ROMs of the Sn radiation transport equation, Offline Maximizing Minimally Invasive (OMMI) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). POD uses snapshot data to build a reduced basis, which is then used to project the FOM. Minimally Invasive POD leverages the sweep infrastructure within deterministic Sn transport solvers to construct the reduced linear system, even though the FOM linear system is never directly assembled. OMMI-POD extends Minimally Invasive POD by performing transport sweeps offline, thereby maximizing the potential speedup. It achieves this by generating a library of reduced systems from a training set, which is then interpolated in the online stage to provide a rapid approximate solution to the Sn transport equation. The model's performance is evaluated on a multigroup 2-D test problem, demonstrating low error and a 1600-fold speedup over the full order model."}

These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \\emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis."}

However, the thermodynamic effects of this regularization have not yet been understood in a principled manner. To achieve a proper understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of the IGR, we decompose the regularization into its conservative dynamics, framed as a Hamiltonian subsystem, and its dissipative dynamics. In so doing, we further introduce two more models to compare to IGR, the Hamiltonian regularized Euler (HRE) model, which is the first multi-dimensional, non-dispersive Hamiltonian regularization of the compressible Euler equations with energy, as well as the Hamiltonian IGR (HIGR) model, which modifies the dissipation used in the IGR model to instead utilize a metriplectic dissipative force. Despite having many attractive features, the HRE and HIGR models exhibit notable defects in numerical tests on colliding shock problems, which preclude their use as computational tools without further study of dissipative weak solutions to these models. Additionally, our analysis presents new results on the IGR model itself, including its ability to conserve acoustic waves, as well as local energy transport laws and entropy production rates. By separating the conservative and dissipative dynamics of the IGR, our hope is that subsequent of analysis of the IGR model can benefit from this natural decomposition, such as, for example, rigorous proofs of strong solutions for multi-dimensional IGR for the compressible Euler system with thermodynamics."}

It is shown that the asymptotics of several first eigenvalues is determined by the corner opening only, while the main term in the asymptotic expansion for the other eigenvalues is the same as for smooth curves. Under an additional assumption on the corners of $Γ$ (which is satisfied, in particular, if $Γ$ has no acute corners), a more detailed eigenvalue asymptotics is established in terms of a one-dimensional effective operator on the boundary."}

Motivated by this, we analyse codifference using as little assumptions as possible about the studied model. It leads us to propose its natural domain and three natural variants of it. Using the wide class of variable scale mixture distributions we argue that the codifference can be interpreted as the measure of bulk properties which ignores the tails much more than the covariance. It can also detect forms of non-linear memory which covariance cannot. Finally, we show the asymptotic distribution of its estimator."}

On a class of such ``spectral geometries'' we introduce abstract evaluators, required to satisfy natural invariance, locality, extensivity, and dominated-convergence continuity conditions. Our first main result is a trace-form representation theorem: on the natural trace-class envelope every such evaluator is given by the trace of a single nondecreasing profile applied through the functional calculus. Thus, once that profile and a scalar normalization are fixed, all admissible scalar values are determined by the underlying spectra, yielding a rigidity principle for evaluators in this setting. The second main result is a spectral growth taxonomy: we classify self-adjoint operators by counting-function asymptotics and show that the polynomial growth class is stable under the basic constructions of the calculus. Together these results provide an arithmetic-neutral analytic backbone for later parts of the series and for applications to concrete spectral models."}

Our unification is threefold: (i) we propose a unified decentralized learning strategy for minimax optimization that subsumes existing bias-correction techniques, such as gradient tracking, while introducing new variants that achieve tighter network-dependent bounds; (ii) we introduce a probabilistic gradient estimator, GRACE (Gradient Acceleration Estimator), which unifies momentum-based methods and loopless variance-reduction techniques for constructing accelerated gradients within DAMA, and is broadly applicable to general stochastic optimization problems; and (iii) we develop a unified analytical framework that establishes a general performance bound for DAMA, achieving state-of-the-art results with the best-known sample complexity.

On a class of such ``spectral geometries'' we introduce abstract evaluators, required to satisfy natural invariance, locality, extensivity, and dominated-convergence continuity conditions. Our first main result is a trace-form representation theorem: on the natural trace-class envelope every such evaluator is given by the trace of a single nondecreasing profile applied through the functional calculus. Thus, once that profile and a scalar normalization are fixed, all admissible scalar values are determined by the underlying spectra, yielding a rigidity principle for evaluators in this setting. The second main result is a spectral growth taxonomy: we classify self-adjoint operators by counting-function asymptotics and show that the polynomial growth class is stable under the basic constructions of the calculus. Together these results provide an arithmetic-neutral analytic backbone for later parts of the series and for applications to concrete spectral models."}

At the same time, a long-standing goal in statistics is the development of adaptive procedures -- methods that achieve near-optimal performance across diverse function classes without prior knowledge of underlying smoothness or complexity. While adaptation is often achievable at no extra cost in the classical non-private setting, this naturally raises a fundamental question: to what extent is adaptation still possible under privacy constraints?\n  We address this question in the context of density estimation under federated differential privacy (FDP), a framework that encompasses both central and local DP models. We establish sharp results that characterize the cost of adaptation under FDP for both global and pointwise estimation, revealing fundamental differences from the non-private case. We then propose an adaptive FDP estimator that achieves explicit performance guarantees by introducing a new noise mechanism, enabling one-shot adaptation via post-processing. This approach strictly improves upon existing adaptive DP methods. Finally, we develop new lower bound techniques that capture the limits of adaptive inference under privacy and may be of independent interest beyond this problem.\n  Our findings reveal a sharp contrast between private and non-private settings. For global estimation, where adaptation can be achieved for free in the classical non-private setting, we prove that under FDP an intrinsic adaptation cost is unavoidable. For pointwise estimation, where a logarithmic penalty is already known to arise in the non-private setting, we show that FDP introduces an additional logarithmic factor, thereby compounding the cost of adaptation. Taken together, these results provide the first rigorous characterization of the adaptive privacy-accuracy trade-off."}

The proposed formulation has three unknowns, one more than the number of unknowns for the ordinary formulation. However, we can construct efficient numerical solvers based on LU factorization by exploiting the sparse alignment of the boundary integral operators of the proposed formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the direct solver based on the proposed formulation is approximately 40% faster than the ordinary formulation when the LU-factorization-based solver is used. In addition, the proposed formulation is applied to a fast direct solver employing LU factorization in its algorithm. In the application to the fast direct solver, the proxy method with a weak admissibility low-rank approximation is developed. The speedup achieved using the proposed formulation is also shown to be effective in finding nonlinear eigenvalues, which are related to the uniqueness of the solution, in boundary value problems. Furthermore, the well-posedness of the proposed boundary integral equation is established for scatterers with boundaries of class $C^2$, using the mapping property of boundary integral operators in Hölder space."}

The trilinear monomial serves as one such fundamental library function, appearing frequently as a building block across diverse applications. By definition, its convex hull provides the tightest possible relaxation and thus serves as a benchmark for evaluating alternatives. Mixed volume techniques have yielded a parameterized volume formula for the convex hull of the graph of a trilinear monomial; however, existing results only address the case where all six bounds of the box domain are nonnegative. This restriction represents a notable gap in the literature, as variables with mixed-sign domains arise naturally in practice.

Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines."}

This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption.

This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM.

To derive our main results we establish two-sided bounds for divided differences, and in particular generalize Hunter's positivity theorem to a larger class of functions."}

In this work, we consider the detection of a planted matching, i.e., an independent edge set, hidden in an Erdős-Rényi random graph, which is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. We identify the critical regime for this testing problem and prove that the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically normal. Via analyses of computationally efficient edge or wedge count test statistics that attain the optimal limits of detection, our results also reveal the absence of a statistical-to-computational gap. Our main technical tool is the cluster expansion from statistical physics, which allows us to prove a precise, non-asymptotic characterization of the log-likelihood ratio. Our analyses rely on a careful reorganization and cancellation of terms that occur in the difference between monomer-dimer log partition functions on the complete and Erdős-Rényi graphs. This combinatorial and statistical physics approach represents a significant departure from the more established methods such as orthogonal decompositions, and positions the cluster expansion as a viable technique in the study of log-likelihood ratios for planted models in general."}

The FEEC framework preserves the geometric and topological structure of continuous spaces and PDEs in the discrete spaces and model, and helps build stable and convergent discretizations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, this structure is encoded in the de Rham complex. In this work, we consider the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation discretized within the FEEC framework. We model the effect of the unresolved scales on the finite-dimensional solution by introducing appropriate fine-scale governing equations, which we also discretize using the FEEC approach. This preserves the structure of the continuous problem in both the coarse- and fine-scale solutions; for instance, both the coarse- and fine-scale velocities are pointwise incompressible. We demonstrate that the resulting formulation is residual-based, energetically stable, and optimally convergent. Moreover, our fine-scale model provides an efficient computational approach: by decoupling fine-scale problems across elements, they can be solved in parallel. In fact, the fine-scale equations can be eliminated during matrix assembly, leading to a VMS formulation in which the problem size is governed solely by the coarse-scale discretization. Finally, the proposed formulation applies to both the lowest regularity discretizations of the de Rham complex and high-regularity isogeometric discretizations. We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, simulating both steady-, unsteady-, viscous-, and inviscid-flow problems. These tests show that the stabilized solutions are qualitatively better than the unstabilized ones, converge at optimal rates, and, as the mesh is refined, the stabilization is asymptotically turned off."}

The governing mechanical constraint is a nonlinear, non-smooth, and non-convex hemivariational inequality, which provides a more general and realistic description of frictional contact forces than standard variational inequalities, but is also more challenging due to its non-convexity. For energy-type shape functionals, the Eulerian derivative of the hemivariational inequality is derived through rigorous shape sensitivity analysis. The rationality of a regularization approach is justified by asymptotic analysis, and this method is further applied to handle the non-smoothness of general shape functionals in the sensitivity framework. Based on these theoretical results, a numerical boundary variational method is proposed for shape optimization. For topology optimization, three phase-field algorithms are developed: a gradient-flow phase-field method, a phase-field method with second-order regularization of the cost functional, and a phase-field method coupled with topological derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches are new for shape design in hemivariational inequalities. Various numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed shape and topology optimization algorithms."}

After conformal rescaling, it becomes a flow of coclosed $G_2$-structures, related to Grigorian's modified $G_2$ coflow, which is coupled to a flow for a dilaton function. Our main results establish fundamental short-time existence and Shi-type smoothing properties of this flow, as well as a classification of its fixed points. By a classical rigidity result in the string theory literature, the fixed points on a compact manifold correspond to torsion-free $G_2$-structures, that is, to metrics with holonomy contained in $G_2$. Thus, we establish in the affirmative a folklore question in the special holonomy community, about the existence of a well-posed flow for coclosed $G_2$-structures with fixed points given by torsion-free $G_2$-structures. The flow also satisfies a monotonicity formula for the $G_2$-dilaton functional (volume scale in string theory), which allows us to strengthen the rigidity result with an alternative proof. The monotonicity of the $G_2$-dilaton functional, combined with the Shi-type estimates, leads to a general result on the convergence of nonsingular solutions.

The associated resistance spectrum serves as a graph invariant and plays an important role in problems related to graph isomorphism. For an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the resistance distance $R_G(u,v)$ between two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ is defined as the effective resistance between them when each edge of $G$ is replaced by a $1\\,Ω$ resistor. The multiset of all resistance distances over unordered pairs of distinct vertices is called the \\emph{resistance spectrum} of $G$, denoted by $\\operatorname{RS}(G)$.

Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $Φ(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the \"quantized\" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols."}

Moreover, it is an essential ingredient in a new approach to linear regression via convex $M$-estimation, where the corresponding error densities are projected onto the log-concave class. Motivated by these applications, we study the minimax risk of score estimation with respect to squared $L^2(P_0)$-loss, where $P_0$ denotes an underlying log-concave distribution on $\\mathbb{R}$. Such distributions have decreasing score functions, but on its own, this shape constraint is insufficient to guarantee a finite minimax risk. We therefore define subclasses of log-concave densities that capture two fundamental aspects of the estimation problem. First, we establish the crucial impact of tail behaviour on score estimation by determining the minimax rate over a class of log-concave densities whose score function exhibits controlled growth relative to the quantile levels. Second, we explore the interplay between smoothness and log-concavity by considering the class of log-concave densities with a scale restriction and a $(β,L)$-Hölder assumption on the log-density for some $β\\in [1,2]$. We show that the minimax risk over this latter class is of order $L^{2/(2β+1)}n^{-β/(2β+1)}$ up to poly-logarithmic factors, where $n$ denotes the sample size. When $β< 2$, this rate is faster than could be obtained under either the shape constraint or the smoothness assumption alone. Our upper bounds are attained by a locally adaptive, multiscale estimator constructed from a uniform confidence band for the score function. This study highlights intriguing differences between the score estimation and density estimation problems over this shape-constrained class."}

Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice.

The probability that a replication study yields an effect with the same sign, or the same statistical significance as an original study depends on the sum of the variances of the effect estimates. On this basis, when P equals 0.025 one-sided and the replication study has the same sample size and variance as the original study, the probability of achieving a one-sided P is less than or equal to 0.025 a second time is only about 0.283, consistent with currently observed modest replication rates. A higher replication probability would require a larger sample size than that derived from current single variance power calculations. However, if the replication study is based on an infinitely large sample size and thus has negligible variance then the probability that its estimated mean is same sign is 1 - P = 0.975. The reasoning is made clearer by changing continuous distributions to discretised scales and probability masses, thus avoiding ambiguity and improper flat priors. This perspective is consistent with Frequentist and Bayesian interpretations and also requires further reasoning when testing scientific hypotheses and making decisions."}

It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories.

As an application of our theoretical analysis, we show that the approximated eigenvalues obtained by our method can be used to recover an unknown potential in a linear reaction-diffusion equation from discrete solution traces."}

Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.\n  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $β_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $β_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy."}

This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators."}

Applying these methods in practice can require discarding valuable data, unnecessarily reducing test power. We address this long-standing limitation by extending the theory of generalized U-statistics and applying it to the usual MMD estimator, resulting in new characterization of the asymptotic distributions of the MMD estimator with unequal sample sizes (particularly outside the proportional regimes required by previous partial results). This generalization also provides a new criterion for optimizing the power of an MMD test with unequal sample sizes. Our approach preserves all available data, enhancing test accuracy and applicability in realistic settings. Along the way, we give much cleaner characterizations of the variance of MMD estimators, revealing something that might be surprising to those in the area: while zero MMD implies a degenerate estimator, it is sometimes possible to have a degenerate estimator with nonzero MMD as well; we give a construction and a proof that it does not happen in common situations."}

For linear systems, a small reduced dimension directly translates into low computational cost, ensuring online efficiency. This property does not generally hold for nonlinear systems, where an additional approximation of nonlinear terms -- known as complexity reduction -- is required. To achieve online efficiency, empirical quadrature and cell-based empirical cubature are among the most effective complexity reduction techniques. However, existing offline training algorithms can be prohibitively expensive because they operate on raw snapshot data of all nonlinear integrands associated with the reduced model. In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing approach based on a specific structured compression of the training data. Its key feature is that it scales only with the number of collected snapshots, rather than additionally with the reduced model dimension. Overall, this yields roughly an order-of-magnitude reduction in offline computational cost and memory requirements, thereby enabling the application of the complexity reduction methods to larger-scale problems. Accuracy is preserved, as indicated by our error analysis and demonstrated through numerical examples."}

We identify the critical regime for this testing problem and prove that the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically normal. Via analyses of computationally efficient edge or wedge count test statistics that attain the optimal limits of detection, our results also reveal the absence of a statistical-to-computational gap. Our main technical tool is the cluster expansion from statistical physics, which allows us to prove a precise, non-asymptotic characterization of the log-likelihood ratio. Our analyses rely on a careful reorganization and cancellation of terms that occur in the difference between monomer-dimer log partition functions on the complete and Erdős-Rényi graphs.

We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis.

This viewpoint also explains several existing data-driven predictive control methods: regularized DeePC schemes act as soft versions of the innovation null-space constraint, instrumental-variable methods enforce it by construction, and ARX-based approaches explicitly estimate this innovation null space."}

The classical Sprague-Grundy Theory was developed for short impartial games, where players have a finite number of options, there are no special moves, and an infinite run is not possible. Subsequently, many generalizations have been proposed, particularly the Smith-Frankel-Perl Theory devised for games where the infinite run is possible, and the Larsson-Nowakowski-Santos Theory able to deal with entailing moves that disrupt the logic of the disjunctive sum. This work presents a generalization that combines these two theories, suitable for analyzing cyclic impartial games with carry-on moves, which are particular cases of entailing moves where the entailed player has no freedom of choice in their response.

In this work we develop a theoretical framework for surface tension driven hydraulic jumps in planar thin-film flows. Starting from the full interfacial stress conditions, we show that the deviatoric component of the normal stress enters at leading order and fundamentally alters the balance. A dominant-balance analysis in the zero-gravity limit yields parameter-free governing equations, which admit a similarity solution for the velocity profile. Depth-averaged momentum conservation then reveals a singularity at unit Weber number, interpreted as the criterion for hydraulic control.

Two estimation strategies namely rank-reduction and two-stage decomposition are developed to further reduce computational cost and improve scalability for larger systems. The proposed strategies yield ROMs with mean temperature-prediction errors within 5% of CFD simulations while reducing model-development times to O(10^0 s)-O(10^1 s).

The literature proposes various approaches for orbital debris remediation, including the use of multiple space-based lasers that collaboratively engage debris targets. While the proof of concept for this laser-based approach has been demonstrated, critical questions remain about its scalability and responsiveness as the debris population continues to expand rapidly. This paper introduces constellation reconfiguration as a system-level strategy to address these limitations. Through coordinated orbital maneuvers, laser-equipped satellites can dynamically adapt their positions to respond to evolving debris distributions and time-critical events. We formalize this concept as the Reconfigurable Laser-to-Debris Engagement Scheduling Problem (R-L2D-ESP), an optimization framework that determines the optimal sequence of constellation reconfigurations and laser engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity, which quantifies the constellation's ability to nudge, deorbit, or perform just-in-time collision avoidance maneuvers on debris objects. To manage the complexity of this combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a receding horizon approach. Our experiments reveal that reconfigurable constellations significantly outperform static ones, achieving greater debris remediation capacity and successfully deorbiting substantially more debris objects. Additionally, our sensitivity analyses identify the key parameters that influence remediation performance the most, providing essential insights for future system design. These findings demonstrate that constellation reconfiguration represents a promising advancement for laser-based debris removal systems, offering the adaptability and scalability necessary to enhance this particular approach to orbital debris remediation."}

Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (NMPCs) are suitable for this task, but struggle in time-critical scenarios requiring high frequency. To meet this demand, optimization problems are often simplified via linearization, narrowing the horizon window, or reduced temporal nodes, each compromising accuracy or reliability. This work presents the first general convex obstacle avoidance formulation, enabled by a novel approach to integrating logic. This facilitates the incorporation of an obstacle avoidance formulation into convex MPC schemes, enabling a convex optimization framework with substantially improved computational efficiency relative to conventional nonconvex methods. A key property of the formulation is that obstacle avoidance remains effective even when obstacles lie outside the prediction horizon, allowing shorter horizons for real-time deployment. In scenarios where nonconvex formulations are unavoidable, the proposed method meets or exceeds the performance of representative nonconvex alternatives. The method is evaluated in autonomous vehicle applications, where system dynamics are highly nonlinear."}

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws."}

Classic models such as the Moran process capture stochastic birth-death dynamics in structured populations, while reaction-diffusion equations like the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation describe deterministic wave-like spread. In this work, we bridge these perspectives by deriving partial differential equations for the spatiotemporal limit of Moran dynamics in continuous media. Our model incorporates two distinct fitness components: fecundity (birth rate) and viability (death rate). We demonstrate that the resulting selective wave speeds differ substantially in spatial Moran Birth-death (Bd), Moran Death-birth (Db), and FKPP dynamics. When fecundity drives the dynamics, we observe that the selective waves decelerate for the Bd process, whereas in the Db process the wave propagates with a higher, constant speed. In contrast, when viability drives the process, the Db wave accelerates, while the Bd and FKPP waves maintain comparable constant speeds. We extend the framework to heterogeneous media, represented as weighted lattice graphs in one or two dimensions. We derive a continuous space analog of isothermal graphs and establish that the isothermality condition corresponds to the conservation of a local current."}

Our main results establish fundamental short-time existence and Shi-type smoothing properties of this flow, as well as a classification of its fixed points. By a classical rigidity result in the string theory literature, the fixed points on a compact manifold correspond to torsion-free $G_2$-structures, that is, to metrics with holonomy contained in $G_2$. Thus, we establish in the affirmative a folklore question in the special holonomy community, about the existence of a well-posed flow for coclosed $G_2$-structures with fixed points given by torsion-free $G_2$-structures. The flow also satisfies a monotonicity formula for the $G_2$-dilaton functional (volume scale in string theory), which allows us to strengthen the rigidity result with an alternative proof. The monotonicity of the $G_2$-dilaton functional, combined with the Shi-type estimates, leads to a general result on the convergence of nonsingular solutions.

The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H>0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees\" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \\textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities.

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws."}

The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations.

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes."}

Leveraging the property of parabolic regularity for composite models, we show that the second-order subderivative of the cost function reduces to the novel second-order variational function playing a crucial role in the subsequent analysis. This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including the SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and the SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption.

STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms.

Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations."}

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings."}
