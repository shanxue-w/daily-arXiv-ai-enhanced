Unlike\nprevious work \\cite{BaldiT,BaldiT1,Toland,Toland1}, our formulation\naccommodates rotational flows in finite-depth water. We employ a conformal\nmapping technique to transform the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear\npseudodifferential equation, resulting in a periodic function of a single\nvariable. This reduction allows the existence question for such waves to be\naddressed within the framework of bifurcation theory. With the wavelength\nnormalized to 2$\\pi$, the problem features two free parameters: the wave speed\nand the constant vorticity. Under the assumption of the local convexity of\nundeformed membrane's stored energy, it is observed that the problem, when\nlinearized about uniform horizontal flow, has at most two independent solutions\nfor any values of the parameters. Fixing the vorticity and treating the wave\nspeed as the bifurcation parameter, the linearized problem possesses a single\nsolution. We demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem exhibits a sheet of\nsolutions comprising a family of curves bifurcating from simple eigenvalues.\nTaking both the wave speed and vorticity as parameters, when the constant\nvorticity approaches critical values, the linearized problem exhibits a\ntwo-dimensional kernel. Near these critical points, a secondary bifurcation\ncurve emerges from the primary solution branch. This secondary branch consists\nof ripple solutions on the surface."}

Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)\ninside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for\nsuccessful decoding.

For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear\nBoltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation.

Recently, Transformers have demonstrated\nremarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to\ntheir ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of\nTransformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.\nHowever, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the\nreliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose\nGPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable\nInterpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the\nperspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.\nThe global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable\nparameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable\nattention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm\nof SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer\nspecifically designed for accelerated MRI.

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical\nresults demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus\nallowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from\nagent-based simulations."}

To address the high cost of repeated forward and adjoint\nanalyses, we utilize a flow solver specifically optimized for high-resolution\nvoxel grids.

The microscopic model is governed by a coupled fluid-structure\ninteraction system: instationary Stokes equations for the fluid and linear\nelasticity for the solid, with two distinct scalings of the elastic stress\ntensor yielding different effective behaviors.\n  Using two-scale convergence techniques adapted to thin domains and\noscillatory microstructures, the membrane is reduced to an effective interface\nacross which transmission conditions are derived. The resulting macroscopic\nmodel couples the bulk fluid domains via effective interface laws of\nNavier-slip-type including the dynamic displacement. The character of this\ncoupling depends critically on the choice of the scaling in the elastic stress\ntensor, leading to either a membrane equation or a Kirchhoff-Love plate\nequation for the effective displacement.

The first such model is\nthe multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a ring, linked\nto the symmetric Macdonald polynomial $P_{\\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its\npartition function. Through this connection, a new formula was found for\n$P_{\\lambda}$ by generalizing multiline queues, which were introduced by Martin\nin 2018 to compute stationary probabilities of the ASEP. The second particle\nmodel is the multispecies totally asymmetric zero range process (TAZRP) on a\nring, which was very recently found to have an analogous connection to the\nmodified Macdonald polynomial $\\widetilde{H}_{\\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its\npartition function. This discovery coincided with a new formula for\n$\\widetilde{H}_{\\lambda}$, this time in terms of tableaux with a queue\ninversion statistic, which also compute stationary probabilities of the TAZRP.\nWe explain the plethystic relationship between multiline queues and queue\ninversion tableaux, and along the way, derive a new formula for $P_{\\lambda}$\nusing the queue inversion statistic. This plethystic correspondence is closely\nrelated to fusion in the setting of integrable systems."}

In this work, we explore the\ngeometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct\nclasses. First, we introduce and classify \\emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank\ncodes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending\nresults from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general\n\\emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero\ncodeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification\nremains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results\nfor this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD\n(Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from\npartitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three,\nwe connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the\nprojective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain\nfields."}
