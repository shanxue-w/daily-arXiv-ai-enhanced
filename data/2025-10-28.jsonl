By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes\nwith low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is\nthe minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array.

This critical scale\ndepends on the spatial dimension of the underlying random walk, specifically\n$\\psi_N = O(N^{3/4})$ when $d=1$, $\\psi_N = O( N/\\sqrt{\\log N})$ when $d=2$,\nand $\\psi_N = O(N)$ when $d\\ge 3$. In the particular case of centering the\nfluctuation window at the origin, our results recover and generalize some known\nfluctuation results for related models. However, farther from the origin, the\nprevious literature is more sparse. The noise coefficient in the limiting\nGaussian field is nontrivial and depends on the invariant measure of the\ntwo-point motion of the underlying RWRE model. We furthermore reconcile some of\nthese coefficient formulas with previous works.\n  As part of the proof, we introduce a general class of Markov chains with\nshort-range interactions that admit nice estimates and limit formulas. One of\nthe key technical results for such Markov chains is that in $d\\ge 2$, one can\npropagate test functions backwards in time to obtain precise limiting moment\nformulas."}

We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it\nensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby\nsimplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly\nfrom quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and\nnon-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,\nalthough not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor\nconstruction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,\nprovided they are sufficiently concentrated."}

As an application, we improve on\nthe best-known characterization of the metric entropy of the Sobolev ellipsoid,\nand extend Pinsker's Sobolev theorem in two ways: (i) to any bounded open\ndomain in arbitrary finite dimension, and (ii) by providing the second-order\nterm in the asymptotic expansion of the minimax risk."}

To overcome these challenges, this study\nproposes the Perturbation Function Iteration Method (PFIM), a novel framework\nbuilt upon perturbation theory. PFIM transforms nonlinear equations into\ntime-varying linear systems and solves their periodic responses via a piecewise\nconstant approximation scheme. Unlike HBM, PFIM avoids the trade-off between\nFourier truncation errors and the Gibbs phenomenon in non-smooth problems by\nemploying a basis-free iterative formulation, while significantly simplifying\nthe Jacobian computation. Extensive numerical studies, including self-excited\nsystems, parameter continuation, systems with varying smoothness, and\nhigh-dimensional finite element models, demonstrate that PFIM achieves\nquadratic convergence in smooth systems and maintains robust linear convergence\nin highly non-smooth cases. Moreover, comparative analyses show that, for\nhigh-dimensional non-smooth systems, PFIM attains solutions of comparable\naccuracy with computational costs up to two orders of magnitude lower than HBM.\nThese results indicate that PFIM provides a robust and efficient alternative\nfor periodic response analysis in complex nonlinear dynamical systems, with\nstrong potential for practical engineering applications."}

However, current electrolyzer-based hydrogen production processes\npredominantly rely on the single-scale Day-Ahead Market (DAM) for electricity\nprocurement, failing to fully exploit the economic benefits offered by\nmulti-scale electricity market that integrates both the DAM and the Real-Time\nMarket (RTM), thereby eliminating the opportunity to reduce the overall cost.\nTo mitigate this technical gap, this research investigates a dynamic\noperational strategy enabling electrolyzers to strategically navigate between\nthe DAM and RTM to minimize net operation costs. Using a rolling horizon\noptimization framework to coordinate bidding and operation, we demonstrate a\nstrategy where electrolyzers secure primary energy via exclusive DAM purchases,\nthen actively engage the RTM to buy supplemental energy cheaply or, critically,\nsell procured DAM energy back at a profit during high RTM price periods. Our\nanalysis reveals that this coordinated multi-scale electricity market\nparticipation strategy can dramatically reduce net electricity expenditures,\nachieving near-zero or even negative effective electricity costs for green\nhydrogen production under realistic market scenarios, effectively meaning the\noperation can profit from its electricity market interactions. By transforming\nelectrolyzers from simple price-takers into active participants capable of\narbitrage between market timescales, this approach unlocks a financially\ncompelling pathway for green hydrogen, accelerating its deployment while\nsimultaneously enhancing power grid flexibility."}

At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material\nacceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level\nconstraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a\nreaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal\ncontent of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus,\nGauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers\nEuler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle cannot select circulation\nor stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not\nthe instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the\nreaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The\nimpressed/reaction pressure decomposition can be supplemented with\northogonality conditions, allowing physical inputs (e.g. circulation,\nfreestream) to be embedded while maintaining exact constraint enforcement.

Numerical experiments compare the method to Monte Carlo and\nto other techniques such as antithetic variables and multilevel Monte Carlo\n(MLMC) across four contracts: European digital calls and puts, and Asian\ndigital calls and puts. Results show up to a 200-fold computational gain for\ndeep out-of-the-money cases while preserving unbiasedness. No evidence is found\nof prior applications of AMS to financial derivatives. The approach improves\npricing efficiency for rare-event contracts such as parametric insurance and\ncatastrophe linked securities. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided,\nsupporting multiple discretizations and importance functions."}

However, naively performing all computations in low\nprecision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed\nprecision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use\nlow-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their\nsuccess, these principles are currently not reliable for training\ncontinuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations\n(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for\nneural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation\nscheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.\nOur scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,\nparameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while\nstability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating\nthe solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two\nkey challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated\nnetwork evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of\ntime steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,\nopen-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading\npackages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the\nreliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on\nneural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,\nachieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training."}
