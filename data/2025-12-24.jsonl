The proposed framework ensures high order temporal accuracy through the use of Implicit Explicit Runge Kutta methods, which provide stability and efficiency in stiff regimes, while spatial resolution is enhanced by combining finite difference WENO reconstructions with high order central difference approximations. In the appropriate asymptotic limit, the scheme reduces to a high order finite difference formulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, thereby guaranteeing physical consistency of the numerical approximation with the limit model. To corroborate the theoretical findings, a set of numerical experiments is performed on two dimensional benchmark problems, which confirm the accuracy, stability, and versatility of the method across different flow regimes."}

The centers of WWs at a time step are defined by the solution of an auxiliary hybrid MC / deterministic problem formed by the low-order second-moment (LOSM) equations. The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs. Figure of merit and relative error results are presented, demonstrating the performance of the hybrid MC method and quantifying its computational efficiency."}

Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Ci. Sci. 2025], the authors studied the following natural question: find sufficient and necessary conditions for a domain $Ω$ in a metric space $X$ to be quasihyperbolic John. It was proved that Gromov hyperbolic John domains are quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. As an application, they obtained a characterization of uniform domains in Ahlfors regular spaces.\n  In a recent work, using a deep improved characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, Guo, Huang and Wang [arXiv 2025] proved the quantitative equivalence bteween inner uniformity and the quasihyperbolic John condition in metric doubling spaces. However, the proof does not yield a similar characterization for uniform domains. In this article, we find a new elementary approach to successfully extend the above characterization to uniform domains: a domain $Ω$ in a doubling length space $X$ is uniform if and only if it is linearly locally connected (LLC) and satisfies the ball separation condition, if and only if it is LLC-1 and quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. This substantially improved the corresponding results of Zhou and Ponnusamy.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond."}

Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL."}

However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to formulate a tight convex relaxation of the single-commodity FNC problem.

Rigorous a posteriori estimators exist for the global energy-norm error introduced by geometry simplifications.

This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments."}

We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_φ-α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $α$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $α$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\\infty} \\cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(ε,σ)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $σ\\in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations."}

The purpose of this note is to show that the recent reformulation of the NEC by McCann as variable lower timelike Ricci curvature bounds (arXiv:2304.14341) remains equivalent to the classical NEC not just for smooth but even for $C^2$-metrics, where McCann's original proof needs to be modified."}

Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization."}

When a wind turbine harvests energy from free wind, it produces a turbulent region with reduced energy for downstream turbines. Strategies for increasing the efficiency of wind farms by mitigating wake effects have been the subject of much computational research. To this end, both the positioning of the turbines and their cooperative control must be taken into account. Since they are mutually dependent, increasing attention has been paid to the joint consideration of layout design and control. However, joint modeling approaches lead to large-scale and difficult optimization problems, which lack efficient solution strategies. This paper describes an efficient optimization framework for the joint design and steady-state control of wind turbines under a continuous wake effect model. Through a multi-level reformulation of the joint optimization problem, it shows how problem sub-structure can be efficiently exploited to yield order-of-magnitude reduction in convergence times over naive approaches and prior proposals."}

Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain.

Deconvolution, on the other hand, is a fundamental and challenging problem in nonparametric statistics with the aim of estimating the distribution of a latent random variable $Z$ based on observations contaminated by some additive noise. The complexity of this task is heavily influenced by the smoothness of the noise distribution and often leads to slow estimation rates. In this paper, we combine the recent unlinked linear regression problem with the classical deconvolution framework. Specifically, we study nonparametric deconvolution under the assumption that $Z$ is a linear function of an observable multidimensional covariate. This structural constraint allows us to introduce a nonparametric estimator of the distribution of $Z$ which achieves the parametric convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance of order 1, and this independently of the smoothness of the noise distribution. Furthermore, and conditionally on an observed response, we consider the problem of estimating the value of the latent linear predictor, whose link to the observed response is not accessible. Through several simulations, we illustrate the fast convergence rate of our deconvolution estimator and the performance of the proposed conditional estimators of the latent predictor in different simulation scenarios."}

It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $δ(ζ)$ cannot satisfy both that \\(-δ(ζ)\\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \\((-\\infty,1)\\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method."}

This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas."}

This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization."}

This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."}

Most sparse generators control at most two of these features, and assortativity is often achieved by degree-preserving rewiring, which obscures the mechanism-parameter link. We introduce CoLaS (copula-seeded local latent-space graphs), a modular latent-variable model that separates marginal specifications from dependence. Each node has a popularity variable governing degree heterogeneity and a latent geometric location governing locality. A low-dimensional copula couples popularity and location, providing an interpretable dependence parameter that tunes degree mixing while leaving the chosen marginals unchanged. Under shrinking-range locality, edges are conditionally independent, the graph remains sparse, and clustering does not vanish. We develop sparse-limit theory for degrees, transitivity, and assortativity. Degrees converge to mixed-Poisson limits and we establish a degree-tail dichotomy: with fixed-range local kernels, degree tails are necessarily light, even under heavy-ailed popularity. To recover power-law degrees without sacrificing sparsity or locality, we propose CoLaS-HT, a minimal tail-inheriting extension in which effective connection ranges grow with popularity. Finally, under an identifiability condition, we provide a consistent one-graph calibration method based on jointly matching transitivity and assortativity."}

While bistable structures offer a promising pathway towards reusable energy absorbers, their functionality is almost universally constrained to a single loading axis, rendering them vulnerable and ineffective against off axis or oblique impacts. Here, we report the discovery and harnessing of eversion buckling, a distinct pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon in axisymmetric shells, to overcome this fundamental limitation. By strategically designing shell geometries to leverage this mechanism, we have engineered structural units with robust, inplane omnidirectional bistability. This property is characterized by a massive and rapid volumetric contraction upon snapping, which is key to its exceptional performance. When assembled, these structures exhibit an ideal, extended stress plateau, leading to a near perfect energy absorption efficiency dramatically outperforming typical energy absorbing materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system's damping capacity far exceeds its constituent material, and highly tunable, spanning a sixfold range of loss factors which enables load adaptive properties. This design strategy, elucidates a clear mechanism rooted in enhanced friction and sequential stress release, paving the way for a new class of robust, reusable, and load adaptive energy absorbing systems."}

Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery."}

Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime."}

For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.\n  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one."}

In contrast to the ideal gas setting, the non-ideal pressure law introduces stronger nonlinear effects and modifies the degeneracy structure near sonic states, which significantly complicates the analytical treatment of transonic flows. Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system. We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve. In addition, we investigate the regularity properties of the resulting sonic boundary. Our results extend the theory of supersonic sonic patches from polytropic gases to a realistic non-ideal gas model."}

Sectoral harmonics correspond to highest-weight vectors annihilated by the raising operator $L_+$; this annihilation condition reduces to a first-order differential equation admitting solutions for any real $m > 0$, independent of representation-theoretic constraints. Tesseral harmonics arise from the full ladder algebra acting on highest-weight states; for non-integer $m$, this construction yields tesseral modes at $ν= m + k$ for positive integer $k$, with the hypergeometric series terminating when $ν- m$ is a non-negative integer. Zonal harmonics with $m = 0$ require integer $ν$ on the full sphere, but TE-polarised zonal modes survive in wedge geometries because their electric field components automatically satisfy the conducting boundary conditions.

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications."}

Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science."}

To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds."}

For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$.

A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $ρ(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated\" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest. In particular we obtain upper bounds on the supremum norm of Mercer eigenfunctions of several reproducing kernels (including several Matérn kernels) which are of independent interest."}

The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \\cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \\cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing."}

For given integer $n\\ge 2$, we condition the tree on the following $n$-arm event: we pick $n$ branches, emanating from $n$ points microscopically close to a given interior point, and condition them to connect to the boundary $\\partial Ω$ without intersecting. What can be said about the geometry of these branches?\n  We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity.\n  We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $Ω$ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$β$E with $β=1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $β= 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with $κ=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting.\n  Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\\ge 2$ of curves. In contrast, the variance of the the winding of the curves behaves as $κ/n^2$, which agrees with the predictions from the physics literature made by Wieland and Wilson numerically, and by Duplantier and Binder using Coulomb gas methods -- but disagrees with a result of Kenyon."}

Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \\cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \\cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Adjusting for (baseline) covariates with working regression models becomes standard practice in the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT). When the dimension $p$ of the covariates is large relative to the sample size $n$, specifically $p = o (n)$, adjusting for covariates even in a linear working model by ordinary least squares can yield overly large bias, defeating the purpose of improving efficiency. This issue arises when no structural assumptions are imposed on the outcome model, a scenario that we refer to as the assumption-lean setting. Several new estimators have been proposed to address this issue. However, they focus mainly on simple randomization under the finite-population model, not covering covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) schemes under the superpopulation model. Due to improved covariate balance between treatment groups, CAR is more widely adopted in RCT; and the superpopulation model fits better when subjects are enrolled sequentially or when generalizing to a larger population is of interest. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop procedures in these settings, as the current regulatory guidance provides little concrete direction. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that an adjusted estimator based on second-order $U$-statistics can almost unbiasedly estimate the average treatment effect and enjoy a guaranteed efficiency gain if $p = o (n)$. In our analysis, we generalize the coupling technique commonly used in the CAR literature to $U$-statistics and also obtain several useful results for analyzing inverse sample Gram matrices by a delicate leave-$m$-out analysis, which may be of independent interest. Both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of our new estimator compared to popular benchmarks."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."}

The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.\n  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows.

When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$."}

Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence."}

What can be said about the geometry of these branches?\n  We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity.\n  We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $Ω$ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$β$E with $β=1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $β= 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with $κ=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting.\n  Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\\ge 2$ of curves.

Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds."}

In most situations, the coordinates are asymptotically independent; however, there are notable exceptions for the meander case, depending on the drift.

To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines."}

Here $g$ captures general convex objectives and indicator functions for convex constraints, while the composite template simultaneously models convex penalties on smooth features $(h \\circ C)$ and smooth couplings of convex (possibly nonsmooth) features $(s \\circ R)$. Each prox-convex step forms a convex subproblem by linearizing only the smooth maps while preserving the existing convex structure. The resulting subproblem is made strongly convex with the proximal metric $Q_k=μ_k I+H_k^+ \\succ 0$ where $μ_k$ is adapted using an implicit trust-region strategy, and $H_k^+ \\succeq 0$ is an optional curvature term for local acceleration.

Furthermore, a local error-bound condition for $F$ guarantees a metric step-size error bound and hence local $Q$-linear convergence of the function values. Using the Taylor-like model framework of Drusvyatskiy, Ioffe, and Lewis, we show that every cluster point of the iterates is limiting-stationary; under our regularity conditions, this further implies Fréchet stationarity.

These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function.

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies.

We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective.

The framework highlights the coupling between material anisotropy and active deformations, with target curvatures that compete with imposed geometric constraints. To demonstrate its capabilities, we apply the model to curvature-induced cell alignment, where substrate geometry, cytoskeletal anisotropy, and contractility interact to determine orientation. For cylindrical substrates, the model predicts a supercritical bifurcation in preferred orientation, from perpendicular to parallel, through an oblique orientation governed by the ratio of active contractility to substrate curvature and modulated by material stiffness. For ellipsoidal geometries, we capture stable parallel, perpendicular, and oblique configurations depending on principal curvatures, whereas spherical substrates do not show preferred alignments. These predictions qualitatively reproduce experimental observations across cell types, explaining divergent behaviors between contractile epithelial cells and stiffer fibroblasts in a rigorous context. Beyond cellular mechanics, this framework applies broadly to thin fiber-reinforced active structures in soft robotics, morphogenesis, and tissue engineering."}

A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of RNA. Chord diagrams are mathematical objects widely used to represent RNA secondary structures and to analyze structural motifs, however a mathematically rigorous enumeration of pseudoknots remains a challenge. We introduce a method that incorporates a distance-based metric $τ$ to analyze the intersection graph of a chord diagram associated with a pseudoknotted structure. In particular, our method formally defines a pseudoknot in terms of a weighted vertex cover of a certain intersection graph constructed from a partition of the chord diagram representing the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule. In this graph-theoretic context, we introduce a rigorous algorithm that enumerates pseudoknots, classifies secondary structures, and is sensitive to three-dimensional topological features. We implement our methods in MATLAB and test the algorithm on pseudoknotted structures from the bpRNA-1m database. Our findings confirm that genus is a robust quantifier of pseudoknot complexity."}

To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder.

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%).

Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their \"contact rates\" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model.

Furthermore, in the multi-critical case where the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{5/3}$, the limiting kernel is built from the second member of the Boussinesq hierarchy. We derive the results by transforming the random matrix model into biorthogonal ensembles that are analogous to the Muttalib-Borodin ensemble, and then analyzing its asymptotic behavior via a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem."}

PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality.

After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification.

In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization."}

The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-Newtonian stress, for a general constitutive model. For weakly non-Newtonian fluids, a regular perturbation expansion combined with the method of characteristics yields all leading-order stress contributions from the Newtonian velocity field alone, avoiding the need to solve coupled partial differential equations. This generalizes the method of Koch et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 013301 (2016)) beyond polymeric fluids to any weakly non-Newtonian medium driven by velocity and its gradients. We apply the method to two systems: (i) spheres suspended in a fluid of smaller spheroids, where the interaction stress becomes negative for sufficiently anisotropic shapes due to orientation misalignment of the spheroids; and (ii) suspensions in weakly anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. In the latter, assuming a uniform director field fixed by an external field, PINNS vanishes while interaction stresslets remain, either opposing or enhancing background anisotropic stress. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in capturing first-order particle-microstructure interactions across a broad class of non-Newtonian fluids."}

Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective."}

The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons.

If $Ω$ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$β$E with $β=1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $β= 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with $κ=2$).

Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates.

Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $Θ(d_A d_B r)$."}
