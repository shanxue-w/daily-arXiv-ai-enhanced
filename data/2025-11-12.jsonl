The method combines neural networks with reduced-order modeling and physics-informed training to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. In the offline stage, reduced basis functions are obtained via nonlinear dimension reduction, and a neural surrogate is trained to map parameters to approximate solutions. The surrogate employs a nonlinear reconstruction of the solution from the basis functions, enabling more accurate representation of complex solution structures than linear mappings. The model is further refined during the online stage using lightweight physics-informed neural network training. This offline-online framework enables accurate prediction especially in complex scenarios or with limited snapshot data. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments."}

However, its convergence heavily depends on the choice of initial approximations. This paper introduces two novel approaches for determining the initial values: New bound 1 and the lambda maximal bound, aimed at improving the stability and convergence speed of the algorithm. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these bounds. The lambda maximal bound consistently ensures that all the roots lie within the complex circle, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Comparative results demonstrate that while New bound 1 guarantees convergence, but it yields excessively large radii."}

Transferring such equilibria from the GS discretization to the MHD discretization often introduces errors that lead to unwanted perturbations to the equilibria on the level of the MHD discretization. In this work, we identify and analyze sources of such errors in the context of finite element methods, with a focus on the force balance and divergence-free properties of the loaded equilibria. In particular, we reveal three main sources of errors: (1) the improper choice of finite element spaces in the MHD scheme relative to the poloidal flux and toroidal field function spaces in the GS scheme, (2) the misalignment of the meshes from two solvers, and (3) possibly under-resolved strong gradients near the separatrix. With this in mind, we study the impact of different choices of finite element spaces, including those based on compatible finite elements. In addition, we also investigate the impact of mesh misalignment and propose to conduct mesh refinement to resolve the strong gradients near the separatrix. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate equilibria errors arising in the transferred initial conditions. Results show that force balance is best preserved when structure-preserving finite element spaces are used and when the MHD and GS meshes are both aligned and refined. Given that the poloidal flux is often computed in continuous Galerkin spaces, we further demonstrate that projecting the magnetic field into divergence-conforming spaces is optimal for preserving force balance, while projection into curl-conforming spaces, although less optimal for force balance, weakly preserves the divergence-free property."}

The matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ will be sparse when the PDE is discretized directly, and dense when an integral equation formulation is used. In either case, industry practice for large scale problems has for decades been to use iterative solvers such as multigrid, GMRES, or conjugate gradients. A direct solver, in contrast, builds an approximation to the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{A}$, or alternatively, an easily invertible factorization (e.g. LU or Cholesky).

The simplicity of our model allows us to succinctly illustrate various phenomena of geometric and analytic significance tied to shocks, which we view as a prototype for phenomena that can occur in more general quasilinear hyperbolic PDE solutions.\n  Our Cauchy problem admits a classical solution that blows up in finite time. The classical solution is defined in a largest possible globally hyperbolic region called a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD), and its properties are tied to the intrinsic Lorentzian geometry of the equation and solution. The boundary of the MGHD contains an initial singularity, a singular boundary along which the solution's second derivatives blow up (the solution and its first derivatives remain bounded), and a Cauchy horizon. Our main results provide the first example of a provably unique MGHD for a shock-forming quasilinear wave equation solution; it is provably unique because its boundary has a favorable global structure that we precisely describe.\n  We also prove that for the same $C^{\\infty}$ initial data, the Cauchy problem admits a second kind of solution: a unique global weak entropy solution that has a shock curve separating two smooth regions. Of particular interest is our proof that the classical and weak solutions agree before the shock but differ in a region to the future of the first singularity where both solutions are defined."}

The problem involves defining routes for transportation requests with specific pickup and delivery locations using a heterogeneous vehicle fleet, while machines must be scheduled to traverse certain edges. The objective is to minimize the total completion time subject to capacity, time window, and precedence constraints. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulation, including preprocessing and valid inequalities, and a multi-start heuristic with a linear programming (LP) improvement procedure. A benchmark set with two instance families is also introduced: (i) coordination of pickups and deliveries across islands requiring cargo ships, and (ii) transport across multiple floors, as in hospitals, requiring elevator scheduling. Computational experiments show that the solver on the MIP formulation solves instances with up to 12 requests and finds feasible solutions for 95.0% of the 320 instances with up to 12 requests. For these, the heuristic consistently provides feasible solutions with low deviations, often matching or outperforming the MIP results. For the remaining 160 instances with 40 and 60 requests, only the heuristic finds feasible solutions. We thus recommend the MIP for short-horizon instances (up to 12 requests) and the heuristic for larger or long-horizon instances. Results also highlight the LP improvement procedure's relevance, reducing solution values by at least 5% on average in general. For larger, tightly constrained instances, an additional machine helps with feasibility and solution quality."}

To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding."}

While robust point estimation in this setting is well understood, statistical inference remains challenging, especially because the contamination proportion is not identifiable from the data. We develop a new algorithm that constructs confidence intervals for individual regression coefficients without any prior knowledge of the contamination level. Our method is based on a Z-estimation framework using a smooth estimating function. The method directly quantifies the uncertainty of the estimating equation after a preprocessing step that decorrelates covariates associated with the nuisance parameters. We show that the resulting confidence interval has valid coverage uniformly over all contamination distributions and attains an optimal length of order $O(1/\\sqrt{n(1-ε)^2})$, matching the rate achievable when the contamination proportion $ε$ is known. This result stands in sharp contrast to the adaptation cost of robust interval estimation observed in the simpler Gaussian location model."}

An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.\n  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.\n  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.\n  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D.

Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales."}

In this paper, we instead explicitly calculate the metric projection of the unit constant function onto a shift-invariant subspace of the Hardy space $H^p$ when $1<p<\\infty$. This problem is equivalent to finding the best approximation in $H^p$ of the conjugate of an inner function.

This paper develops a lossless convexification framework for the fuel-optimal control of linear systems with discrete-valued inputs. We extend existing Mayer-form results by showing that, under simple geometric conditions, system normality is preserved when reformulating Lagrange-form problems into Mayer-form. Furthermore, we derive explicit algebraic conditions for normality in systems with cross-polytopic input sets. Leveraging these results and an extreme-point relaxation, we demonstrate that the fuel-optimal control problem admits a lossless convexification, enabling real-time, discrete-valued solutions without resorting to mixed-integer optimization.

Under some natural conditions, these dimensions turn out to be the minimum and maximum of the corresponding dimensions of the cookie-cutter sets generated by the individual expanding maps. In the case of one-parameter families of such systems, this provides a simple mechanism for producing non-differentiable fractal dimensions as functions of the parameter. This supports a conjecture that the Hausdorff dimension of the spectrum of a Sturmian Hamiltonian, in general, does not have to be differentiable as a function of the coupling constant. This is in drastic contrast to the analytic dependence of the dimensions of such spectra with quadratic irrational frequencies, e.g. the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, previously shown by M. Pollicott."}

While the case of imaging data obtained from a single study condition has already been intensively studied, confidence statements about the intersection, or union, of the excursion sets derived from different subject conditions have only been introduced recently. Such methods aim to model the images from different study conditions as asymptotically Gaussian random processes with differentiable sample paths.\n  In this work, we remove the restricting condition of differentiability and only require continuity of the sample paths. This allows for a wider range of applications including many settings which cannot be treated with the existing theory. To achieve this, we introduce a novel notion of convergence on piecewise continuous functions over finite partitions. This notion is of interest in its own right, as it implies convergence results for maxima of sequences of piecewise continuous functions over sequences of sets. Generalizing well-known results such as the extended continuous mapping theorem, this novel convergence notion also allows us to construct for the first time confidence regions for mathematically challenging examples such as symmetric differences of excursion sets."}

We give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions of these equations, and work through a long list of examples in which these assumptions are satisfied. This work is meant to accomplish three goals: complement and unite earlier assumptions and arguments focused more on the Hamilton-Jacobi type structure; import ideas from nonlocal elliptic integro-differential equations; and argue that nearly all of the operators in this family enjoy a common structure of being a monotone function of the differences of the unknown, plus ``lower order'' terms. This last goal is tied to the fact that most of the examples in this family can be proven to have a Bellman-Isaacs representation as a min-max of linear operators with a graph Laplacian structure."}

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems."}

In this paper we show how such examples can be constructed for all but a countable number of angles. We also investigate the conditions for when the sides and bottom of a self-overlapping symmetric binary tree differ from what happens with self-avoiding and self-contacting trees."}

A", "summary": "The bulk-boundary correspondence, one of the most significant features of topological matter, theoretically connects the existence of edge modes at the boundary with topological invariants of the bulk spectral bands. However, it remains unspecified in realistic examples how large the size of a lattice should be for the correspondence to take effect. In this work, we employ the diatomic chain model to introduce an analytical framework to characterize the dependence of edge states on the lattice size and boundary conditions. In particular, we apply asymptotic estimates to examine the bulk-boundary correspondence in long diatomic chains as well as reveal the finite-size regimes where it fails. Moreover, under our framework the eigenfrequencies near the band edges can be well approximated where two special patterns are detected. These estimates on edge states and eigenfrequencies in linear diatomic chains can be further extended to nonlinear chains to investigate the emergence of new nonlinear edge states and other nonlinear localized states. In addition to one-dimensional diatomic chains, examples of more complicated and higher-dimensional lattices are provided to show the universality of our analytical framework."}

We introduce a novel theoretical perspective on the asymptotic properties of regression adjustment through a Neumann-series decomposition, yielding a systematic higher-degree corrections and a refined analysis of regression adjustment.

Thus, retrieving the $k$ largest/smallest elements from a low-rank tensor is a fundamental and important task in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we first model the top-$k$ elements retrieval problem to a continuous constrained optimization problem. To address the equivalent optimization problem, we develop a block-alternating iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into a sequence of small-scale subproblems. Leveraging the separable summation structure of the objective function, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve these subproblems in an alternating manner.

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces.

In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold."}

This paper proposes a feedback stabilization strategy based on a reduced quantum filter that achieves robustness against time-varying Hamiltonian perturbations and additional dissipative effects, without requiring prior knowledge of the initial state or exact system parameters. The proposed filter estimates only O(N) real variables corresponding to the diagonal elements of the system density matrix in a quantum non-demolition basis in contrast to the O(N^2) variables required by a full stochastic master equation, where N is the Hilbert space dimension. This dimensionality reduction substantially simplifies real-time computation and feedback implementation while preserving both convergence and robustness guarantees. Rigorous analysis further establishes global exponential stability of the target subspace. The results provide a scalable framework for robust and efficient measurement-based feedback control applicable to high-dimensional perturbed open quantum systems."}

We obtain two sets of results, corresponding to two natural notions of reconstruction.\n  - {\\bf Reconstruction in Wasserstein distance:} We give essentially matching upper and lower bounds on the cutoff frequency $T$ and the magnitude $κ$ of the noise for which accurate reconstruction in Wasserstein distance is possible.

Here too we give essentially matching upper and lower bounds on the cutoff frequency $T$ and the magnitude $κ$ of the noise for which accurate reconstruction is possible.

In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach.

Mixed products (e.g., Cohen with Random) fit naturally by stability of pushforwards and restrictions, and the framework separates weak choice principles (e.g., failure of the Partition Principle alongside $DC$ or $DC_{<κ}$).\n  We extend the analysis to singular $κ$. When cf($κ$) = $ω$ we provide complete proofs using block-partition stabilizers and trees of conditions. For arbitrary singular $κ$ we introduce game-guided fusion of length cf($κ$) and a tree-fusion master condition, establishing singular-limit completeness, preservation of $DC_{< κ}$, no collapse of $κ$, and no new bounded subsets of $κ$. The resulting toolkit offers reusable patterns for constructing choiceless inner models with targeted fragments of dependent choice."}

This hierarchical mixture approach provides a unified modeling framework that not only constructs a new class of asymmetric space-time covariance functions with closed-form expressions, but also provides corresponding space-time process representations, which further unify constructions for many existing space-time covariance models. This hierarchical mixture framework decomposes the complexity of model specification at different levels of hierarchy, for which parsimonious covariance models can be specified with simple mixing measures to yield flexible properties and closed-form derivation. A characterization theorem is provided for the hierarchical mixture approach on how the mixing measures determine the statistical properties of covariance functions. Several new covariance models resulting from this hierarchical mixture approach are discussed in terms of their practical usefulness. A theorem is also provided to construct a general class of valid asymmetric space-time covariance functions with arbitrary and possibly different degrees of smoothness in space and in time and flexible long-range dependence. The proposed covariance class also bridges a theoretical gap in using the Lagrangian reference framework. The superior performance of several new parsimonious covariance models over existing models is verified with the well-known Irish wind data and the U.S. air temperature data."}

First, using the relative entropy method together with the framework of $a$-contraction with shifts, we derive energy estimates for the weighted relative entropy of perturbations. We then successively obtain high-order and dissipation estimates via direct energy arguments, which provide the required a priori bounds. Combining these estimates with a local existence result, we establish the global asymptotic stability of the shifted planar viscous shock wave. Finally, we show that as the relaxation parameter tends to zero, solutions of the relaxed system converge globally in time to those of the classical Navier-Stokes system."}

We validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model by contrasting the coverage probability obtained from our analysis with that estimated from a Starlink constellation.

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

Our approach is based on local histopolation methods defined through unisolvent triples, where the edge weights are induced by probability densities. We present a general strategy that applies to arbitrary polynomial order~$k$, in which edge moments are taken against orthogonal polynomials associated with the chosen densities. This yields a systematic framework for weighted reconstructions of any degree, with theoretical guarantees of unisolvency and fully explicit basis functions. As a concrete and flexible instance, we introduce a two-parameter family of Jacobi-type distributions on $[-1,1]$, together with its symmetric Gegenbauer subclass, and show how these densities generate new quadratic reconstruction operators that generalize the standard linear histopolation scheme while preserving its simplicity and locality. We employ an adaptive parameter selection algorithm for Jacobi densities, which automatically tunes the distribution parameters to minimize the global reconstruction error. This strategy enhances robustness and adaptivity across different function classes and mesh resolutions. The effectiveness of the proposed operators is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, which confirm their superior accuracy in approximating both smooth and highly oscillatory functions. Finally, the framework is sufficiently general to accommodate any admissible edge density, thus providing a flexible and broadly applicable tool for weighted function reconstruction."}

One of our main results states that extensional ESO has the same computational power as hereditary first-order logic. We also characterize the computational power of the fragment of extensional ESO with monotone universal first-order part in terms of finitely bounded CSPs.

For this problem, we develop efficiency bounds and efficient estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with the efficiency bound. In the analysis, we introduce two different data-generating processes: the one-sample setting and the two-sample setting. The one-sample setting considers the case where we can observe treatment indicators and outcomes for a part of the dataset, which is also called the censoring setting. In contrast, the two-sample setting considers two independent datasets with labeled and unlabeled data, which is also called the case-control setting or the stratified setting. In both settings, we find that by incorporating auxiliary covariates, we can lower the efficiency bound and obtain an estimator with an asymptotic variance smaller than that without such auxiliary covariates."}

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

The open-source DG framework FLEXI has recently been extended to support DG schemes on general polytopal elements including tetrahedra, prisms, and pyramids. This advancement enables simulations on complex geometries where purely hexahedral meshes are difficult or impossible to generate. However, the use of meshes with heterogeneous element types introduces a workload imbalance, a consequence of the temporal evolution of modal rather than nodal degrees of freedom and the accompanying transformations. In this work, we present a lightweight, system-agnostic in-memory load balancing strategy designed for high-order DG solvers. The method employs high-precision runtime measurements and efficient data redistribution to dynamically reassign mesh elements along a space-filling curve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and large-scale parallel runs on the EuroHPC pre-exascale system MareNostrum 5.

Heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for many real-world systems largely because it resists many concentration arguments.

We show that, under a mild assumption of uniform ergodicity, a natural finite-horizon LP-update policy with randomized rounding, that was originally proposed for the homogeneous case, achieves an $O(\\log N\\sqrt{1/N})$ optimality gap in infinite time average reward problems for fully heterogeneous RMABs. In doing so, we show results that provide strong theoretical guarantees on a well-known algorithm that works very well in practice. The LP-update policy is a model predictive approach that computes a decision at time $t$ by planing over a time-horizon $\\{t\\dots t+τ\\}$. Our simulation section demonstrates that our algorithm works extremely well even when $τ$ is very small and set to $5$, which makes it computationally efficient. Our theoretical results draw on techniques from the model predictive control literature by invoking the concept of \\emph{dissipativity} and generalize quite easily to the more general weakly coupled heterogeneous Markov Decision Process setting. In addition, we draw a parallel between our own policy and the LP-index policy by showing that the LP-index policy corresponds to $τ=1$. We describe where the latter's shortcomings arise from and how under our mild assumption we are able to address these shortcomings. The proof of our main theorem answers an open problem posed by (Brown et al 2020), paving the way for several new questions on the LP-update policies."}

However, such an approach is prone to suffer from order reduction, especially in the presence of inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, we extend an approach of Einkemmer and Ostermann [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 37, A1577-A1592, 2015] to advection-diffusion-reaction problems, where the advection and reaction terms depend nonlinearly on both the solution and its gradient. Starting from a modified splitting method, we construct a predictor-corrector scheme that avoids order reduction and significantly improves accuracy. The predictor only requires the solution of a linear diffusion equation, while the corrector is simply an explicit Euler step of an advection-reaction equation. Under appropriate regularity assumptions on the exact solution, we rigorously establish second-order convergence for this scheme. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical results."}

For that purpose, we need some regularity results for our solutions. In this direction, we first prove the existence of weak solutions to \\eqref{p1} via the mountain pass technique.

Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes.

The resulting MV singular dividend control problem is time-inconsistent, and we follow a game-theoretic approach to find a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. Our main contribution is a new verification theorem for the novel dividend problem, in which the MV criterion is applied to an integral of the control until ruin, a random time that is endogenous to the problem.

The proposed framework exhibits substantial advancements in predictive accuracy and generalization, adeptly tackling the multifaceted challenges of robust classification across diverse domains, including credit risk evaluation, anomaly detection in IoT ecosystems, early-stage medical diagnostics, and high-dimensional biological data analysis. To overcome the limitations of conventional Random Forests, we present an approach that places stronger emphasis on capturing the most relevant signals from data while enabling adaptive hyperparameter configuration. The model is guided towards features that contribute more meaningfully to classification and optimizing this with dynamic parameter tuning. The results demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements and meaningful insights into feature relevance, showcasing the efficacy of combining importance aware sampling and metaheuristic optimization."}

To tackle infeasible QPs, slack variables are often introduced to ensure feasibility, which changes the structure of the problem, increases its size, and slows down numerical resolution. In this letter, we propose a simple ADMM scheme to tackle QPs with slack variables without increasing the size of the original problem. The only modification is a slightly different projection in the z-update, while the rest of the algorithm remains standard. We prove that the method is equivalent to applying ADMM to the QP with additional slack variables, even though slack variables are not added. Numerical experiments show speedups of the approach."}

While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes."}

The potential is introduced taking advantage of the fact that the nonlinear Dirac equation admits a Lagrangian formalism. As a consequence, the imaginary part of the potential, associated with gains and losses, behaves as a spatially periodic damping (changing from positive to negative, and back) that acts at the same time on the two spinor components. A collective coordinates theory is developed by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, momentum, frequency, and phase are all functions of time. We consider the complex potential as a perturbation and verify that numerical solutions of the equation of motions for the collective coordinates are in agreement with simulations of the nonlinear Dirac equation. The main effect of the imaginary part of the potencial is to induce oscillations in the charge and energy (they are conserved for real potentials) with the same frequency and phase as the momentum. We find long-lived solitons even with very large charge and energy oscillations. Additionally, we extend to the nonlinear Dirac equation an empirical stability criterion, previously employed successfully in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation."}

Service rate attains values in a compact set and there is a cost associated with each service rate. Under these assumptions, our objective is to characterize the service rate policy that maximizes the infinite-horizon discounted reward and the long-run average reward. We show that for systems with an infinite buffer, the optimal service rate policy is monotone. However, the optimal policy is not necessarily monotone when capacity is finite. Furthermore, we prove that the set of possible optimal actions can be reduced to the lower boundary of the convex hull of the action space and develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm.

The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects.

In the case of the interior function, we exactly prescribe an integral constraint which is necessary to obtain a unique solution given the arbitrary constant solution associated with Neumann boundary conditions. Our implementation is based on a fast integral method for the regular part of the Green's function which allows for a rapid and high order discretization for general domains. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method for simple geometries such as disks and ellipses where closed form solutions are available.

The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond."}

Cash transfer (CT) programmes are considered one of the main social protection strategies and an instrument for achieving SDG 1. Targeting consists of establishing eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of CT programmes. In low-income countries, where resources are limited, proper targeting of CTs is essential for an efficient use of resources. Given the growing importance of microinsurance as a complementary tool to social protection strategies, this study examines its role as a supplement to CT programmes. In this article, we adopt the piecewise-deterministic Markov process introduced in Kovacevic and Pflug (2011) to model the capital of a household, which when exposed to large proportional capital losses (in contrast to the classical Cramér-Lundberg model) can push them into the poverty area. Striving for cost-effective CT programmes, we optimise the expected discounted cost of keeping the household's capital above the poverty line by means of injection of capital (as a direct capital transfer). Using dynamic programming techniques, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the optimal control problem of determining the amount of capital to inject over time. We show that this equation admits a viscosity solution that can be approximated numerically. Moreover, in certain special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the solution. Numerical examples show that there is an optimal level of injection above the poverty threshold, suggesting that efficient use of resources is achieved when CTs are preventive rather than reactive, since injecting capital into households when their capital levels are above the poverty line is less costly than to do so only when it falls below the threshold."}

We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit.

To evaluate and optimize IT drug delivery, it is necessary to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). In combination with experimental measurements, computational modeling plays an important role in reconstructing CSF flow in the CNS. Existing models have provided valuable insights into the CSF dynamics; however, most neglect the effects of tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on measured CSF flow rates under specific conditions, leaving full-CNS CSF flow field predictions across different physiological states underexplored. Here, we propose a comprehensive multiphysics computational model of the CNS with three key features: (1) it is implemented on a fully closed geometry of CNS; (2) it includes the interaction between CSF and poroelastic tissue as well as the compliant spinal dura mater; (3) it has potential for predictive simulations because it only needs data on cardiac blood pulsation into the brain. Our simulations under physiological conditions demonstrate that our model accurately reconstructs the CSF pulsation and captures both the craniocaudal attenuation and phase shift of CSF flow along the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). When applied to the simulation of IT drug delivery, our model successfully captures the intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation during injection and subsequent recovery after injections. The proposed multiphysics model provides a unified and extensible framework that allows parametric studies of CSF flow dynamics and optimization of IT injections, serving as a strong foundation for integration of additional physiological mechanisms."}

This method utilizes a transformation into the Lagrange coordinates that splits the equations and allows one to solve the chromatographic one-phase problem separately. The solution is then substituted into a scalar hyperbolic conservation law, which is solved using the method of characteristics. However, there is often a gap in the characteristics near the chemical shock front. It was posited to the authors that the Jouguet principle could be used to close that gap. However, no rigorous justification was given for this approach, and as such it remained a heuristic. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of the gap and its properties, and give a proper argumentation for the Jouguet heuristic and its applicability based on the Kružkov-type uniqueness theorem for the conservation law system. Additionally, a second splitting technique within the Lagrange coordinates is developed that simplifies this analysis and the construction of characteristics.\n  Keywords: Enhanced oil recovery, Polymer flooding, Slug injection, Conservation laws, Hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations"}

Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one.

NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation.

This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations."}

The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density.

LCAs capture hierarchical relationships in rooted trees and, more generally, in DAGs. In 1981, Aho et al. introduced the problem of determining whether a set of pairwise LCA constraints on a set $X$, of the form $(i,j)<(k,l)$ with $i,j,k,l\\in X$, can be realized by a rooted tree whose leaf set is $X$, such that whenever $(i,j)<(k,l)$, the LCA of $i,j$ is a descendant of that of $k,l$. They also presented a polynomial-time algorithm, BUILD, to solve this problem. However, many such constraint systems cannot be realized by any tree, prompting the question of whether they can be realized by a more general DAG. We extend Aho et al.'s framework from trees to DAGs, providing both theoretical and algorithmic foundations for reasoning about LCA constraints in this broader setting. Given a collection $R$ of LCA constraints, we define its $+$-closure $R^+$, capturing additional LCA relations implied by $R$. Using $R^+$, we construct a canonical DAG $G_R$ and prove that $R$ is DAG-realizable if and only if it is realized by $G_R$. We further adapt this construction to phylogenetic networks, defining a canonical network $N_R$ and prove that it is regular, i.e., it coincides with the Hasse diagram of its underlying set system. Finally, we show that for any DAG-realizable $R$, its classical closure - comprising all LCA constraints that hold in every DAG realizing $R$ - coincides with its $+$-closure. All constructions are computable in polynomial time, and we provide explicit algorithms for each."}

It is known that a monotone class defined by finitely many obstructions has bounded treewidth if and only if one of the obstructions is a so-called tripod, that is, a disjoint union of trees with exactly one vertex of degree 3 and paths. This dichotomy also characterizes exactly those monotone graph classes for which many NP-hard algorithmic problems admit polynomial-time algorithms. These algorithmic dichotomies, however, do not extend to the universe of all hereditary classes, which are classes closed under taking induced subgraphs. This leads to the natural question of whether we can extend known algorithmic dichotomies for monotone classes to larger families of hereditary classes. We give an affirmative answer to this question by considering the family of hereditary graph classes that are closed under self-intersection, which is known to be located strictly between the monotone and hereditary classes. We prove a new structural characterization of graphs in self-intersection-closed classes excluding a tripod. We use our characterization to give a complete dichotomy of Maximum Independent Set, and its weighted variant for self-intersection-closed classes defined by finitely many obstructions: these problems are in P if the class excludes a tripod and NP-hard otherwise. This generalizes several known results on Maximum Independent Set. We also use it to obtain dichotomies for Maximum Induced Matching on self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions. Similarly, we obtain dichotomies for Satisfiability and Counting Satisfiability on self-intersection-closed classes of (bipartite) incidence graphs defined by finitely many obstructions, and for boundedness of clique-width for self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions."}

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become \"inequalities of motion\" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap."}

While the general conjecture remains elusive, progress thus far has been made on two fronts: finite cases and asymptotic relaxations. The best finite results are due to Frankston and Scheinerman (2024) who verified the conjecture for $n \\leq 7$ using SAT solvers, and the best asymptotic result is due to Dvořák (2020), who showed that every $2$-edge-coloring of $Q_n$ admits an antipodal path of length $n$ with at most $0.375n + o(n)$ color changes. We improve on both fronts via SAT. First, we extend the verification to $n = 8$ by introducing a more compact and efficient SAT encoding, enhanced with symmetry breaking and cube-and-conquer parallelism. The versatility of this new encoding allows us to recast parts of Dvořák's asymptotic approach as a SAT problem, thereby improving the asymptotic upper bound to $0.3125n + O(1)$ color changes. Our work demonstrates how SAT-based methods can yield not only finite-case confirmations but also asymptotic progress on combinatorial conjectures."}

The study of the possible size of the largest $r$-cut in a $k$-uniform hypergraph was initiated by Erdős and Kleitman in 1968. For graphs, a celebrated result of Edwards states that every $m$-edge graph has a $2$-cut of size $m/2+Ω(m^{1/2})$, which is sharp. In other words, there exists a cut which exceeds the expected size of a random cut by the order of $m^{1/2}$. Conlon, Fox, Kwan and Sudakov proved that any $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges has an $r$-cut whose size is $Ω(m^{5/9})$ larger than the expected size of a random $r$-cut, provided that $k \\geq 4$ or $r \\geq 3$. They further conjectured that this can be improved to $Ω(m^{2/3})$, which would be sharp. Recently, Räty and Tomon improved the bound $m^{5/9}$ to $m^{3/5-o(1)}$ when $r \\in \\{ k-1,k\\}$.\n  Using a novel approach, we prove the following approximate version of the Conlon-Fox-Kwan-Sudakov conjecture: for each $\\varepsilon>0$, there is some $k_0=k_0(\\varepsilon)$ such that for all $k>k_0$ and $2\\leq r\\leq k$, in every $k$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges there exists an $r$-cut exceeding the random one by $Ω(m^{2/3-\\varepsilon})$. Moreover, we show that (if $k\\geq 4$ or $r\\geq 3$) every $k$-uniform linear hypergraph has an $r$-cut exceeding the random one by $Ω(m^{3/4})$, which is tight and proves a conjecture of Räty and Tomon."}

(2) It is, to our knowledge, the first such net that includes balanced vertices whose incident edges are not exhibiting symmetries of any kind. (3) The approach taken in the construction is quite promising as it might have the potential for generalization. This would allow to construct a series of irreducible geodesic nets with four boundary vertices and an arbitrary number of balanced vertices, answering a conjecture that the number of balanced vertices is in fact unbounded for nets with four boundary vertices. This would stand in stark contrast to the previously proven theorem that for three boundary vertices, there can be at most one single balanced vertex."}

An algorithm proposed by Micali and Vazirani (1980) is well-known to solve the problem in $O(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, which is still one of the fastest algorithms in general. While the MV algorithm itself is not so complicated and is indeed convincing, its correctness proof is extremely challenging, which can be seen from the history: after the first algorithm paper had appeared in 1980, Vazirani has made several attempts to give a complete proof for more than 40 years. It seems, roughly speaking, caused by the nice but highly complex structure of the shortest alternating paths in general graphs that are deeply intertwined with the so-called (nested) blossoms.\n  In this paper, we propose a new structure theorem on the shortest alternating paths in general graphs without taking into the details of blossoms. The high-level idea is to forget the alternation (of matching and non-matching edges) as early as possible. A key ingredient is a notion of alternating base trees (ABTs) introduced by Izumi, Kitamura, and Yamaguchi (2024) to develop a nearly linear-time distributed algorithm. Our structure theorem refines the properties of ABTs exploited in their algorithm, and we also give simpler alternative proofs for them. Based on our structure theorem, we propose a new algorithm, which is slightly slower but more implementable and much easier to confirm its correctness than the MV algorithm.\n  As applications of our framework, we also present new $(1 - ε)$-approximation algorithms in the distributed and semi-streaming settings. Both algorithms are deterministic, and substantially improve the best known upper bounds on the running time. The algorithms are built on the top of a novel framework of amplifying approximation factors of given matchings, which is of independent interest."}
