Developing stable and rapidly converging vectorwise eigensolvers is a crucial step in improving the overall efficiency of their blockwise implementations. The present paper is concerned with the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method for Hermitian eigenvalue problems, and motivated by two recently proposed alternatives for its single-vector version LOPCG. A common basis of these eigensolvers is the well-known CG method for linear systems. However, the optimality of CG search directions cannot perfectly be transferred to CG-like eigensolvers. In particular, while computing clustered eigenvalues, LOPCG and its alternatives suffer from frequent delays, leading to a staircase-shaped convergence behavior which cannot be explained by the existing estimates. Keeping this in mind, we construct a class of cluster robust vector iterations where LOPCG is replaced by asymptotically equivalent two-term recurrences and the search directions are timely corrected by selecting a far previous iterate as augmentation. The new approach significantly reduces the number of required steps and the total computational time."}

In particular, linear approximation frameworks-such as spectral, finite-difference, or discontinuous Galerkin methods-often suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations or require carefully tuned stabilization mechanisms, whose effectiveness degrades in transport-dominated and long-time integration regimes. In this work, we introduce a sequential-in-time nonlinear parametrization (STNP) for solving fractional Burgers equations, including models with a fractional Laplacian or with nonlocal nonlinear fluxes. The solution is represented by a nonlinear parametric ansatz, and the parameter evolution is obtained by projecting the governing dynamics onto the tangent space of the parameter manifold through a regularized least-squares formulation at each time step. This yields a well-posed and stable time-marching scheme that preserves causality and avoids global-in-time optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting projected dynamics, including a stability estimate and an a posteriori error bound that explicitly decomposes the total error into contributions from initial condition fitting, projection residuals, and discretization of fractional operators. Our analysis clarifies the stabilizing role of regularization and quantifies its interaction with the nonlocal discretization error. Numerical experiments for both fractional Burgers models demonstrate that STNP achieves oscillation-free shock resolution and accurately captures long-time dynamics. The method consistently outperforms high-order spectral schemes augmented with spectral vanishing viscosity, while requiring significantly fewer degrees of freedom and avoiding ad hoc stabilization."}

In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure."}

Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes."}

In both solution reconstruction and inverse problems, model parameters are estimated with the help of measurement data. In practice, experimentalists seek to design experiments such that the acquired data leads to the most robust recovery of the missing parameters in a subsequent inverse problem. While there are well-established techniques for designing experiments with standard approaches to the inverse problem, optimal experimental design (OED) has yet to be explored with the ECFM formulation. In this work, we investigate OED with a constraint force objective. First, we review traditional approaches to OED based on the Fisher information matrix, and propose an analogous formulation based on constraint forces. Next, we reflect on the different interpretations of the objective from standard and constraint force-based inverse problems. We then test our method on several example problems. These examples suggest that an experiment which is optimal in the sense of constraint forces tends to position measurements in the stiffest regions of the system. Because the responses -- and thus the measurements -- are small in these regions, this strategy is impractical in the presence of measurement noise and/or finite measurement precision. As such, our provisional conclusion is that ECFM is not a viable approach to OED."}

Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface."}

Categories in that setting are often assumed to be univalent which means that identities and isomorphisms of objects coincide. One consequence hereof is that equivalences and identities coincide for univalent categories and that structure on univalent categories transfers along equivalences. However, constructions such as the Kleisli category, the Karoubi envelope, and the tripos-to-topos construction, do not necessarily give univalent categories. To deal with that problem, one uses the Rezk completion, which completes a category into a univalent one. However, to use the Rezk completion when considering categories with structure, one also needs to show that the Rezk completion inherits the structure from the original category. In this work, we present a modular framework for lifting the Rezk completion from categories to categories with structure. We demonstrate the modularity of our framework by lifting the Rezk completion from categories to elementary topoi in manageable steps."}

To assess the validity of the concavity assumption, we construct a test for the nonparametric null hypothesis that the distribution function is concave on the positive half-line, against the alternative that it is not.

The theoretical justification for calibration led us to establish a bootstrap version of Theorem 1 in Söhl and Trabs (2012), a Donsker-type result from which we obtain, as a special case, the limiting behavior of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function in a bootstrap setting with measurement error. Combining this Donsker-type theorem with the functional delta method, we show that the test statistic and its bootstrap version have the same limiting distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas under the alternative, the bootstrap statistic is stochastically smaller.

We derive a specific form of the nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity explicitly appears in the time-derivative terms that govern the evolution of the mechanical fields. The numerical solution is established using a fully discrete formulation that combines the standard finite element method for spatial discretization with the implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT)-$α$ scheme for time integration. To address the nonlinear nature of the discrete system, we employ Newton's method to iteratively solve the linearized equations at each time step. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are rigorously verified through convergence analyses, which demonstrate optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study is conducted to elucidate the influence of the model's constitutive parameters. The results reveal that the magnitude parameter of the stress-dependent variation in wave speed leads to wavefront steepening and the formation of shock discontinuities. Conversely, the exponent parameter acts as a nonlinearity filter; high values suppress nonlinear effects in small-strain regimes, whereas low values allow significant dispersive behavior. This work provides a validated tool for analyzing shock formation in advanced nonlinear materials."}

The analysis applies to curves beyond the nodal case and is not restricted to plane curves, encompassing curves lying on smooth projective surfaces as well as families with more general isolated singularities. Using deformation-theoretic and residue-theoretic methods, we describe how the infinitesimal period map decomposes into local contributions supported at singular points, together with global constraints arising from the geometry of the normalization. While nodal singularities give rise to nontrivial rank-one contributions, other singularities may contribute only through higher-order local data or may be invisible at the infinitesimal level. As a consequence, we obtain sharp criteria for maximal infinitesimal variation in terms of numerical invariants of the curve, notably when the number of nodes satisfies the inequality $δ\\ge g$, where $g$ denotes the genus of the normalization.\n  We extend these results to curves on very general surfaces in projective three-space, showing that maximal variation persists on Picard-rank-one surfaces but fails for sufficiently large genus in the presence of higher ADE singularities. These results extend classical maximality phenomena in infinitesimal Hodge theory to a broader singular and geometric setting."}

However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time."}

This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks."}

We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs.

We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness."}

This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature.

Starting from a high-order spatial baseline discretisation (in this case, the CIP stabilised finite element method), our approach formulates the fully discrete problem as a variational inequality posed on a closed convex set of tensor-valued functions that respect the same eigenvalue bounds at their degrees of freedom. The numerical realisation of the scheme relies on the definition of a projection that, at each node, performs the diagonalisation of the tensor and then truncates the eigenvalues to lie within the prescribed bounds. The temporal discretisation is carried out using the implicit Euler method, and unconditional stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for this choice. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the method's ability to maintain eigenvalue constraints while accurately approximating solutions in the convection-dominated regime."}

Our goal is to provide some insights on the structure of the subdiferential of the value function. In particular, we establish a connection between the evolution of the subgradients of the value function and a stochastic difference equation of Hamiltonian type. This result can be seen as a transposition of the method of characteristics, introduced by Rockafellar and Wolenski in the 2000s, to the stochastic discrete-time setting. Similarly as done in the literature for the deterministic case, the analysis is based on a duality approach. For this reason we study first a dual representation for the value function in terms of the value function of a dual problem, which is a pseudo Bolza problem. The main difference with the deterministic case is that (due to the non-anticipativity) the symmetry between the Bolza problem and its dual is no longer valid. This in turn implies that ensuring the existence of minimizers for the Bolza problem (which is a key point for establishing the method of characteristics) is not as simple as in the deterministic case, and it should be addressed differently. To complete the exposition, we study the existence of minimizers for a particular class of Bolza problems governed by linear stochastic difference equations, the so-called linear-convex optimal control problems."}

This definition is mostly a formality and not used used in explicit computations or approximation schemes. We present a definition of the integral that uses triangulations instead. Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over Hölder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal."}

In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity.\n  A key result by Babai and Szemerédi (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression.\n  In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL."}

The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \\emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix."}

We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency.

A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data.

Despite its modeling advantages, optimization under GNL is highly challenging: even the pure assortment problem is NP-hard, and existing approaches rely on approximation schemes or are limited to simple cardinality constraints. In this paper, we develop the first exact and near-exact algorithms for constrained assortment and joint assortment--pricing optimization (JAP) under GNL. Our approach reformulates the problem into bilinear and exponential-cone convex programs and exploits convexity, concavity, and submodularity properties to generate strong cutting planes within a Branch-and-Cut framework (B\\&C). We further extend this framework to the mixed GNL (MGNL) model, capturing heterogeneous customer segments, and to JAP with discrete prices. For the continuous pricing case, we propose a near-exact algorithm based on piecewise-linear approximation (PWLA) that achieves arbitrarily high precision under general linear constraints. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform state-of-the-art approximation approaches in both solution quality and scalability. In particular, we are able to solve large-scale instances with up to 1000 products and 20 nests, and to obtain near-optimal solutions for continuous pricing problems with negligible optimality gaps.

A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function representation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automorphic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi-automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomorphic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation behavior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients.

The framework is demonstrated on four control problems spanning a gradient of dynamical complexity, from canonical linear systems through nonlinear oscillatory dynamics to three-dimensional spacecraft attitude control with gyroscopic coupling and thrust constraints. Results demonstrate that an LLM with explicit reasoning, optimized via GRPO, can synthesize feasible stabilizing policies under consistent training settings across both linear and nonlinear systems. The two-stage training methodology enables models to generate control sequences while providing human-readable explanations of their decision-making process.

Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas."}

Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase.

We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation.

This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays.

Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic.

The variable projection (VarPro) method provides an efficient approach for solving such problems by eliminating linear variables and reducing the problem to a smaller, nonlinear one. In this work, we extend VarPro to solve minimization problems containing a differentiable regularization term on the nonlinear parameters, along with a general-form Tikhonov regularization term on the linear variables. Furthermore, we develop a quasi-Newton method for solving the resulting reduced problem, and provide a local convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions, establishing conditions for superlinear or quadratic convergence. For large-scale settings, we introduce an inexact LSQR-based variant and prove its local convergence despite inner-solve and Hessian approximations. Numerical experiments on semi-blind deblurring show that parameter regularization prevents degenerate no-blur solutions and that the proposed methods achieve accurate reconstructions, with the inexact variant offering a favorable accuracy-cost tradeoff consistent with the theory."}

The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential."}

Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches.

Significant works due to Erdős, Rademacher, Lovász and Simonovits investigated the supersaturation problem for the triangle. Moreover, Kang, Makai and Pikhurko studied the case for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a vertex. Building upon the pivotal results established by Bollobás, Nikiforov, Ning and Zhai on counting triangles via the spectral radius, we study in this paper the spectral supersaturation problem for the bowtie. Let $λ(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$, and let $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q$ be the graph obtained from Turán graph $T_{n,2}$ by adding $q$ pairwise disjoint edges to the partite set of size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$.

These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric."}

Existing methods for computing regions require the explicit equation of the hypersurface as input. However, computing this equation by elimination can be computationally demanding or even infeasible. Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface."}

In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing."}

Ultrametrics are essentially distances that can be represented by an edge-weighted rooted tree so that all of the distances in the tree from the root to any leaf of the tree are equal. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ultrametrics called arboreal ultrametrics which have applications in phylogenetics and also arise in the theory of distance-hereditary graphs. These are partial distances, that is distances that are not necessarily defined for every pair of elements in the groundset, that can be represented by an ultrametric arboreal network, that is, an edge-weighted rooted network whose underlying graph is a tree. As with ultrametrics all of the distances in the ultrametric arboreal network from any root to any leaf below it are are equal but, in contrast, the network may have more than one root. In our two main results we characterize when a partial distance is an arboreal ultrametric as well as proving that, somewhat surprisingly, given any unrooted edge-weighted phylogenetic tree there is a necessarily unique way to insert roots into this tree so as to obtain an arboreal ultrametric."}

Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cramér--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD."}

Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis."}

That goal has been achieved as a (patient) reader will discover. In another sense, this work is a partial review of the last half-century's worth of progress in the evaluation of a particular set of 3F2(1), in particular those cases where at least one parameter is an integer or two or more parameters are separated by an integer. The result is a collection of very general identities (or techniques) that an analyst seeking to evaluate a particular 3F2(1), might want to consider as a starting point.

This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks."}

To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited."}

It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization."}

This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable."}

We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior."}

In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure."}

We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} γn^6 \\log n$, where $γ$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $γn^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hliněný [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width."}

For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises."}

By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes."}

By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\\varphi(f))$, where $\\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner."}
