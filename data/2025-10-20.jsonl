As bandwidth continues to grow, WiFi channels exhibit increased\nfrequency selectivity, which poses new challenges for MU-MIMO user selection:\nthe optimal user set varies across frequency and is interleaved over subbands\n(called resource units, or RUs). This frequency selectivity, coupled with the\ncomplex subband allocation pattern, renders conventional narrowband user\nselection algorithms inefficient for 802.11ax. In this paper, we propose\n\\emph{ProxySelect}, a scalable and frequency selectivity-aware user scheduling\nalgorithm for joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO usage in 802.11ax under zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF). The scheduling task is formulated as an integer linear\nprogram (ILP) with binary variables indicating user (group)-RU associations,\nand linear constraints ensuring standard compatibility. To reduce complexity,\nwe introduce a novel proxy rate--a function of individual channel strengths and\ntheir correlations--that approximates the ZFBF rate without requiring\ncubic-complexity matrix inversion. Additionally, we develop a sampling-based\ncandidate group generation scheme that selects up to $T$ near-orthogonal user\ngroups for each RU, thereby bounding the ILP size and ensuring scalability.\nSimulations using realistic ray-tracing-based channel models show that\nProxySelect achieves near-optimal rate performance with significantly lower\ncomplexity."}

However, their proof,\nbecause existential, does not provide any information on these excluded minors.\nSeymour proved in 1993 the first and, until now, only known upper bound on the\norder of the minimal excluded minors for a given surface. This bound is double\nexponential in the Euler genus $g$ of the surface and, therefore, very far from\nthe $\\Omega(g)$ lower bound on the maximal order of minimal excluded minors for\na surface and most likely far from the best possible bound. More than thirty\nyears later, this paper finally makes progress in lowering this bound to a\nquasi-polynomial in the Euler genus of the surface.\n  The main catalyzer to reach a quasi-polynomial bound is a breakthrough on the\ncharacteristic size of a forbidden structure for a minimal excluded minor $G$\nfor a surface of Euler genus $g$: although it is not hard to show that $G$ does\nnot contain $O(g)$ disjoint cycles that are contractible and nested in some\nembedding of $G$ as demonstrated by Seymour, this bound can be lowered to\n$O(\\log g)$ which is essential to obtain the quasi-polynomial bound in this\npaper.\n  As subsidiary results, we also improve the current bound on the treewidth of\na minimal excluded minor $G$ for a surface by improving the first and, until\nnow, only known bound provided by Seymour."}

More data translates\ninto better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives\nsaved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication\ninfrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely\ndifficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate\nand assist them in time.

This paper\nintroduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network\nframework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework\nadopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an\nencoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing\nlatent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical\nspaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is\ninvestigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to\nincorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs\nsignificantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical\nefficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical\nexperiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations\ndemonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction\ncapabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's\nflexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to\ngeneralize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a\nscalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning."}

This paper aims at striking a balance\nbetween classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable\ntrustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on\na user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid\nsolver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of\npredictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality\ncannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the\npaper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and\ndual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that\nthe hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves\nspeedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while\nguaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%."}
