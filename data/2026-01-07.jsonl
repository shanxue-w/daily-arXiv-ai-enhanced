The particle system evolves as a continuous-time pure jump process: the leading particle moves independently, at Exponential jump times, with constant jump rate and iid jump sizes distributed according to a law $θ$, while each of the remaining particles jumps forward, at Exponential times, at rate equal to its distance from the particle immediately ahead, with jump sizes drawn uniformly from the corresponding gap. The dynamics thus encode competition for leadership together with distance-dependent stochastic interactions. Our main focus is the associated gap process, representing the vector of inter-particle distances. We establish the existence of a unique stationary distribution for the gap process and prove uniform geometric ergodicity. Further, when the leader's jump sizes follow an Exponential distribution, we identify the stationary law explicitly as a product of independent Exponential laws, and show that the associated mixing time scales between $Θ(n)$ and $O(n(\\log n)^2)$ for an $n$-particle system. As an application of the mixing time results we establish a functional limit theorem that characterizes fluctuations of particle states at large time, under a suitable spatial and temporal scaling and large particle limit. Finally, when the leader's jumps have heavy but integrable tails, we show that each gap has at least one additional finite moment under stationarity than that of the leader's jump size distribution. The model offers a tractable setting for exploring ergodicity, explicit invariant laws, and mixing behavior in non-diffusive particle systems."}

A high-fidelity computational model incorporating compressible flow theory and equilibrium chemistry is used to simulate the combustion dynamics. An adaptive tracking controller is designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller synthesized around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC provides an effective and reliable approach for thrust regulation in SFRJs. In addition, a systematic hyperparameter sensitivity study is conducted by varying the tuning parameters over several orders of magnitude. The resulting responses show that the closed-loop performance and tracking error remain stable across wide parameter variations, indicating that DMAC exhibits strong robustness to hyper parameter tuning."}

Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples.

Concretely, a \\emph{diffusion step} is defined to be one application of a symmetric stochastic matrix (the half-lazy walk operator) to an $\\ell^{1}$--normalized state vector, followed by an optional readout of selected coordinates.\n  Let $N\\ge 3$ be an odd integer which is neither prime nor a prime power, and let $b\\in(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\ast$ have odd multiplicative order $r={\\rm ord}_N(b)$. We construct, without knowing $r$ in advance, a weighted Cayley graph whose vertex set is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle b\\rangle$ and whose edges correspond to the powers $b^{\\pm 2^t}$ for $t\\le \\lfloor \\log_2 N\\rfloor+1$. Using an explicit spectral decomposition together with an elementary doubling lemma, we show that $r$ can be recovered from a single heat-kernel value after at most $O((\\log_2 N)^2)$ diffusion steps, with an effective bound.\n  We then combine this order-finding model with the standard reduction from factoring to order finding (in the spirit of Shor's framework) to obtain a randomized factorization procedure whose success probability depends only on the number $m$ of distinct prime factors of $N$. Our comparison with Shor's algorithm is \\emph{conceptual and model-based}. We replace unitary $\\ell^2$ evolution by Markovian $\\ell^1$ evolution, and we report complexity in two cost measures: digital steps and diffusion steps.

Our setting generalizes the classical one, in a ``dual'' direction to previously considered generalizations: while previous research was mostly concerned with variations of ground fields/rings, over which the vertices of polytopes are defined, we consider more general collections of defining hyperplanes. No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations. Studying these properties is possible in a general topological setting, that is, in the context of the so-called topological arrangements, where hyperplanes do not have to be straight and may even have nontrivial topology."}

For this model, they proved that the diffusion limit of its queue length process in heavy traffic is the level-dependent reflected Brownian motion of [6]. In a subsequent study, Kobayashi et al. [4] derived the corresponding diffusion limit of the stationary distribution. These studies are motivated by the control of service capacity depending on the queue length. We are interested in the more general case where this control may also depend on the history of the queue length. As the first step toward such a generalization, we specialize the multi-level GI/G/1 queue to a two-level M/M/1 queue. We then extend the dynamics of this model so that its arrival and service rates depend not only on the current queue length but also on the recent history of queue lengths. Under the stability condition for this model, we first compute its stationary distribution in closed form, then derive its diffusion limit in heavy traffic. Finally, using this diffusion limit, we derive approximation formulas for the stationary distribution and then numerically assess their accuracy."}

Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal."}

We consider spatial domains with smooth boundaries and formulate both linear and nonlinear BCs using mass flux, Riemann's invariants, and Bernoulli's potential, ensuring that the resulting initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is provably entropy- and energy-stable. The linear analysis is comprehensive, providing sufficient conditions to establish the existence, uniqueness, and energy stability of solutions to the linear IBVP.

We introduce the concepts of linear consistency and linear stability for nonlinear IBVPs, demonstrating that if a nonlinear IBVP is both linearly consistent and linearly stable, then, for sufficiently regular initial and boundary data over a finite time interval, a unique smooth solution exists. Both the linear and nonlinear IBVPs can be efficiently solved using high-order accurate numerical methods.

The particle system evolves as a continuous-time pure jump process: the leading particle moves independently, at Exponential jump times, with constant jump rate and iid jump sizes distributed according to a law $θ$, while each of the remaining particles jumps forward, at Exponential times, at rate equal to its distance from the particle immediately ahead, with jump sizes drawn uniformly from the corresponding gap. The dynamics thus encode competition for leadership together with distance-dependent stochastic interactions. Our main focus is the associated gap process, representing the vector of inter-particle distances. We establish the existence of a unique stationary distribution for the gap process and prove uniform geometric ergodicity. Further, when the leader's jump sizes follow an Exponential distribution, we identify the stationary law explicitly as a product of independent Exponential laws, and show that the associated mixing time scales between $Θ(n)$ and $O(n(\\log n)^2)$ for an $n$-particle system. As an application of the mixing time results we establish a functional limit theorem that characterizes fluctuations of particle states at large time, under a suitable spatial and temporal scaling and large particle limit. Finally, when the leader's jumps have heavy but integrable tails, we show that each gap has at least one additional finite moment under stationarity than that of the leader's jump size distribution. The model offers a tractable setting for exploring ergodicity, explicit invariant laws, and mixing behavior in non-diffusive particle systems."}

On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior."}

We study local decision-theoretic robustness by allowing the posterior to vary within a small Kullback-Leibler neighborhood and choosing actions that minimize worst-case posterior expected loss. Exploiting low-dimensional functionals available under exchangeability, we (i) adapt decision-theoretic robustness to exchangeable graphs via graphon limits and derive sharp small-radius expansions of robust posterior risk; under squared loss the leading inflation is controlled by the posterior variance of the loss, and for robustness indices that diverge at percolation/fragmentation thresholds we obtain a universal critical exponent describing the explosion of decision uncertainty near criticality. (ii) Develop a nonparametric minimax theory for robust model selection between sparse Erdos-Renyi and block models, showing-via robustness error exponents-that no Bayesian or frequentist method can uniformly improve upon the decision-theoretic limits over configuration models and sparse graphon classes for percolation-type functionals.

The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $α>0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD."}

Concretely, Tutte's path theorem asserts that this graph is connected, and his homotopy theorem asserts that every cycle in the graph is a composition of ''elementary cycles'', which come in four different flavors. We present an extended version of the homotopy theorem, in which we give a more refined classification of the different types of elementary cycles. We explain in detail how the path theorem allows one to prove that the foundation of a matroid (in the sense of Baker--Lorscheid) is generated by universal cross-ratios, and how the extended homotopy theorem allows one to classify all algebraic relations between universal cross-ratios. The resulting ''fundamental presentation'' of the foundation was previously established in [Baker--Lorscheid], but the argument here is more self-contained. We then recall a few applications of the fundamental presentation to the representation theory of matroids. Finally, in the most novel but also the most speculative part of the paper, we discuss what a ''higher Tutte homotopy theorem'' might look like, and we present some preliminary computations along these lines."}

The stochastic block model (SBM) explains such structure by positing a latent partition of nodes and block-specific edge distributions. In Bayesian SBMs, standard MCMC alternates between updating the partition and sampling block parameters, which can hinder mixing and complicate principled comparison across different partitions and numbers of communities. We develop a collapsed Bayesian SBM framework in which block-specific nuisance parameters are analytically integrated out under conjugate priors, so the marginal likelihood p(Y|z) depends only on the partition z and blockwise sufficient statistics. This yields fast local Gibbs/Metropolis updates based on ratios of closed-form integrated likelihoods and provides evidence-based complexity control that discourages gratuitous over-partitioning. We derive exact collapsed marginals for the most common SBM edge types-Beta-Bernoulli (binary), Gamma-Poisson (counts), and Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Gaussian weights)-and we extend collapsing to gap-constrained SBMs via truncated conjugate priors that enforce explicit upper bounds on between-community connectivity. We further show that the same collapsed strategy supports directed SBMs that model reciprocity through dyad states, signed SBMs via categorical block models, and multiplex SBMs where multiple layers contribute additive evidence for a shared partition. Across synthetic benchmarks and real networks (including email communication, hospital contact counts, and citation graphs), collapsed inference produces accurate partitions and interpretable posterior block summaries of within- and between-community interaction strengths while remaining computationally simple and modular."}

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm."}

This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schrödinger regularization provides an $O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter.

In addition, it accommodates null hypotheses expressed as unions of several component regions and can be applied to models involving nuisance parameters.

In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees."}

We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general.

[4] derived the corresponding diffusion limit of the stationary distribution. These studies are motivated by the control of service capacity depending on the queue length. We are interested in the more general case where this control may also depend on the history of the queue length. As the first step toward such a generalization, we specialize the multi-level GI/G/1 queue to a two-level M/M/1 queue. We then extend the dynamics of this model so that its arrival and service rates depend not only on the current queue length but also on the recent history of queue lengths.

When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance."}

The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $α>0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD."}

No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations.

Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\\mathbf{F}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\\mathbf{G}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\\ldots,W_K$.

Here, we advance this method in two complementary directions. First, we extend the method using a regularizer based on the total generalized variation (TGV) norm, in order to reconstruct a larger class of noise spectra, namely piecewise-linear noise spectra, which more realistically model many physical systems. We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems."}

These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases.

PFEM consists of a physics informed pretraining stage and an optional finetuning stage. In the pretraining stage, a neural operator based on the Transolver architecture is trained solely from governing partial differential equations, without relying on labeled solution data. The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance.

A critical step in this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process is the determination of appropriate criteria weights. However, deriving these weights often solely involves either subjective assessment from decision-makers or objective weighting methods, each of which has limitations in terms of cognitive burden, potential bias, and insufficient contextual relevance. This study proposes the subjective-objective median-based importance technique (SOMIT), a novel hybrid approach for determining criteria weights in MCDM. By tailoring SOMIT to renewable energy evaluation, the method directly supports applied energy system planning, policy analysis, and technology prioritization under carbon neutrality goals. The practical utility of SOMIT is demonstrated through two MCDM case studies on renewable energy decision-making in India and Saudi Arabia. Using the derived weights from SOMIT, the TOPSIS method ranks the renewable energy alternatives, with solar power achieving the highest performance scores in both cases. The main contributions of this work are five-fold: 1) the proposed SOMIT reduces the number of required subjective comparisons from the conventional quadratic order to a linear order; 2) SOMIT is more robust to outliers in the alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM); 3) SOMIT balances subjective expert knowledge with objective data-driven insights, thereby mitigating bias; 4) SOMIT is inherently modular, allowing both its individual parts and the complete approach to be seamlessly coupled with a wide range of MCDM methods commonly applied in energy systems and policy analysis; 5) a dedicated Python library, pysomit, is developed for SOMIT."}

No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed.

On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior."}

When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance."}

While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings."}

The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay. We showed that the center mass of the floating body cannot converge to its equilibrium faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ in 2D without viscosity and faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/2})$ with viscosity."}

Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.\n  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations.

In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings.

This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schrödinger regularization provides an $O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter.
