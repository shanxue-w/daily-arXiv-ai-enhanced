In our construction, Phase 1 learns a\nsuper-resolution map from coarse to fine solutions, while Phase 2 embeds this\noperator in a predictor-corrector loop with the coarse solver, forming an\noperator composition that serves as a surrogate fine grid propagator for\nfuture-time extrapolation. We benchmark SRaFTE on three canonical\ntwo-dimensional PDEs of increasing dynamical complexity: the heat equation, the\nwave equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to\nwell-known benchmarks, SRaFTE provides reliable super-resolution in Phase 1 and\ndelivers consistently accurate long-term forecasts in Phase 2 across all three\nexamples for new test data.

Building on prior efforts\ninvolving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants,\nbased on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions.\nFor the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs)\nand non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model\nreduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty\nis the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each\nother, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic\nwave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition\nchoice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy,\nand stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than\nalternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce\nspurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf\ncouplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and\nmitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM\nreference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight\nNO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient\nmulti-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing\nthe need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and\npredictive settings."}

In this study, a\nrigorous mathematical analysis is presented to explore the ability and\nmechanisms of PSO to escape from LO. By modelling each search agent as a Markov\nchain, the probability of PSO escaping from LO within a finite number of\niterations is calculated, and the behavior of agents prior to escaping from LO\nis analyzed. Through this theoretical analysis, two necessary and sufficient\nconditions are proposed to ensure that PSO escapes from LO in finite iterations\nwith a probability 1: (a) the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest)\npositions stagnate around different local optima, and (b) the inertial weight\nin PSO is equal to one.

Specifically, we design a hybrid\nevent-triggering mechanism that takes into account both the size and direction\nshift of the error state. The proposed event-triggered SMC law is shown to\nenforce and sustain the system state in the ideal sliding mode cone. Moreover,\nthe state of the closed-loop system can asymptotically converge to the\nequilibrium point, rather than merely to a neighborhood of it, which is usually\ndifficult to handle by using practical sliding mode band. Technically speaking,\nto achieve strong convergence, the triggering frequency should naturally be as\nhigh as possible due to the existence of the external disturbances, but this\nwill also increase the communication load. Hence, to balance the asymptotic\nconvergence and frequent triggering near the equilibrium point that is the\nprice paid for achieving asymptotic stability, we extend the obtained results\nto the case of practical sliding mode cone.

In this paper, we propose to introduce a cardinality\nconstraint into the BCEP to limit the number of expansion locations rather than\nfixing such locations beforehand. This allows us to search over all possible\nlink combinations within the prescribed limit, thereby enabling the joint\noptimization of both expansion locations and capacity levels.

While classical analysis\nfocuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational\nconstraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for\nboth parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist\nframeworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power\nregimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the\n`power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty,\nmaking it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a\n`safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps.\nOne map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone\ncorresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden\n`power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This\nframework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing\nnew theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design\nphilosophies."}

We show, however, that even in the simple\ncase where the energy functional is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nagainst a smooth target density, forward-Euler can fail dramatically: the\nscheme does not converge to the gradient flow, despite the fact that the first\nvariation $\\nabla\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta\\rho}$ remains formally well defined at\nevery step. We identify the root cause as a loss of regularity induced by the\ndiscretization, and prove that a suitable regularization of the functional\nrestores the necessary smoothness, making forward-Euler a viable solver that\nconverges in discrete time to the global minimizer."}

In fact, we prove a generalisation of\nCameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column\nparities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between\nrows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).\n  Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of\nrandom Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable\nintercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin\nsquares with a certain independent model."}

They belong to the\nset of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a gamma\nvector equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials\nwhose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is\nexpected that the cases where the gamma vector is 0 form ``building blocks''\namong those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a\ncertain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is\ncurrently poorly understood.\n  For such toric varieties, we address this situation using wall crossings. The\nlinks of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace\nin its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of\nthese links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension\nof one. The intersection patterns between these ``anchoring'' linear subspaces\ncome from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and\nparity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and\ncontainment relations between them. We obtain these relations by viewing the\nvanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents.\nFinally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced\n4-cycles expected to cover the minimal objects described above."}
