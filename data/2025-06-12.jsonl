It is a key component of Earth system state estimation and is\ncommonly used in weather and ocean forecasting. The approach involves a\nlarge-scale generalized nonlinear least-squares problem.

Due to\nthe presence of logarithmic singularities at $u=\\pm 1$, the solution $u$ is\nconstrained within the interval $(-1,1)$. While convex splitting schemes are\ncommonly employed to preserve this bound and guarantee unconditional unique\nsolvability, their practical implementation requires solving nonlinear systems\ncontaining singular logarithmic terms at each time step. This introduces\nsignificant challenges in both ensuring convergence of iterative solvers and\nmaintaining the solution bounds throughout the iterations. Existing solvers\noften rely on restrictive conditions -- such as the strict separation property\nor small time step sizes -- to ensure convergence, which can limit their\napplicability. In this work, we introduce a novel iterative solver that is\nspecifically designed for singular nonlinear systems, with the use of a variant\nof the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

As a by-product, we establish a novel and general\nspectral condition on the equivalence of measures on the paths of multivariate\nGRFs with component fields of varying smoothnesses, a result of independent\nimportance. We show that for the Mat\\'ern, power-exponential, generalized\nCauchy, and coregionalization families, the necessary and sufficient conditions\nbecome identical, thereby providing a complete characterization of consistent\nestimability of the slope under spatial confounding. The results are extended\nto accommodate measurement error using local-averaging-and-differencing based\nestimators. Finite sample behavior is explored via numerical experiments."}

Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new\ninsights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can\neffectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol\nrate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication\nspectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath\nchannels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the\nspectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds\ncorresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the\npresence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the\nsymbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR\nvariation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the\nmaximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in\nterms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN\nsignals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance.

By data points, we mean that the points\ncontain some uncertainty, which is a key motivation for the approximate\ntreatment. A careful review of the existing border basis concept for an exact\ntreatment motivates a new adaptation of the border basis concept for an\napproximate treatment. In the study of approximately vanishing polynomials, the\nnormalization of polynomials plays a vital role. So far, the most common\nnormalization in computational commutative algebra uses the coefficient norm of\na polynomial. Inspired by recent developments in machine learning, the present\npaper proposes and studies the use of gradient-weighted normalization. The\ngradient-weighted semi-norm evaluates the gradient of a polynomial at the data\npoints. This data-driven nature of gradient-weighted normalization produces, on\nthe one hand, better stability against perturbation and, on the other hand,\nvery significantly, invariance of border bases with respect to scaling the data\npoints. Neither property is achieved with coefficient normalization. In\nparticular, we present an example of the lack of scaling invariance with\nrespect to coefficient normalization, which can cause an approximate border\nbasis computation to fail. This is extremely relevant because scaling of the\npoint set is often recommended for preprocessing the data. Further, we use an\nexisting algorithm with coefficient normalization to show that it is easily\nadapted to gradient-weighted normalization. The analysis of the adapted\nalgorithm only requires tiny changes, and the time complexity remains the same.\nFinally, we present numerical experiments on three affine varieties to\ndemonstrate the superior stability of our data-driven normalization over\ncoefficient normalization. We obtain robustness to perturbations and invariance\nto scaling."}

Particularly during peak hours, the massive ride-hailing vehicles\nwaiting to drop off obstruct curb spaces and even disrupt the flow of mainline\ntraffic. However, there is a lack of an analytical model that formulates and\nmitigates the congestion effects of ride-hailing drop-offs in curb spaces. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel bi-modal two-tandem bottleneck\nmodel to depict the commuting behaviors of private vehicles (PVs) and\nride-hailing vehicles (RVs) during the morning peak in a linear city. In the\nmodel, the upstream bottleneck models the congestion on highways, and the\ndownstream curbside bottlenecks depict the congestion caused by RV drop-offs in\ncurb spaces, PV queue on main roads, and the spillover effects between them in\nthe urban area. The proposed model can be solved in a closed form under eight\ndifferent scenarios. A time-varying optimal congestion pricing scheme, combined\ncurbside pricing and parking pricing, is proposed to achieve the social\noptimum. It is found that potential waste of road capacity could occur when\nthere is a mismatch between the highway and curbside bottlenecks, and hence the\noptimal pricing should be determined in a coordinated manner. A real-world case\nfrom Hong Kong shows that the limited curb space and main road in the urban\narea could be the major congestion bottleneck. Expanding the capacity of the\ncurb space or the main road in the urban area, rather than the highway\nbottleneck, can effectively reduce social costs.

Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both\nNDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its\ncognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas\ninto NDL improves model performance over the traditional model.

To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a\ngeneralization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised\ncontrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment\nterm for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and\naffords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class\nembeddings.

A central\nresult is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly\nfrom the underlying gauge subsystem symmetries, revealing that the classic\nKelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the\nassociated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level\ndetermined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond gauge\nsymmetries, we also identify global subsystem symmetries, construct the\ncorresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications."}

The lower level then matches\nconverted agents to minimize operational costs, such as pooling riders with\nsimilar itineraries into the same vehicle or consolidating multiple delivery\norders into a single trip. Motivated by these applications, we study the\noptimal value (cost) function of a linear programming model with respect to\nagent arrival rates, originally proposed by Aouad and Saritac (2022) for\ncost-minimizing dynamic stochastic matching under limited time. In particular,\nwe investigate the concavity of this cost function. We show that weak concavity\nholds when there are fewer than or equal to three agent types with identical\npatience level. For an arbitrary number of agent types, (weak) concavity is\nmore likely to hold when agents have high or similar patience, or when agents\nare more heterogeneous in their matching efficiencies.

This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving\nlanes. We also propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for\nthe one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow\nvariables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized\ninstances.
