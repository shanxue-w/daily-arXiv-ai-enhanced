The objective is to recover the initial\nelectric field $\\mathbf{E}_0$ in a bounded domain $\\Omega \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^3$, using boundary measurements of the electric field and its normal\nderivative over a finite time interval. Informed by practical constraints, we\nadopt an under-determined formulation of Maxwell's equations that avoids the\nneed for initial magnetic field data and charge density information. To address\nthis inverse problem, we develop a time-dimension reduction approach by\nprojecting the electric field onto a finite-dimensional Legendre\npolynomial-exponential basis in time. This reformulates the original space-time\nproblem into a sequence of spatial systems for the projection coefficients. The\nreconstruction is carried out using the quasi-reversibility method within a\nminimum-norm framework, which accommodates the inherent non-uniqueness of the\nunder-determined setting. We prove a convergence theorem that ensures the\nquasi-reversibility solution approximates the true solution as the noise and\nregularization parameters vanish. Numerical experiments in a fully\nthree-dimensional setting validate the method's performance. The reconstructed\ninitial electric field remains accurate even with $10\\%$ noise in the data,\ndemonstrating the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach to\nrealistic inverse electromagnetic problems."}

It is well known that standard homogenization approaches often fail\nto give an accurate solution due to the lack of macroscopic parameters.\nMulticontinuum approaches allow us to consider such cases by defining several\naverage states known as continua. In the field of poroelasticity,\nmultiple-network models arising from the multiple porous media theory are\nrepresentatives of these approaches. In this work, we extend previous findings\nby deriving the generalized multicontinuum poroelasticity model.

In practice, it faces unanticipated but spatially aligned\nrequests, passengers seeking to join ongoing schedules, leading to\nunderutilized capacity and degraded service if not properly managed. At the\nsame time, it must accommodate diverse passenger needs, from routine errands to\ntime-sensitive trips such as medical appointments. To meet these expectations,\nincorporating time flexibility is essential. However, existing models seldom\nconsider both spontaneous and heterogeneous demand, limiting their real-world\napplicability. We propose a robust and flexible microtransit framework that\nintegrates time flexibility and demand uncertainty via a Chance-Constrained\nDial-A-Ride Problem with Soft Time Windows (CCDARP-STW). Demand uncertainty is\ncaptured through nonlinear chance constraints with controllable violation\nprobabilities, while time flexibility is modeled with soft time windows and\npenalized cost. We develop a bounded-support relaxation using limited\nstatistical information to linearize the chance constraints and solve the model\nusing a tailored Branch-and-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm with a probabilistic\ndominance rule. This rule improves computational efficiency, reducing explored\nlabels by 17.40% and CPU time by 22.27% in robust cases. A case study based on\nreal-world Chicago data shows our framework yields 11.55 minutes and 11.13\nmiles of savings versus conventional microtransit, and achieves the highest\nservice reliability (96.46%) among robust models."}

The main result is a formula for the total Chern class of the\ntangent bundle of a toric variety bundle in terms of the total Chern class of\nthe base and the total Chern class of the toric fibre. The result serves as a\nsimultaneous generalization of the description of the total Chern class of a\nprojectivized vector bundle and of the formula for the total Chern class of a\ntoric variety in terms of the Chern classes of the toric divisors. We also\nestablish a topological version of this statement for stably complex quasitoric\nmanifolds. As an immediate application, we obtain a formula for the total Chern\nclass of a toroidal horospherical variety in terms of the Chern classes of the\ngeneralized flag variety and the total Chern class of the toric fibre, as well\nas a new proof of Masuda's formula for equivariant Chern classes."}

This implies that, for any connected graph\n$G$ different from $K_2$, we can turn $G$ into a locally irregular multigraph\n$M(G)$, i.e., in which no two adjacent vertices have the same degree, by\nreplacing some of its edges with at most three parallel edges. In this work, we\nintroduce and study a restriction of this problem under the additional\nconstraint that edges added to $G$ to reach $M(G)$ must form a walk (i.e., a\npath with possibly repeated edges and vertices) of $G$. We investigate the\ngeneral consequences of having this additional constraint, and provide several\nresults of different natures (structural, combinatorial, algorithmic) on the\nlength of the shortest irregularising walks, for general graphs and more\nrestricted classes."}
