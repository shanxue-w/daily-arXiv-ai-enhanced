At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly\nsingular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This\nnear-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear\nelasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular\nsystem is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by\nadding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution\nwhile ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur\ncomplement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the\npreconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh\nsize and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are\nconsidered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The\nefficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective\niterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES\nachieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement\npreconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient\nsolvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be\nreformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure\nvariable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy\nextends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also\nshow parameter-free convergence for the regularized system. Numerical\nexperiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the\nregularization strategy and the robustness of the block preconditioners."}

In particular, in the first case,\nif all the zeros of the polynomial $Q$ are real and less than $\\alpha+1$, then\nall the zeros of $q_n$, $n\\ge K$, are positive. In the other cases, if all the\nzeros of $P$ are real then all the zeros of $q_n$, $n\\ge K$, are also real. If\n$P$ has $m>1$ non-real zeros, there are important differences between the four\ncases. For instance in the first case, $q_n$ has still only real zeros for $n$\nbig enough, but in the fourth case $q_n$ has exactly $m$ non-real zeros for $n$\nbig enough."}

A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for\nestimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information\nacross datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals\nthat while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,\noptimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend\nour analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical\nalgorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical\nguidance for method selection in practical data integration problems.

At the macroscopic scale,\nporous electrodes are typically modeled using a dual-continuum approach,\ntreating the porous solid phase and the liquid electrolyte as spatially\nsuperimposed domains. Determining potential distributions requires solving two\nPoisson equations that are nonlinearly coupled through Butler-Volmer kinetics\nunder galvanostatic and potentiostatic operating modes. Under galvanostatic\noperation, these equations form an underconstrained singular system due to\nall-Neumann boundary conditions, posing numerical challenges. This paper\nsystematically presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled\nPoisson equations in dual-continuum porous electrodes, with a particular focus\non galvanostatic solutions. We mathematically establish solution uniqueness in\nterms of the potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte (or\noverpotential), as well as the individual potentials up to a shared constant\nshift. To resolve the nonuniqueness of the solution, we introduce three\nnumerical approaches: (1) Lagrange Constrained Method (LCM), (2) Dirichlet\nSubstitution Method (DSM), and (3) Global Constraining Method (GCM), where GCM\nenables solving the overpotential without imposing an explicit system reference\npotential. Additionally, we develop both decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear\nsolution strategies and evaluate their computational performance in both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous conductivity cases. The presented numerical\nmethods are general for addressing similar underconstrained nonlinear systems.\nA Python implementation is provided at\nhttps://github.com/harrywang1129/porous_electrode_solver."}

A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\\times7$\nmatrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\\rvert\\le0.18$\nwith probability $>99.98\\%$; because $\\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\\rvert =\n1/\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound\n$\\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\\ge5.7$."}

However, optimizing VaR metrics in Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) is challenging because VaR is non-additive and the traditional\ndynamic programming is inapplicable. This paper conducts a comprehensive study\non VaR optimization in discrete-time finite MDPs. We consider VaR in two key\nscenarios: the VaR of steady-state rewards over an infinite horizon and the VaR\nof accumulated rewards over a finite horizon. By establishing the equivalence\nbetween the VaR maximization MDP and a series of probabilistic minimization\nMDPs, we transform the VaR maximization MDP into a constrained bilevel\noptimization problem. The inner-level is a policy optimization of minimizing\nthe probability that MDP rewards fall below a target $\\lambda$, while the\nouter-level is a single parameter optimization of $\\lambda$, representing the\ntarget VaR. For the steady-state scenario, the probabilistic minimization MDP\ncan be resolved using the expectation criterion of a standard MDP. In contrast,\nfor the finite-horizon case, it can be addressed via an augmented-state MDP. We\nprove the optimality of deterministic stationary policies for steady-state VaR\nMDPs and deterministic history-dependent policies for finite-horizon VaR MDPs.\nWe derive both a policy improvement rule and a necessary-sufficient condition\nfor optimal policies. Furthermore, we develop policy iteration type algorithms\nto maximize the VaR in MDPs and prove their convergence. Our results are also\nextended to the counterpart of VaR minimization MDPs after appropriate\nmodifications. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the\ncomputational efficiency and practical applicability of our approach.

Secondly, we show that for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there is $C > 0$ so\nthat every $(n,d,\\lambda)$-graph with $d/\\lambda \\ge C$ contains at least\n$(\\tfrac12 - \\varepsilon)d$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles, and, finally, we\nprove that the entire edge set of $G$ can be covered by no more than $(\\tfrac12\n+ \\varepsilon)d$ such cycles. All bounds are asymptotically optimal and\nsignificantly improve earlier results on Hamiltonian resilience, packing, and\ncovering in sparse pseudorandom graphs."}

Instead\nof learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the\noptimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach\ndevises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the\nmethod predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a\nsurrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation\nmethod. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping\nbetween the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space\ndetermined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the\nparametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional\nrepresentation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an\neducated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the\nintermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing\nequations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential\nerrors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the\ndesign in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.\nDifferent architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation\ncapabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The\nquasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by\nreducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\\%$ while\nachieving discrepancies below $4\\%$ in the optimal value of the objective\nfunctional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to\nextrapolate beyond the training and validation domain."}

Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This\nmatches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.\n(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other\nparameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For\ninfinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we\npropose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to\nwhich our quantum algorithms have $\\operatorname{poly}\\log{T}$ regret,\nexponentially better compared to classical algorithms.
