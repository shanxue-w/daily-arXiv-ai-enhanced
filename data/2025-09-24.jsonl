The low-rank assumption is key in establishing\na relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The\nlow-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical\noptimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly\n(in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization\napproach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study\nprobabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform\nobservations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern\nexhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient\nalgorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging\nthis structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra\noperations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of\n``fiber-wise\" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a\nsingle specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the\nusual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is\nrelevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a\nspecific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is\nguaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation\npattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications\nand use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Cross$^2$-DEIM is an iterative method that uses a fiber\nsampling strategy, sampling $O(r)$ fibers in each mode, where $r$ denotes the\ntarget rank. The fibers are selected based on the discrete empirical\ninterpolation method (DEIM). Cross$^2$-DEIM resemblances the Fiber Sampling\nTucker Decomposition (FSTD)2 approximation, and has favorable computational\nscaling compared to existing methods in the literature. We demonstrate good\nperformance of Cross$^2$-DEIM in terms of iteration count and intermediate\nmemory. First we design a fast direct Poisson solver based on Cross$^2$-DEIM\nand the fast Fourier transform. This solver can be used as a stand alone or as\na preconditioner for low-rank solvers for elliptic problems.\n  The second method is a low-rank solver for nonlinear tensor equation in\nTucker format by Anderson acceleration (AA), which we call Tucker-AA. Tucker-AA\nis an extension of low-rank AA (lrAA) proposed in our prior work for low-rank\nsolution to nonlinear matrix equation. We apply Cross$^2$-DEIM with warm-start\nin Tucker-AA to deal with the nonlinearity in the equation. We apply low-rank\noperations in AA, and by an appropriate rank truncation strategy, we are able\nto control the intermediate rank growth. We demonstrated the performance for\nTucker-AA for approximate solutions nonlinear PDEs in 3D."}

Different from that driver rough path is of level\n2, now the driver path comes from an anisotropic rough path that is lifted from\nthe mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter in $(1/4,1/3)$.\nUnlike the situation of level 2, it requires showing that the translation of\nmixed FBM in the direction of Cameron-Martin space can still be lifted to a\ngeometric rough path. Firstly, we give the large deviation for the single-time\nscale system with level 3 random geometric rough path. We still utilize the\nvariational representation and weak convergence method. However, the existence\nof third-level rough paths still makes the weak convergence analysis more\ncomplicated, where more elaborate controlled rough path calculations are\nneeded. Besides, we also give the moderate deviation within more necessary\nassumptions. Different from large deviation, some boundedness result of the\ndeviation component is required. Then, we extend the large deviation for the\nslow-fast system with level 3 random geometric rough path. To this end, we show\nthat the controlled slow component weakly converges to the solution to the\nskeleton equation by averaging to the invariant measure of the fast equation\nand exploiting the continuity of the solution mapping. Here, the solution to\nthe skeleton equation still could be well-defined in the Young sense within a\nvariational setting."}

Therefore, the\nidentification of drivers and the accurate forecasting of SP are essential for\nmarket participants to design effective hedging strategies. This paper develops\na systematic framework that combines interpretable drivers analysis with robust\nforecasting methods. It proposes an interpretable feature engineering algorithm\nto identify the main drivers of the Nordic SP based on a novel combination of\nK-means clustering, Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (MSTD), and Seasonal\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Then, it applies\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) to the identified data matrix, which is\nadapted to the downstream task of price forecasting to mitigate the issue of\nimperfect multicollinearity in the data. Finally, we propose a multi-forecast\nselection-shrinkage algorithm for Nordic SP forecasting, which selects a subset\nof complementary forecast models based on their bias-variance tradeoff at the\nensemble level and then computes the optimal weights for the retained forecast\nmodels to minimize the error variance of the combined forecast. Using\nhistorical data from the Nordic electricity market, we demonstrate that the\nproposed approach outperforms individual input models uniformly, robustly, and\nsignificantly, while maintaining a comparable computational cost.

However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift\nis absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and\nheat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift\ninto EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation\nof the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is\nproportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous\nwork, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite\ndifference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the\nstochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are\ninherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise,\nwith the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from,\nwhich introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the\nnoise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that\na PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case\nof a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the\nelectric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need\nfor a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method\nand the noise robustness with a test case."}

Spectrum extension (SE) combined with\nFDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper\nconsiders FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible\npower ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier\ncoefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show\nthat there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for\nincreasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely\ndepend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the\nbandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the\nconstellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on\nthe SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink\ncoverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually\nconfigured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality."}

The Primary User (PU) has prioritized transmissions and its\noccupancy on each channel over time can be modeled as a Markov chain. The\nSecondary User (SU) needs to determine which channels are free at each\ntime-slot and attempt opportunistic transmissions. The goal of the SU is to\nmaximize its own throughput, while simultaneously minimizing collisions with\nthe PU, and satisfying spectrum access constraints. To solve this problem, we\nfirst decouple the multiple-channel problem into N single-channel problems. For\neach decoupled problem, we prove that there exists an optimal threshold policy\nthat depends on the last observed PU occupancy and the freshness of this\noccupancy information. Second, we establish the indexability of the decoupled\nproblems by analyzing the structure of the optimal threshold policy. Using this\nstructure, we derive a Whittle index-based scheduling policy that allocates SU\ntransmissions using the Age of Information (AoI) of accessed channels. We also\nextend our insights to PU occupancy models that are correlated across channels\nand incorporate learning of unknown Markov transition matrices into our\npolicies.

For example, if\n$A$ has Riemannian volume 1 and its boundary has surface measure $|\\partial\nA|$, and $B=A$, then if $d=3$ then ${\\bf P}[n\\pi R_n^3 - \\log n - 2 \\log (\\log\nn) \\leq x]$ converges to $\\exp(-2^{-4}\\pi^{5/3} |\\partial A| e^{-2 x/3})$ and\n$(n \\pi R_n^3)/(\\log n) \\to 1$ almost surely, while if $d=2$ then ${\\bf P}[n\n\\pi R_n^2 - \\log n - \\log (\\log n) \\leq x]$ converges to $\\exp(- e^{-x}-\n|\\partial A|\\pi^{-1/2} e^{-x/2})$.\n  We generalize to allow for multiple coverage. For the strong laws of large\nnumbers, we can relax the requirement that the underlying density on $A$ be\nuniform. For the limiting distribution, we have a similar result for Poisson\nsamples. Our results still hold if we use Euclidean rather than geodetic balls."}

Existing analysis of\nPMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation\nvia Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this\npaper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation\n(TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the\ndimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any\nconstant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new\nmonotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension\nfree $\\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided\nthe step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD\n(i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence\nin the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact\nsetting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate\n$\\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last\niterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\\gamma)$."}

We announce the first public release\nof CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and\nSchreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles\nmuch larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.\n  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier\ngraphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric\ngroups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of\nquadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is\na general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem\nbeing NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on\ndiameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to\nprevious O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to\ninvolutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the\ndiameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an\nanswer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs\ngenerated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.\n  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results\non upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of\ndiameter on p. Moreover.\n  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems\nverifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created\nmore than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or\nmatrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth\ncomputation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size."}

We show that the major\npartial (positive) results on the bunkbed conjecture can also be proved for all\nrandom cluster measures, including the results for complete graphs, complete\nbipartite graphs, and the case when $p \\uparrow 1$.\n  The arboreal gas measure for forests is another limit of the random cluster\nmeasure for which we conjecture the inequality to be true and provide proofs in\nspecial cases.

In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this\nsystem-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)\". These\ncombined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies,\nboth structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies.\nThis work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to\nanalyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the\nsystem. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and\ntheir behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More\nspecifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation\nmodel of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation\nand development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the\nstate estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment\ninto the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and\nmodel-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted\nLeast Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE)\noptimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and\nenergy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation\nmethods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers\nthe mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level\ngranularity."}

A\ncover by left ideals of $R$ is a collection of proper left ideals whose\nset-theoretic union equals $R$. If such a cover exists, we define the left\nideal covering number $\\eta_\\ell(R)$ to be the cardinality of a minimal cover,\nand we also define $R$ to be $\\eta_\\ell$-elementary if $\\eta_\\ell(R) <\n\\eta_\\ell(R/I)$ for every nonzero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$. Similarly, we can\ndefine analogous notions for covers by right ideals $\\eta_r(R)$ and two-sided\nideals $\\eta(R)$. In this paper, we classify all $\\eta_\\ell$-, $\\eta_r$-, and\n$\\eta$-elementary rings, and determine their corresponding ideal covering\nnumbers. Since any ring $R$ that admits a finite cover by left ideals has an\n$\\eta_\\ell$-elementary residue ring $R/I$ such that $\\eta_\\ell(R) =\n\\eta_\\ell(R/I)$, this completely characterizes such rings and their ideal\ncovering numbers, and likewise for rings coverable by right or two-sided\nideals."}

The\nmain goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory\nperformance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture\nclosed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance\nguarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based\nmeasures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions\nto bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with\na common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive\nsuboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the\nasymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We\nfurther provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain\nstabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we\nobserve that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of\ntask heterogeneity dramatically."}
