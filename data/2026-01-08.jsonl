Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings."}

Such high compression, in turn, enables efficient high-dimensional computations. Exact TT representations are only available for simple analytic functions. Furthermore, global polynomial or Fourier expansions typically yield TT-ranks that grow proportionally with the number of basis terms. State-of-the-art methods are often prohibitively expensive or fail to recover the underlying low-rank structure. We propose a low-rank TT interpolation framework that, given a TT describing a discrete (scalar-, vector-, or tensor-valued) function on a coarse regular grid with $n$ cores, constructs a finer-scale version of the same function represented by a TT with $n+m$ cores, where the last $m$ cores maintain constant rank. Our method guarantees a $\\ell^{2}$-norm error bound independent of the total number of cores, achieves exponential compression at fixed accuracy, and admits logarithmic complexity with respect of the number of grid points. We validate its performance through numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D applications such as: 2D and 3D airfoil mask embeddings, image super-resolution, and synthetic noise fields such as 3D synthetic turbulence. In particular, we generate fractal noise fields directly in TT format with logarithmic complexity and memory. This work opens a path to scalable TT-native solvers with complex geometries and multiscale generative models, with implications from scientific simulation to imaging and real-time graphics."}

All comments are welcome", "summary": "Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory."}

To this end, we study a tracking-type functional and a two-material Poisson problem in one spatial dimension. We consider the discretization by a standard method and an enriched method. In the standard method we use splines of degree $p$ such that we can control the smoothness of the basis functions easily, but do not take any interface location into consideration. This includes for p=1 the usual hat basis functions. In the enriched method we additionally capture the interface locations in the ansatz space by enrichment functions. For both discretization methods shape and topological sensitivity analysis is performed. It turns out that the regularity of the shape derivative depends on the regularity of the basis functions. Furthermore, for point-wise convergence of the shape derivative the interface has to be considered in the ansatz space. For the topological derivative we show that only the enriched method converges."}

A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited."}

We then focus on the smoothing problem of inferring the initial condition of linear time-invariant dynamical systems, using finitely many partial state observations. For such problems, and for a specific model order reduction method based on balanced truncation, we show that the impulse response of a certain prior-driven system is closely related to the prior-preconditioned Hessian of the inverse problem.

However, some investigations indicate that results established in differential and integral calculus do not necessarily hold true in fractional calculus. In this work we will compare various methods presented in the literature to improve the Gradient Descent Method, in terms of convergence of the method, convergence to the extreme point, and convergence rate. In general, these methods that generalize the gradient descent algorithm by replacing the gradient with a fractional-order operator are inefficient in achieving convergence to the extremum point of the objective function. To avoid these difficulties, we proposed to choose the Fractional Continuous Time algorithm to generalize the gradient method. In this approach, the convergence of the method to the extreme point of the function is guaranteed by introducing the fractional order in the time derivative, rather than in of the gradient. In this case, the issue of finding the extreme point is resolved, while the issue of stability at the equilibrium point remains.\n  Fractional Continuous Time method converges to extreme point of cost function when fractional-order is between 0 and 1. The simulations shown in this work suggests that a similar result can be found when $1 \\leq α\\leq 2$. { This paper highlights the main advantages and disadvantages of generalizations of the gradient method using fractional derivatives, aiming to optimize convergence in complex problems. Some chemical problems, with n=11 and 24 optimization parameters, are employed as means of evaluating the efficacy of the propose algorithms. In general, previous studies are restricted to mathematical questions and simple illustrative examples."}

In the complex analytic case, the Milnor fibration on the sphere is always given by the normalized map $f/|f|$. In contrast, for real analytic maps the existence of such a normalized Milnor fibration generally fails, even when a Milnor--Le fibration exists on a tube.\n  For locally surjective real analytic maps $f:(R^n,0)->(R^k,0)$ with isolated critical value, the existence of a Milnor--Le fibration on a tube is guaranteed under a transversality condition. However, the associated fibration on the sphere need not be given by the normalized map $f/||f||$, unless an additional regularity condition (d-regularity) is imposed.\n  In this paper we show that this apparent obstruction is not intrinsic. More precisely, we prove that for any such map satisfying the transversality property, there exists a homeomorphism $h:(R^k,0)->(R^k,0)$ of the target space such that the composition $h^{-1}f$ becomes d-regular. As a consequence, the normalized map $(h^{-1}f)/||h^{-1}f||$ defines a smooth locally trivial fibration on the sphere, which is equivalent to both the Milnor--Le fibration on the tube and the Milnor fibration on the sphere. Our result reveals a closer topological parallel between real and complex analytic singularities than previously recognized, without changing the topological type of the singularity."}

In this thesis, I extend the classical framework of Geometric Quantization to handle a class of singular spaces called Symplectic Stratified Spaces, which date back to the work of Sjamaar and Lerman in the 1990s. As part of this work, I develop the theory of stratified pseudobundles to serve as singular replacements for important auxiliary information in Geometric Quantization: prequantum line bundles and polarizations.

Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications."}

First, a cluster - purity theorem shows that when the support consists of well-separated components, each optimal Voronoi region remains confined to a single component. Second, a ring - allocation (discrete water - filling) theorem provides an explicit rule describing how optimal representatives are distributed across multiple latitudinal rings, together with closed-form distortion formulas.

In this thesis, I extend the classical framework of Geometric Quantization to handle a class of singular spaces called Symplectic Stratified Spaces, which date back to the work of Sjamaar and Lerman in the 1990s. As part of this work, I develop the theory of stratified pseudobundles to serve as singular replacements for important auxiliary information in Geometric Quantization: prequantum line bundles and polarizations.

By distinguishing between \"injection-limited\" and \"bulk-limited\" transport, we identify a novel universality class of extreme value statistics that arises in geometries dominated by source traps (e.g., the Comet graph). In this regime, the distribution of the minimum arrival time does not converge to any of the classical generalized extreme value distributions. Instead, it follows a discrete, hard-edge distribution determined by the properties of the source. We analytically derive the asymptotic behavior of this class and validate our predictions against Monte Carlo simulations. Crucially, we identify the mechanism of \"entropic collapse\" that destroys this scaling in bulk-dominated geometries like the Bethe lattice, where the phase space of delayed paths diverges with distance. This work establishes a rigorous topological condition -- the invariance of the entropic penalty for detours -- that separates quantum-like, discrete extreme value statistics from classical bulk transport limits."}

In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $ψ(t)=t^α/α$ and prove that every $C_0$--$α$-semigroup $\\{T_α(t)\\}_{t\\ge0}$ can be written as $T_α(t)=T(ψ(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\\{T(s)\\}_{s\\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $α$-hypercyclicity and $α$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,α}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time."}

A key result is the scheme--theoretic residue span theorem, which asserts that %\nfor nodal curves of geometric genus $g$ with $δ$ nodes, when $δ\\ge g$ the residue functionals at the nodes span $H^0(C,ω_C)^\\vee$, so canonical differentials are completely determined by their residue data.

This equivalence clarifies the local--to--global structure of dualizing sheaves and extends naturally to $k$--differentials. Finally, we address the case of arbitrary singularities, where nodes no longer suffice to describe local geometry.

We integrate gradient-tracking techniques with gradient clipping and carefully design the clipping threshold to ensure accurate convergence over directed communication graphs under generalized smoothness.

Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting.

Linearization about an arbitrarily large finite deformation yields incremental bulk and surface balance laws that closely resemble the classical small-on-large theory, but are now extended to include surface-curvatureinduced stresses. The applicability of the general theory is demonstrated by analyzing the onset of periodic beading in a soft cylindrical substrate coated with a surface layer exhibiting stretching- or curvature-dependent behavior, illustrating how surface stretching and bending effects influence instability thresholds for both compressible and incompressible bulk. This unified formulation thus provides a foundation for studying stability phenomena in elasto-capillary systems where surface curvature plays a critical mechanical role."}

First we review and relate the use of local spectral problems in distinct fields of literature on AMG, domain decomposition (DD), and multiscale finite elements. We then propose a new approach blending aggregation-based coarsening, overlapping Schwarz smoothers, and locally constructed spectral coarse spaces. By exploiting the factorized structure of $A$, we construct an inexpensive symmetric positive semidefinite splitting that yields local generalized eigenproblems whose solutions define sparse, nonoverlapping coarse basis functions. This enables a fully algebraic and naturally recursive multilevel hierarchy that can either coarsen slowly to achieve AMG-like operator complexities, or coarsen aggressively-with correspondingly larger local spectral problems-to ensure robustness on problems that cannot be solved by existing AMG methods. The method requires no geometric information, avoids global eigenvalue solves, and maintains efficient parallelizable setup through localized operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed least-squares AMG-DD method achieves convergence rates independent of anisotropy on rotated diffusion problems and remains scalable with problem size, while for small amounts of anisotropy we obtain convergence and operator complexities comparable with classical AMG methods. Most notably, for extremely anisotropic heat conduction operators arising in magnetic confinement fusion, where AMG and smoothed aggregation fail to reduce the residual even marginally, our method provides robust and efficient convergence across many orders of magnitude in anisotropy strength."}

In such systems, agents interact through weighted graphs whose structure evolves over time in a coupled manner with the agents' states, leading to non-exchangeable dynamics. In the dense-graph regime, we show that the asymptotic behavior is described by a Vlasov-type equation posed on an extended phase space that includes both the agents' states and identities and the evolving interaction weights. We establish this limiting equation through two complementary approaches. The first follows the mean-field methodology in the spirit of Sznitman [28]. In this framework, we impose the additional assumption that the weight dynamics is independent of one of the agent's states, an assumption that remains well motivated from a modeling perspective and allows for a direct derivation of the mean-field limit. The second approach is based on the graph limit framework and is formulated in a deterministic setting. This perspective makes it possible to remove the aforementioned restriction on the weight dynamics and to handle more general interaction structures. Our analysis includes wellposedness and stability results for the limiting Vlasov-type equation, as well as quantitative estimates ensuring the propagation of independence. We further clarify the relationship between the continuum (graph limit) formulation and the mean-field limit, thereby providing a unified description of the asymptotic dynamics of interacting particle systems on adaptive dynamical networks."}

Between these extremes, sparse pendant patterns produce intermediate behavior: removing endpoint pendants gives zeta = 2^(gamma - 2), while alternating pendant attachments induce Fibonacci growth zeta asymptotic to phi^gamma, where phi is the golden ratio. For complete binary trees T_h, we establish a rigid period-3 law zeta(T_h) in {1, 3} despite exponential growth in |V(T_h)|. We further prove a sharp stability bound under leaf deletions, zeta(T_h - X) <= 2^{m_1(X)} zeta(T_h), where m_1(X) counts parents that lose exactly one child; in particular, deleting a single leaf preserves the domination number and exactly doubles the dominion."}

To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs."}

This fills in some missing parts of Magid's paper [5].\n  We also discuss exact sequences $1 \\to N \\to G \\to H \\to 1$, where $G = Aut(K_{2}/K)$, $N = Aut(K_{2}/K_{1})$ and $H = Aut(K_{1}/K)$, $K_1$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K$. $K_2$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K_1$ and $K_2$ is normal over $K$ (in the differential closure of $K$) and again $C_K$ is algebraically closed. Both $N$ and $H$ have the structure of proalgebraic groups over $C_K$. We show that conjugation by any given element of $G$ is a proalgebraic automorphism of $N$. Moreover if $G$ splits as a semidirect product $N\\rtimes H$, then left multiplication by any fixed element of $G$ is a morphism of proalgebraic varieties $N\\times H \\to N\\times H$. This improves and extends observations in Section 4 of [5] which dealt with one particular example."}

Existing approaches either delay inference until fixed statistical thresholds are met -- leading to user disengagement -- or surface heuristic insights without formal uncertainty quantification, risking false confidence. We propose a progressive Bayesian confidence architecture that formalizes early-stage inference through phased interpretation of posterior uncertainty. Drawing on Bayesian updating and epistemic strategies from financial risk modeling under sparse observations, we map posterior contraction to interpretable tiers of insight, ranging from exploratory directional evidence to robust associative inference. We demonstrate the framework's performance through controlled experimentation with synthetic N-of-1 health data, showing that calibrated early insights can be generated within 5--7 days while maintaining explicit epistemic humility. Compared to fixed-threshold baselines requiring 30+ days of data, the proposed approach yields earlier directional signals (mean: 5.3 vs 31.7 days, p<0.001) while controlling false discovery rates below 6% (5.9% at day 30) despite 26-day earlier detection, compared to 0% FDR for fixed-threshold baselines that delay insights by 30 days. In addition, we show strong uncertainty calibration (76% credible interval coverage for ground-truth correlations at day 90). This work contributes a methodological framework for uncertainty-aware early inference in personalized health analytics that bridges the gap between user engagement requirements and statistical rigor."}

In sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case, where $(-1)$-homogeneous vector fields are locally square-integrable, the 2D problem is critical in the sense that the initial kinetic energy is locally infinite at the origin, and the initial vorticity fails to be locally integrable. Consequently, the classical local energy estimates are not available. To overcome this, we decompose the solution into a linear part solving the heat equation and a finite-energy perturbation part. By exploiting a kind of inherent cancellation relation between the linear part and the perturbation part, we can control interaction terms and establish the $H^1$-estimates for the perturbation part. Further investigating the corresponding Leray system in weighted Sobolev space, we can derive an optimal pointwise estimate.

However, the large amount of connected devices prevents the use of orthogonal pilot sequences, resulting in severe pilot contamination (PC) that degrades channel estimation and data detection performance. Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors."}

This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions.

We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty."}

Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system for the Sommerfeld transforms $Q(ζ)$ and $S(ζ)$. In this special configuration the associated Snell surface is the lemniscatic curve $Y^2=2(t^4+1)$, uniformized by the square Weierstrass lattice $τ=i$. We solve the resulting orbit Wiener-Hopf/Riemann-Hilbert system on the torus and obtain an exact closed-form expression for the scattered transform $Q_{\\rm scat}$ as a finite Weierstrass-zeta sum plus an explicitly constructed pole-free elliptic remainder. All pole coefficients are computed algebraically from the forcing pole set, and the construction enforces analyticity at the incident spectral point. We also reconstruct the face transform $S$ and, under standard analyticity and growth hypotheses on the Sommerfeld densities, verify the transmission conditions on both wedge faces, the Sommerfeld radiation condition, and the Meixner edge condition.

Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting.

We also prove that our $g=1$ intersection numbers satisfy a $g=1$ recursion, also predicted in [7,15].

Much recent research has focused on the development of sufficient conditions for exact solution of the densest submatrix problem via convex relaxation.

To obtain candidates for local minima, we want to solve the first order optimality system via Newton's method. This requires the initial guess to be sufficiently close to the a priori unknown solution. Introducing a stepsize rule often allows for less restrictions on the initial guess while still preserving convergence. In topology optimization one typically encounters nonconvex problems where this approach might fail. We therefore opt for a homotopy (continuation) approach which is based on solving a sequence of parametrized problems to approach the solution of the original problem. In the density based framework the values of the design variable are constrained by 0 from below and 1 from above. Coupling the homotopy method with a barrier strategy enforces these constraints to be satisified. The numerical results for a PDE-constrained compliance minimization problem demonstrate that this combined approach maintains feasibility of the density function and converges to a (candidate for a) locally optimal design without a priori knowledge of the solution."}

In the complex analytic case, the Milnor fibration on the sphere is always given by the normalized map $f/|f|$. In contrast, for real analytic maps the existence of such a normalized Milnor fibration generally fails, even when a Milnor--Le fibration exists on a tube.\n  For locally surjective real analytic maps $f:(R^n,0)->(R^k,0)$ with isolated critical value, the existence of a Milnor--Le fibration on a tube is guaranteed under a transversality condition. However, the associated fibration on the sphere need not be given by the normalized map $f/||f||$, unless an additional regularity condition (d-regularity) is imposed.\n  In this paper we show that this apparent obstruction is not intrinsic. More precisely, we prove that for any such map satisfying the transversality property, there exists a homeomorphism $h:(R^k,0)->(R^k,0)$ of the target space such that the composition $h^{-1}f$ becomes d-regular. As a consequence, the normalized map $(h^{-1}f)/||h^{-1}f||$ defines a smooth locally trivial fibration on the sphere, which is equivalent to both the Milnor--Le fibration on the tube and the Milnor fibration on the sphere.

We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency.

However, some investigations indicate that results established in differential and integral calculus do not necessarily hold true in fractional calculus. In this work we will compare various methods presented in the literature to improve the Gradient Descent Method, in terms of convergence of the method, convergence to the extreme point, and convergence rate. In general, these methods that generalize the gradient descent algorithm by replacing the gradient with a fractional-order operator are inefficient in achieving convergence to the extremum point of the objective function. To avoid these difficulties, we proposed to choose the Fractional Continuous Time algorithm to generalize the gradient method. In this approach, the convergence of the method to the extreme point of the function is guaranteed by introducing the fractional order in the time derivative, rather than in of the gradient. In this case, the issue of finding the extreme point is resolved, while the issue of stability at the equilibrium point remains.\n  Fractional Continuous Time method converges to extreme point of cost function when fractional-order is between 0 and 1.

Three documented events (2014, 2017, 2020) were simulated using WRF downscaling of ERA reanalyses and validated with tide-gauge and microbarograph observations. Both models are limited by the underestimation of mesoscale pressure disturbances in the atmospheric forcing.

Under this equivalence, we find that the word length filtration of quantum shuffle algebras as defined in Ellenberg-Tran-Westerland corresponds to the codimension filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves. Furthermore, we find that the geometric weight filtration of factorizable perverse sheaves corresponds to a filtration on quantum shuffle algebras which has not been previously defined in the literature, and we call this the algebraic weight filtration. To apply this to Hurwitz spaces, we prove a comparison theorem between the weight filtrations for Hurwitz spaces over $\\mathbb F_p$ and $\\mathbb C$, generalizing the comparison theorem of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland. This allows us to determine the cohomological weights for Hurwitz spaces explicitly using the algebraic weight filtration of the corresponding quantum shuffle algebra. As a consequence, we find that most weights of Hurwitz spaces are smaller than expected from cohomological degree, and we prove explicit nontrivial upper bounds for weights in some cases, such as when $G=S_3$ and $c$ is the conjugacy class of transpositions."}

This survey reviews progress across six key areas: transformer-based models, contrastive learning, domain-focused solutions, multi-modal methods, graph-based approaches, and knowledge-enhanced techniques. Recent transformer models such as FarSSiBERT and DeBERTa-v3 have achieved remarkable accuracy, while contrastive methods like AspectCSE have established new benchmarks. Domain-adapted models, including CXR-BERT for medical texts and Financial-STS for finance, demonstrate how STS can be effectively customized for specialized fields. Moreover, multi-modal, graph-based, and knowledge-integrated models further enhance semantic understanding and representation. By organizing and analyzing these developments, the survey provides valuable insights into current methods, practical applications, and remaining challenges. It aims to guide researchers and practitioners alike in navigating rapid advancements, highlighting emerging trends and future opportunities in the evolving field of STS."}

We capture this common mechanism by defining strip-symmetric biased codes, a class of static stabilizer and dynamical (Floquet) codes for which, under pure dephasing and perfect measurements, each elementary $Z$ fault is confined to a strip and the Z-detector--fault incidence matrix is block diagonal. For such codes the Z-detector hypergraph decomposes into independent strip components and maximum-likelihood $Z$ decoding factorizes across strips, yielding complexity savings for matching-based decoders.

The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework of Eynard et.al. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten.

Marginals are coupled via a Gaussian copula to construct joint distributions. To address the computational bottleneck of the high-dimensional integration required to solve the option pricing formula, we employ Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) techniques based on Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), achieving quadratic convergence improvements over classical Monte Carlo (CMC) methods. Theoretical results establish accuracy bounds and query complexity for both marginal density estimation (via cosine-series expansions) and multidimensional pricing. Empirical tests on liquid equity entities (Credit Agricole, AXA, Michelin) confirm high calibration accuracy and demonstrate that QAMC requires 10-100 times fewer queries than classical methods for comparable precision. This study provides a practical route to integrate arbitrage-aware modelling with quantum computing, highlighting implications for scalability and future extensions to complex derivatives."}

In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $ψ(t)=t^α/α$ and prove that every $C_0$--$α$-semigroup $\\{T_α(t)\\}_{t\\ge0}$ can be written as $T_α(t)=T(ψ(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\\{T(s)\\}_{s\\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $α$-hypercyclicity and $α$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,α}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time."}

This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions. Unlike previous Lyapunov-based methods that mainly rely on quadratic functions, our method utilizes polyhedral functions to enhance accuracy in managing uncertainties within value iteration of dynamic programming. We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty."}

Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation."}

Standard approaches typically rely on mixed-integer programming, which introduces scalability challenges and requires specialized solvers. This paper presents an exact reformulation of broad classes of logical constraints as binary-variable-free expressions whose differentiability properties coincide with those of the underlying predicates, enabling their direct integration into nonlinear programming models. Our approach rewrites arbitrary logical propositions into conjunctive normal form, converts them into equivalent max--min constraints, and applies a smoothing procedure that preserves the exact feasible set. The method is evaluated on two benchmark problems, a quadrotor trajectory optimization with obstacle avoidance and a hybrid two-tank system with temporal logic constraints, and is shown to obtain optimal solutions more consistently and efficiently than existing binary variable elimination techniques."}

Differential Equ.), Lou proved that, once the intrinsic growth rate $r$ in the logistic model is proportional to the spatially heterogeneous carrying capacity $K$ ($r=K^1$), the total population under the regular diffusion exceeds the total of the carrying capacity. He also conjectured that the dependency of the total population on the diffusion coefficient is unimodal, increasing to its maximum and then decreasing to the asymptote which is the total of the carrying capacity. DeAngelis et al (J. Math. Biol. 2016) argued that the prevalence of the population over the carrying capacity is only observed when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are positively correlated, at least for slow dispersal. Guo et al (J. Math. Biol. 2020) justified that, once $r$ is constant ($r=K^0$), the total population is less than the cumulative carrying capacity. Our paper fills up the gap for when $r=K^λ$ for any real $λ$, disproving an assumption that there is a critical $λ^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$ at which the tendency of the prevalence of the carrying capacity over the total population size changes, demonstrating instead that the relationship is more complicated. In addition, we explore the dependency of the total population size on the diffusion coefficient when the third parameter of the dispersal strategy $P$ is involved: the diffusion term is $d Δ(u/P)$, not just $d Δu$, for any $λ$. We outline some differences from the random diffusion case, in particular, concerning the profile of the total population as a function of the diffusion coefficient."}

All comments are welcome", "summary": "Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory."}

In the standard method we use splines of degree $p$ such that we can control the smoothness of the basis functions easily, but do not take any interface location into consideration. This includes for p=1 the usual hat basis functions. In the enriched method we additionally capture the interface locations in the ansatz space by enrichment functions. For both discretization methods shape and topological sensitivity analysis is performed. It turns out that the regularity of the shape derivative depends on the regularity of the basis functions.
