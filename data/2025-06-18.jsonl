Since a selection method of initial value affects the convergence of the solution, developing an effective method to find an initial guess is required. In this work, Bézier curves, which can describe complicated curves and surfaces, are utilized to find the initial guess. First, the given problems are transformed into Bézier curves forms, and Bézier curves' control points, which can handle the shape of curves, are selected by solving the system of nonlinear equations. Finally, the initial guess is obtained by substituting the calculated control points to Bézier curves. To validate the performance of the proposed method, numerical simulations are conducted with respect to three kinds of orbits, which are from circular to highly elliptical orbit (HEO). The proposed method is compared to the general shooting method. The comparison results show that the initial guess calculated by Bézier curves makes finding the solution more efficient in terms of computational time and iterations.

These factors make traditional system design methods impractical for FAS due to nonconvexity and prohibitive computational complexity. While deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed for MIMO optimization, their limited generalization and fitting capabilities render them suboptimal for FAS.

The approach of this paper employs a polynomial approximation of the right-hand side vector field of the differential equations and leads to the following important outcomes. First, the first-order optimality conditions of the LGL integral form are derived, which lead to a full-rank transformed adjoint system and novel costate estimate. Next, a derivative-like form of the LGL collocation method is obtained by multiplying the system by the inverse of an appropriate full-rank block of the integration matrix. The first-order optimality conditions of the LGL derivative-like form are then derived, leading to an equivalent full-rank transformed adjoint system and secondary novel costate estimate which is related to the costate estimate of the integral form via a linear transformation. Then, it is shown that a second integral form can be constructed by including an additional noncollocated support point, but such a point is superfluous and has no impact on the solution to the nonlinear programming problem. Finally, the method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems: a one-dimensional initial value optimal control problem with an analytic solution and a time-variant orbit raising optimal control problem."}

Upon Kinyon's observation made in 2018 that $F$-inverse monoids form a variety in the enriched signature involving an additional unary operation mapping each element of $M$ to the maximum element of its $σ$-class, a separate theory of $F$-inverse monoids is developing in recent years, greatly aided by a recent solution to the long-standing problem of Henckell and Rhodes on finite $F$-inverse covers of finite inverse monoids. In particular, a description of the universal object $F(G,X)$ in the class of $X$-generated $F$-inverse monoids with a prescribed maximum group image was provided recently. In this paper we introduce yet another object $M_F(G,X)$, the one that is universal for inverse monoids (so, not in the enriched signature) that are $X$-generated with maximum group image a quotient of $G$ and which happen to be $F$-inverse. We obtain presentations and geometric models based on Cayley graphs of groups for such inverse monoids. As an application, we are able to characterise all one-relator special inverse monoids $\\mathrm{Inv}\\langle{X}\\,|\\,{w=1}\\rangle$ with a cyclically reduced relator word $w$ enjoying the $F$-inverse property."}

This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \\romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \\romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case.

All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, Möbius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundhöfer)."}

For numerical approximation, we employ the Newmark method for time discretization of the hyperbolic term and a continuous interior penalty scheme for the spatial discretization of displacement. For the parabolic equations that represent the first moments of temperature and chemical potential (resp. pore pressure), we use the Crank--Nicolson method for time discretization and conforming finite elements for spatial discretization. The convergence of the fully discrete scheme with quasi-optimal rates in space and time is established. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the 2D Kirchhoff--Love plate model in capturing thermoelastic diffusion and thermo-poroelastic behavior in specific materials.

The concept of shared charging offers a promising solution. The paper explores sustainable urban logistics through horizontal collaboration between two fleet operators and addresses a scheduling problem for the shared use of charging stations. To tackle this, the study formulates a collaborative scheduling problem as a bi-objective nonlinear integer programming model, in which each company aims to minimize its own costs, creating inherent conflicts that require trade-offs. The Balanced Bounding Box Methods (B3Ms) are introduced in order to efficiently derive the efficient frontier, identifying a reduced set of representative solutions. These methods enhance computational efficiency by selectively disregarding closely positioned and competing solutions, preserving the diversity and representativeness of the solutions over the efficient frontier. To determine the final solution and ensure balanced collaboration, cooperative bargaining methods are applied. Numerical case studies demonstrate the viability and scalability of the developed methods, showing that the B3Ms can significantly reduce computational time while maintaining the integrity of the frontier. These methods, along with cooperative bargaining, provide an effective framework for solving various bi-objective optimization problems, extending beyond the collaborative scheduling problem presented here."}

We study the larger class of Lorentz-entanglement breaking maps where $K$ is restricted to be a Lorentz cone of any dimension, i.e., any cone over a Euclidean ball. This class of maps appeared recently in the study of asymptotic entanglement annihilation and it is dual to the linear maps factoring through Lorentz cones. Our main results establish connections between these classes of maps and operator ideals studied in the theory of Banach spaces. For operators $u:X\\rightarrow Y$ between finite-dimensional normed spaces $X$ and $Y$ we consider so-called central maps which are positive with respect to the cones $C_A=C_X$ and $C_B=C_Y$. We show how to characterize when such a map factors through a Lorentz cone and when it is Lorentz-entanglement breaking by using the Hilbert-space factorization norm $γ_2$ and its dual $γ^*_2$.

We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals.

Mutations and recombinations that reduce the distance to an optimum are considered as beneficial. Geometric and combinatorial analysis is used to derive closed-form expressions for transition probabilities between spheres around an optimum giving a complete description of Markov evolution of distances from an optimum over multiple generations. This paves the way for optimization of parameters of mutation and recombination operators. Here we derive optimality conditions for mutation and recombination radii maximizing the probabilities of mutation and crossover into the optimum. The analysis highlights important differences between these evolutionary operators. While mutation can potentially reach any part of the search space, the probability of beneficial mutation decreases with distance to an optimum, and the optimal mutation radius or rate should also decrease resulting in a slow-down of evolution near the optimum. Crossover recombination, on the other hand, acts in a subspace of the search space defined by the current population of strings. However, probabilities of beneficial and deleterious crossover are balanced, and their characteristics, such as variance, are translation invariant in a Hamming space, suggesting that recombination may complement mutation and boost the rate of evolution near the optimum."}

All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword.

The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available.

Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically \\highlight{prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features} when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model.

We address this gap by providing comprehensive proofs. First, we prove a sufficient condition for a robust L2O model with homogeneous convergence rates over all In-Distribution (InD) instances. We assume an L2O model achieves robustness for an InD scenario.

However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound.

The standard causal inference methodology is not designed for this type of inference since the events of interest may be scarce in the observed data and some degree of extrapolation is necessary. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides methodologies for analyzing statistical phenomena in such extreme regimes. We introduce a novel framework for assessing treatment effects in extreme data to capture the causal effect at the occurrence of rare events of interest. In particular, we employ the theory of multivariate regular variation to model extremities. We develop a consistent estimator for extreme treatment effects and present a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of its performance. We illustrate the performance of our estimator using both synthetic and semi-synthetic data."}

However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution."}

The second half of the paper reviews his research on wind blown sand and hyperbolic distributions and processes, including his early contributions to modelling of turbulent wind fields.

Key features of FTheoryTools include the enumeration of G4-fluxes, the capability to perform blowups on arbitrary (including non-toric) loci, and a literature database of existing F-theory constructions employing a MaRDI-based data format for enhanced collaboration and reproducibility. As a demonstration of its power, we present a stress test by applying FTheoryTools to the challenging F-theory geometry with most flux vacua (arXiv:1511.03209).

This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question.

Gröbner bases have doubly exponential computational complexity (for this case, $7^{2^{1023}}$ operations); we exploit symmetry and multigrading to render the computation tractable.

To address this limitation, different approaches have been studied, such as the Forest of Trees method and the BUcket Sampling (BUS) method. However, all previous methods suffered from numerical issues which can bias the sampling process. In this paper, we describe EBUS (Exact BUcket Sampling), the first exact algorithm with $O(1)$ sampling and update cost.

Allen, B{ö}ttcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined the chromatic threshold for every $H$; in particular, they showed that if $χ(H)=r\\ge 3$, then $δ_χ(H) \\in\\{\\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\\frac{r-2}{r-1}\\}$. While the chromatic thresholds have been completely determined, rather surprisingly the structural behaviors of extremal graphs near the threshold remain unexplored.\n  In this paper, we establish the stability theorems for chromatic threshold problems. We prove that every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph $G$ with $δ(G)\\ge (δ_χ(H)-o(1))n$ and $χ(G)=ω(1)$ must be structurally close to one of the extremal configurations. Furthermore, we give a stronger stability result when $H$ is a clique, showing that $G$ admits a partition into independent sets and a small subgraph on sublinear number of vertices. We show that this small subgraph has fractional chromatic number $2+o(1)$ and is homomorphic to a Kneser graph defined by subsets of a logarithmic size set; both these two bounds are best possible. This is the first stability result that captures the lower-order structural features of extremal graphs.\n  We also study two variations of chromatic thresholds. Replacing chromatic number by its fractional counterpart, we determine the fractional chromatic thresholds for all graphs. Another variation is the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds, which was introduced by Liu, Shangguan, Skokan, and Xu very recently. Extending work of Łuczak and Thomass{é} on the triangle case, we determine the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds for all cliques."}

Combined with work of Ramzi--Sosnilo--Winges, our results imply that there exists a stable infinity-category C such that THH(C), TR(C), and TC(C) realize the relevant logarithmic term for specific log structures, such as the natural ones on discrete valuation rings, connective complex K-theory, and truncated Brown--Peterson spectra.

It resulted in the lower bounds of $Ω(\\frac{2^{n/3}}{n\\sqrt{n}})$ and $Ω(\\frac{4^{n/5}}{n})$ for alphabets of two and three letters respectively, obtained by de Bondt, Don, and Zantema.

The construction uses the Heyneman-Sweedler finite dual coalgebra and the Takeuchi underlying coalgebra. When $k$ is algebraically closed, the formation of ringed coalgebras gives a fully faithful functor out of the category of fully RFD algebras, as well as a fully faithful functor out of the category of schemes locally of finite type. The restrictions of these two functors to the category of (commutative) finitely generated algebras are isomorphic. Finally, we introduce modules over ringed coalgebras and show that the category of finitely generated modules on a fully RFD algebra and that of coherent sheaves on a scheme locally of finite type can, if $k$ is algebraically closed, be fully faithfully embedded into the category of modules over the corresponding ringed coalgebras."}

In view of how state diagrams for DFAs are defined using directed graphs, this leads us to introduce a generalization of DFAs related to a method widely used in graph theory referred to as the discharging method. Given a DFA $(Q, Σ, δ, q_{0}, F)$, the transition function $δ\\colon Q \\times Σ\\to Q$ determines a directed path in the corresponding state diagram based on an input string $a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}$ consisting of characters in $Σ$, and our generalization can be thought of as being based on how each vertex in $D$ ''discharges'' rational values to adjacent vertices (by analogy with the discharging method) depending on the string $a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}$ and according to a fixed set of rules. We formalize this notion and pursue an exploration of the notion of a Discharging Deterministic Finite Automaton (DDFA) introduced in this paper. Our DDFA construction gives rise to a ring structure consisting of sequences that we refer to as being quasi-$k$-regular, and this ring generalizes the ring of $k$-regular sequences introduced by Allouche and Shallit."}
