Classical work established sufficient\nconditions, typically combining KL support with complexity bounds on sieves of\nhigh prior mass, to guarantee consistency with respect to the Hellinger\ndistance. Yet no systematic theory explains a widely held belief: under KL\nsupport, Hellinger consistency is exceptionally hard to violate. This suggests\nthat existing sufficient conditions, while useful in practice, may overlook\nsome key aspects of posterior behavior. We address this gap by directly\ninvestigating what must fail for inconsistency to arise, aiming to identify a\nsubstantive necessary condition for Hellinger inconsistency. Our starting point\nis Andrew Barron's classical counterexample, the only known violation of\nHellinger consistency under KL support, which relies on a contrived family of\noscillatory densities and a prior with atoms.

Each of the customers arriving is\nassigned at random to one of the priority classes. This assignment is\nindependent of the rest of the system and follows a fixed probability\ndistribution.\n  Using a time-change representation of a fractional Poisson process, we first\ngive a multinomial thinning decomposition: the total number of arrivals in each\nclass are independent standard Poisson processes of appropriate intensities,\ntime-changed by a common independent random clock that is the inverse of an\n$\\alpha$-stable subordinator. This yields a process-level law of large numbers\nand a functional central limit theorem for the process of arrivals.\n  For the queueing system itself, we identify process-level scaling limits for\nthe cumulative and individual queue lengths of the classes. We also prove that\nthe queue gets empty infinitely often when $\\alpha \\le \\beta$, which does\ninclude the critical case $\\alpha = \\beta$.

Inspired by a previously published virtual induction study by\nArevalo et al.

Standardization relies on the previously published forCEPSS\nframework and is ensured by defining the whole induction study with input files\nthat can be easily shared. Our approach also ensures numerical efficiency by\nseparating the induction study into four stages: (i) pre-pacing with forCEPSS,\n(ii) S1 pacing tor each steady state, (iii) S2 induction with different\nextrastimuli, (iv) testing of sustenance of induced reentries. We demonstrate\nthe approach in a large virtual subject cohort to investigate numerical\nartifacts that may arise when improper setups are provided to perform virtual\ninduction, and additionally showcase autoVARP in a biventricular mesh. AutoVARP\naddresses effectively the current gap in standardization and reproducibility of\nresults providing a uniform methodology that can be implemented even by non\nexpert users. AutoVARP is highly scalable and adaptable to markedly different\nanatomies.

This is especially true for pointer analysis, where, unless\nsignificant compromises are made in the precision of the analysis, there is a\ncombinatorial blowup of information. One of the key problems we observed in our\nown efforts is that a lot of duplicate data was being propagated, and many\nlow-level data structure operations were repeated a large number of times.\n  We present what we consider to be a novel and generic data structure,\nLatticeHashForest (LHF), to store and operate on such information in a manner\nthat eliminates a majority of redundant computations and duplicate data in\nscenarios similar to those encountered in compilers and program optimization.\nLHF differs from similar work in this vein, such as hash-consing, ZDDs, and\nBDDs, by not only providing a way to efficiently operate on large, aggregate\nstructures, but also modifying the elements of such structures in a manner that\nthey can be deduplicated immediately. LHF also provides a way to perform a\nnested construction of elements such that they can be deduplicated at multiple\nlevels, cutting down the need for additional, nested computations.\n  We provide a detailed structural description, along with an abstract model of\nthis data structure. An entire C++ implementation of LHF is provided as an\nartifact along with evaluations of LHF using examples and benchmark programs.\nWe also supply API documentation and a user manual for users to make\nindependent applications of LHF. Our main use case in the realm of pointer\nanalysis shows memory usage reduction to an almost negligible fraction, and\nspeedups beyond 4x for input sizes approaching 10 million when compared to\nother implementations."}

However, many of the current methods struggle when it\ncomes to fully embracing circular economy principles. Enhancing the design and\nmanagement of these networks holds significant potential to promote stronger\ncollaboration among supply chain partners, ultimately fostering more\nsustainable and efficient operational practices. For this purpose, this study\naddresses a new circular economy model based on a real case study of a mask SC\nin the healthcare sector in British Columbia, Canada. The objective is to show\nthat implementing circular practices can lead to considerable financial and\nenvironmental benefits, as well as the creation of new job opportunities. To\nachieve this, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is\ndeveloped to identify the most efficient trade-off among sustainable\nobjectives, while adhering to imposed constraints. The proposed closed-loop SC\nmodel outperforms the existing linear model in all three aspects of\nsustainability, namely economic, environmental and social. The improvement\nleads to significant economic and environmental benefits by preventing the\ndisposal of used masks, giving them a second chance for disinfection and\nreprocessing, and reintroducing them into the SC as new ones. While the results\nof the circular economy model demonstrate profit gains and environmental\nrecovery, the linear SC model showed negative profit with higher carbon\nemissions. Regarding the social aspects, compared to the current system, our\napproach not only nearly doubles the number of jobs created but also\nsignificantly reduces shortages, highlighting sustainable development aspects\nrelated to equity and social welfare.

There are $k$ sources broadcasting each to a subset of nodes\nin a graph of size $n$. The corresponding combinatorial problem is a version of\nthe Steiner tree packing problem, and the network coding question asks whether\nthe multicast coding rate exceeds the tree-packing rate.\n  We give the first super-constant bound to this problem, demonstrating an\nexample with a coding advantage of $\\Omega(\\log k)$.

We\ninvestigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show\nthat if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at\nmost 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound\non the size."}

Cycle-factors subject\nto parity constraints arise naturally in the study of structural graph theory\nand algorithmic complexity. In this work, we study four variants of the problem\nof finding a cycle-factor subject to parity constraints: (1) all cycles are\nodd, (2) all cycles are even, (3) at least one cycle is odd, and (4) at least\none cycle is even. These variants are considered in the undirected, directed,\nand mixed settings. We show that all but the fourth problem are NP-complete in\nall settings, while the complexity of the fourth one remains open for the\ndirected and undirected cases. We also show that in mixed graphs, even deciding\nthe existence of any cycle factor is NP-complete."}
