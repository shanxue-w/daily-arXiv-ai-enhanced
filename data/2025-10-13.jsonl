Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a\nsuitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty.\nThe available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further\nintegrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data\nfor training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented\ndatasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in\nparticular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR\napproach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing\naccurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and\navoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints\ninto the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative\npredictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system,\nmaking them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical\nsimulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region\n(Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

We also provide an overview of what we know about the\nstructure of these Bernstein blocks including a sketch of recent results of the\nauthor with Adler, Mishra and Ohara that allow to reduce a lot of problems\nabout the (category of) representations of p-adic groups to problems about\nrepresentations of finite groups of Lie type, where answers are often already\nknown or are at least easier to achieve. Moreover, we provide an overview of\nwhat is known about the construction of supercuspidal representations, which\nare the building blocks of all smooth representations and whose construction is\nalso the key to obtain the above results about the structure of the whole\ncategory of smooth representations. We will, in particular, focus on recent\nadvances which include the work of the author mentioned in the EMS prize\ncitation as well as a hint towards her recent joint work with David Schwein."}

Thanks to the\nsubwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying\nantennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information\n(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit\nprecoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to\nboost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work\nproposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A\ntwo-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently\naccomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the\neigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two\nsub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter\nantennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder\nand the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF\npromises to generate near-optimal observation matrices.

The MA-RFM extends the capabilities of\nRFM to handle PDEs with singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free\nefficiency. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through\nample challenging 2D and 3D benchmark problems, even under limited and noisy\nmeasurement conditions, highlighting its robustness and accuracy in\nreconstructing complex and disjoint sources."}

In our\nrecent study, we found that these ER-NE junctions are both narrow and\ninfrequent, measuring less than 20 nanometers in diameter and occurring at a\nfrequency of approximately 0.1 per square micrometer. However, it remains\nunclear whether such limited and narrow connections are sufficient to support\nefficient transport between the ER and NE. Here, we built a mathematical model\nof ER-to-NE protein diffusion, incorporating ultrastructural parameters, the\nfrequency of ER-NE junctions, and the diffusion coefficient of proteins within\nthe ER lumen. To validate the model, we experimentally quantified the transport\nrate of ER luminal proteins to the NE using fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP). Our model and experimental data demonstrate that simple\ndiffusion is sufficient to account for the rapid transport of proteins from the\nER to the NE, despite the limited and narrow nature of the connecting\njunctions.

Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free\napproaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach\nrequires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays,\nDopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is\nnot required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be\nestimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the\nreceived pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring\nfractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free\napproach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited\nregion in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region\noutside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse\nshaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized\nDD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by\nthis, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation\nscheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve\nthis by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the\nmodel-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using\nthis estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate\nof the overall I/O relation.

The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by\nthe Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the\nsolution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and\nthe wavelength is very small (i.e., $\\delta^2 \\ll 1$). We solved the problem up\nto $O(\\delta^2)$ by assuming $\\lambda^2 \\delta^2 \\ll 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the\nratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how\nthe anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and\ntrough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile\ncomponent is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow\nseparation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the\nformation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for\npulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow,\nvortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle.\nSubsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete\nbackflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's\napproximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated\nwith steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing.\nOn the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize\noxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators."}

Being generally NP-hard, GEP\noptimization models can become intractable when nonconvex dynamics,\ntime-coupling constraints, and complex asset interactions are involved. Time\nseries aggregation (TSA) tackles this by reducing temporal complexity via input\ndata clustering. However, existing TSA methods either focus solely on\npreserving the statistical features of the input data, yielding heuristics\nwithout guarantees on the aggregated model's accuracy, or provide error bounds\nlimited to linear models, neglecting time-coupling constraints and applying\nonly to specific clustering techniques. Moreover, these bounds typically\npertain solely to the GEP objective function and do not extend to other\nstakeholder-specific metrics, such as decision vector partitions.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers."}
