However, this method requires solving nonlinear simultaneous equations in $nN$ variables when the problem dimension is $n$. Recently, Ogata pointed out that Gauss-Seidel type fixed-point iteration works surprisingly well for solving these equations, typically reducing the error by one or two orders of magnitude at each iteration. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iteration and give a sufficient condition for its global convergence. We also provide an upper bound on its convergence factor, which explains the efficiency of this iteration. Some numerical examples that illustrate the validity of our analysis are also provided."}

While Flow Matching (FM) offers a powerful paradigm for constructing continuous-time transport maps, its deployment in high-precision integration is severely limited by the discretization bias inherent to numerical ODE solvers and the lack of rigorous convergence guarantees when coupled with Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. This paper addresses these critical gaps by proposing Flow Matching Importance Sampling Quasi-Monte Carlo (FM-ISQMC), a framework designed to transform biased generative flows into unbiased, high-order integration schemes. Methodologically, we construct a transport map by composing a logistic base transformation with an Euler-discretized neural ODE field and employ importance sampling to correct for residual transport errors. Our central contribution is twofold. First, we establish a general convergence analysis for QMC importance sampling with arbitrary transport maps, identifying sufficient growth conditions for the $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error rate. Second, we rigorously prove that the specific transport architecture of Flow Matching satisfies these conditions. Consequently, we establish a $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error for the unbiased FM-ISQMC estimator, extending classical QMC theory to the realm of generative models. Numerical experiments validate that FM-ISQMC consistently breaks through the error floor observed in direct transport methods, delivering superior precision. This work thus bridges the divide between deep generative modeling and numerical integration."}

After performing a conformal change of the metric so that the vector field becomes unit and Killing, we analyze the geometry of the flow it generates through the framework of stable Hamiltonian structures and basic cohomology. Our main result proves that any nowhere-vanishing timelike conformal vector field necessarily arises as the Reeb vector field of either a Sasakian structure or a co-Kähler structure. In other words, every such Lorentzian conformal flow is intrinsically \"Reeb-like\", which forces the underlying geometry to be either contact or cosymplectic.

We introduce estimators that jointly learn the local transfer functions and the target regression, together with fully data-driven procedures that adapt to unknown partition structure and transfer strength. We establish sharp minimax rates for target regression estimation, showing that local transfer can mitigate the curse of dimensionality by exploiting reduced functional complexity.

For any abstract simplicial complex $K$ with the vertex set $K^{(0)}$ a Euclidean subset, its shadow, denoted $S(K)$, is the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. This article centers on the homotopy properties of the shadow of Vietoris-Rips complexes $K=R_β(X)$ with vertices from $\\mathbb{R}^N$, along with the canonical projection map $ p\\colon R_β(X) \\to S(R_β(X))$. The study of the geometric/topological behavior of $p$ is a natural yet non-trivial problem. The map $p$ may have many ``singularities'', which have been partially resolved only in low dimensions $N\\leq 3$. The obstacle naturally leads us to study systems of these complexes $\\{S(R_β(S)) \\mid β> 0, S\\subset X\\}$. We address the challenge posed by singularities in the shadow projection map by studying systems of the shadow complex using inverse system techniques from shape theory, showing that the limit map exhibits favorable homotopy-theoretic properties. More specifically, leveraging ideas and frameworks from Shape Theory, we show that in the limit ``$β\\to 0$ and $S \\to X$'', the limit map ``$\\lim p$'' behaves well with respect to homotopy/homology groups when $X$ is an ANR (Absolute Neighborhood Retract) and admits a metric that satisfies some regularity conditions. This results in limit theorems concerning the homotopy properties of systems of these complexes as the proximity scale parameter approaches zero and the sample set approaches the underlying space (e.g., a submanifold or Euclidean graph). The paper concludes by discussing the potential of these results for finite reconstruction problems in one-dimensional submanifolds."}

Terence Tao noted in [39] that the theory of multivariate polynomials is not yet sufficiently matured to provide similar theorems with an equally simple relation between them. In the present paper we argue that for general multivariate polynomials the right measure for the size of the polynomial should not be the degree, but the leading monomial. In this setting the footprint bound [23] becomes a natural enhancement of the factor theorem providing a bound on the number of common roots of general multivariate polynomials which is sharp for all finite Cartesian product point sets. Furthermore, by using methods from the theory of error-correcting codes we establish a natural formulation of the interpolation theorem to the case of common roots of multivariate polynomials. In short the two theorems reduce to the same result, but for dual spaces, establishing the unification requested in [39]. We leave it for further research to possibly establish similar related results taking multiplicity into account."}

The first approach is based on a weighted arc-length equidistribution strategy driven by a monitor function to adaptively redistribute grid points. An adaptive monitor selection mechanism, constructed from the curvature and its variation, enhances spatial resolution in regions of strong geometric complexity while preserving mesh regularity. The second approach eliminates explicit reparameterization by incorporating a tangential velocity into the Willmore flow, with mesh redistribution inherently embedded in the geometric evolution. We further develop an energy-stable correction algorithm for the second method to guarantee discrete energy stability at the theoretical level. In both approaches, the monitor function serves as the core component of the adaptive framework, encoding essential geometric information -- such as curvature and curvature variation -- to guide mesh refinement and redistribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDFk-based adaptive schemes accurately capture the geometric evolution of the Willmore flow and exhibit excellent robustness and computational efficiency for problems involving complex interface geometries."}

The 3D model minimizes an energy functional that includes elastic strain energy, a damage-dependent degradation function $a_η(α)$, a damage energy term $w(α)$, and a gradient term penalizing abrupt damage variations. After non-dimensionalizing and rescaling, the problem is reformulated on a unit cylinder, and the behaviour of the energy functional is analyzed as $δ$ approaches zero. Using $Γ$-convergence, we show that the sequence of 3D energy functionals converges to a 1D functional, defined over displacement and damage fields that are independent of transverse coordinates. Compactness results guarantee the weak convergence of strains and damage gradients, while lower and upper bound inequalities confirm the energy limit. Minimizers of the 3D energy are proven to converge to the minimizers of the 1D energy, with strains approaching a diagonal form indicative of uniaxial deformation."}

For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective.

In this work, we prove that this same polynomial $g(z)$ dictates the code's stabilizer redundancy and the structure of the classical \\emph{syndrome codes} required for single-shot decoding. We derive a strict equality between the quantum rate and the stabilizer redundancy density, and we provide BCH-like bounds on the achievable single-shot measurement error tolerance.

Unlike the traditional Fourier paradigm, it makes decomposition of a signal possible without any predefined function basis, which gives unprecedented flexibilities while handling narrow-banded signals of varieties. However, determining the number and central frequencies of intrinsic mode functions are still open questions in that few studies has been proposed to give a complete method that can theoretically guarantee the global convergence during decomposition. In this article, we propose a globally convergent numerical optimization method based on variational convex optimization to automatically determine the number and central frequency of IMFs without any prior knowledge for narrow banded signals, as long as the spectra of each sub-band are identifiable. Our method focuses on finding the support baseline of the spectral function, and further separating the significant frequency band regions above the support baseline. Unlike pioneer works that focus on optimizations on complex field, our method achieves obtaining the number of decomposed IMFs and center frequencies in real field by combining variational calculus, convex optimization, and numerical solutions of differential equations in real field and theoretical analysis shows our algorithm is guaranteed terminate to one of the optimum as close as possible. Experiments also shows that our algorithm converges quickly and can be used in practical engineering to determine the prior information of the number of intrinsic modes and evaluate initial center frequency as prior information to continue the VMD procedure."}

By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $ω(t)$ and a scale function $ψ(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the \"Amnesia Phenomenon\": we prove that rapid aging modulates the system's history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods."}

However, due to nonlinear factors in this model, how to estimate $ρ$ efficiently is a long-standing open problem. We tackle the problem by the cycle count approach. The challenge is, due to the nonlinear factors in the model, for any given type of generalized cycles, the expected count is a complicated function of many parameters in the model, so it is unclear how to use cycle counts to estimate $ρ$. However, somewhat surprisingly, we discover that, among many types of generalized cycles with the same length, we can carefully pick a pair of them such that in the ratio between the expected cycle counts of the two types, the non-linear factors cancel out nicely with each other, and as a result, the ratio equals to $\\mathrm{exp}(ρ)$ exactly. Therefore, though the expected count of cycles of any type is not tractable, the ratio between the expected cycle counts of a (carefully chosen) pair of generalized cycles may have an utterly simple form. We study to what extent such pairs exist, and use our discovery to derive both an estimate for $ρ$ and a testing procedure for testing $ρ= ρ_0$. In a setting where we allow a wide range of reciprocal effects and a wide variety of network sparsity and degree heterogeneity, we show that our estimator achieves the optimal rate and our test achieves the optimal phase transition.

Using concentration of measure and the aforementioned volumetric argument, we show that, except possibly on a set of very small measure, oscillator death is observed in finite time; this rigorously demonstrates the existence of the oscillator death regime numerically observed by Ariaratnam and Strogatz (2001). These results are robust under many other choices of interaction functions often considered for the Winfree model. We demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics described in this paper are sharp by analyzing the equilibria of the Winfree model, and we bound the total number of equilibria using a polynomial description.

Current certifications typically rely either on global Lipschitz bounds, which are often conservative, or on local gradient information, which provides only a first-order approximation.

Our proposed concave certificate establishes a tight bound of DR risk that remains applicable to non-Lipschitz and non-differentiable losses. We extend this framework to complexity analysis, introducing a deterministic bound that complements standard statistical generalization bound. Furthermore, we utilize this certificate to bound the gap between adversarial and empirical Rademacher complexity, demonstrating that dependencies on input diameter, network width, and depth can be eliminated. For practical application in deep learning, we introduce the adversarial score as a tractable relaxation of the concave certificate that enables efficient and layer-wise analysis of neural networks.

At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations."}

Glasner on dendrons (rank-1), we establish that every continuous action of a topological group $G$ by median automorphisms on a finite-rank compact median algebra is Rosenthal representable, hence dynamically tame. As an application, the Roller-Fioravanti compactification of any finite-rank topological median $G$-algebra with compact intervals is a dynamically tame $G$-system."}

This paper introduces the notion of \\emph{maximum energy shapeability} which describes the scenario that the homogeneous part of the matching equation admits $m$ independent solutions with $m$ the dimension of the control input. We demonstrate that the maximum energy shapeability enables a systematic procedure for the IDA-PBC design by transforming the matching equation into a set of easier-to-solve PDEs.

We consider two complementary sources of dependence: $(i)$ martingale-type dependence in both the covariate and noise processes, which accommodates non-stationary and non-mixing time series data, and $(ii)$ dependence induced by sequential decision making. Our formulation runs in parallel with classical notions of (local) stationarity and strong mixing, while neither framework fully subsumes the other. Remarkably, SGD is shown to automatically accommodate both independent and dependent information under a broad class of stepsize schedules and exploration rate schemes.\n  Non-asymptotically, we show that SGD simultaneously achieves statistically optimal estimation error and regret, extending and improving existing results. In particular, our tail bounds remain sharp even for potentially infinite horizon $T=+\\infty$.

Without settling the conjecture, Làslò Lovàsz, Michael Saks, and Alexander Schrijver (LSS) showed that a codimension of vertex connectivity both suffices and is best possible under the additional assumption of general position, and gave a probabilistic construction for producing such representations. The present work proves the conjecture of Maehara as well as related conjectures, variants of the Delta Conjecture, that have arisen independently in combinatorial matrix theory. The strongest of these is that minimum degree of G gives a lower bound for the maximum nullity of a positive definite matrix with pattern G that has the Strong Arnold Property (SAP). Such nullity questions are an important subcase of the Inverse Eigenvalue Problem for a Graph (IEPG).\n  The name greedegree is introduced for the largest possible final degree of a maximum cardinality search (MSC) ordering, which is to say an ordering that greedily maximizes adjacencies to previous chosen vertices. The name upper-zero generic is introduced to describe symmetric matrices with nonzero diagonal such that the zeros above the diagonal in any column belong to an independent set of rows, which matrices necessarily have the SAP.\n  The proof technique takes the probabilistic construction of LSS and parametrizes it completely in terms of independent variables, producing large polynomials that are reasoned about using an introduced operad of hanging garden diagrams. In the case of an MSC ordering in codimension greedegree, it is shown that the leading monomial in an appropriate term order has no canceling term, giving a nonzero polynomial. The resulting representation is faithful with upper-zero generic Gram matrix."}

Defining complexity and actually measuring it is an ongoing debate and no standard framework has been established that is both theoretically sound and computationally practical to use. Currently, one of the fields which attempts to formally define complexity is in the realm of Algorithmic Information Theory. The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution. This analysis has been done in order to ascertain if Algorithmic Information Theory can be a viable theory in understanding substructures within graphs and ultimately as a foundation to create frameworks of measuring and analyzing complexity."}

In this article, we develop fully implicit as well as implicit--explicit backward difference formula (BDF) schemes of order up to six. The implicit--explicit variants are decoupled, thereby enhancing computational efficiency; their convergence analysis requires a weak coupling condition on the poroelastic parameters.

We determine novel and suitable multipliers for the two proposed classes and establish error estimates via the energy technique. A prominent advantage of these higher-order schemes is that, with almost the computational cost of first-order schemes, they greatly improve the accuracy."}

While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.\n  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate.

Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance."}

This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\\mathcal{B}$, $g : \\bar P \\to C^0(\\bar P)$, $\\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\\boldsymbolλ : \\bar P \\to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\\boldsymbolλ$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems."}

Comprehensive asymptotic convergence properties are derived under standard assumptions. In particular, under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality and a mild NPC-detectability condition, we prove that our algorithm can avoid strict saddle points and converge to second-order critical points. This is primarily achieved by integrating proper regularization techniques and forward linesearch mechanisms along NPC directions.

Under contour integration this analytic part vanishes (via Cauchy's theorem), leaving only the component containing the desired eigenvalues.

Understanding how information, and its counterpart, uncertainty, propagates is central to predictability studies and has significant implications for applications such as forecast uncertainty quantification and risk management. It also offers valuable insight into the underlying physics of the system. Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics. This new framework offers a promising addition to the diagnostic tools available for studying complex dynamical systems."}

In particular, we are interested in lead-lag relationships between two sequences of order arrival timestamps. The seminal work of Dobrev and Schaumburg proposed model-free measures of cross-market trading activity based on cross-counts of timestamps. While their method is known to yield reliable results, it faces limitations because its original formulation inherently relies on discrete-time observations, an issue we address in this study. Specifically, we formulate the problem of estimating lead-lag relationships in two point processes as that of estimating the shape of the cross-pair correlation function (CPCF) of a bivariate stationary point process, a quantity well-studied in the neuroscience and spatial statistics literature. Within this framework, the prevailing lead-lag time is defined as the location of the CPCF's sharpest peak. Under this interpretation, the peak location in Dobrev and Schaumburg's cross-market activity measure can be viewed as an estimator of the lead-lag time in the aforementioned sense. We further propose an alternative lead-lag time estimator based on kernel density estimation and show that it possesses desirable theoretical properties and delivers superior numerical performance. Empirical evidence from high-frequency financial data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks."}

By identifying spectral equivalence classes with points on a probability simplex, and equipping this space with the Fisher--Rao information metric, a well-defined Riemannian geometry can be obtained that is invariant under unitary transformations and global rescaling. The resulting geometry admits closed-form expressions for distances and geodesics, and has constant positive curvature. Under explicit restrictions, composition enforces boundary faces through rank constraints and, in an aligned model with stated idealisations, induces a non-linear re-weighting of spectral states. Fisher--Rao distances are preserved only in the spectrally uniform case. The construction is abstract and operator-level, introducing no optimisation principles, stochastic models, or modality-specific assumptions.

Firstly, it is shown that sufficiently non-local interactions will regulate ultra-violet divergences that perturbative methods with local interactions produce. However, in asymptotic regimes, infra-red divergences persist and ultra-violet divergences can reappear. Renormalisation methods are shown to report the same universal behaviour as local interactions at critical points. Secondly, the renormalisation group can be interpreted as a space-time-field rescaling that preserves action structure. This can be used to extract solutions to Callan-Symanzik equations directly without having to solve (or construct) the equation. These observations are exemplified for two paradigm models; annihilation $A_p+A_q\\rightarrow φ$, and this process paired with branching, birth and death."}

These systems are expected to handle large-scale deployments and high-density networks with diverse functionalities. As a result, there is an increasing demand for efficient and intelligent algorithms that can operate under uncertainty from both propagation environments and networking systems. Traditional optimization methods often depend on accurate theoretical models of data transmission, but in real-world NG scenarios, they suffer from high computational complexity in large-scale settings. Stochastic Optimization (SO) algorithms, designed to accommodate extremely high density and extensive network scalability, have emerged as a powerful solution for optimizing wireless networks. This includes various categories that range from model-based approaches to learning-based approaches. These techniques are capable of converging within a feasible time frame while addressing complex, large-scale optimization problems. However, there is currently limited research on SO applied for NG networks, especially the upcoming Sixth-Generation (6G). In this survey, we emphasize the relationship between NG systems and SO by eight open questions involving the background, key features, and lesson learned. Overall, our study starts by providing a detailed overview of both areas, covering fundamental and widely used SO techniques, spanning from single to multi-objective signal processing. Next, we explore how different algorithms can solve NG challenges, such as load balancing, optimizing energy efficiency, improving spectral efficiency, or handling multiple performance trade-offs.

In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks."}

This article centers on the homotopy properties of the shadow of Vietoris-Rips complexes $K=R_β(X)$ with vertices from $\\mathbb{R}^N$, along with the canonical projection map $ p\\colon R_β(X) \\to S(R_β(X))$. The study of the geometric/topological behavior of $p$ is a natural yet non-trivial problem.

The obstacle naturally leads us to study systems of these complexes $\\{S(R_β(S)) \\mid β> 0, S\\subset X\\}$. We address the challenge posed by singularities in the shadow projection map by studying systems of the shadow complex using inverse system techniques from shape theory, showing that the limit map exhibits favorable homotopy-theoretic properties.

This results in limit theorems concerning the homotopy properties of systems of these complexes as the proximity scale parameter approaches zero and the sample set approaches the underlying space (e.g., a submanifold or Euclidean graph). The paper concludes by discussing the potential of these results for finite reconstruction problems in one-dimensional submanifolds."}

In contrast to the exponential dependence due to standard arguments, the obtained error bound depends on $ε^{-1}$ and $T$ polynomially.

Also, a uniform-in-time error bound of order $O(τ^γ),γ<\\tfrac12$, is obtained for a fixed $ε=1$, which improves the existing ones in the literature and matches the classical weak convergence rate in the globally Lipschitz setting. The error analysis is highly nontrivial due to the low regularity of the considered problem, the super-linear growth of the drift, the non-smooth observables inherent in the total variation metric and the presence of the small interface parameter $ε\\to0$. These difficulties are addressed by introducing a new strategy of nonlinearity modification and establishing refined regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation to an auxiliary process with non-smooth test functions.

Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structural features of beamformers. In contrast, by leveraging conditional generative models, GenSSBF addresses these issues via learning a conditional distribution over feasible beamformers. By doing so, the synthesis of diverse and high-fidelity beam candidates from coarse channel sensing measurements can be guaranteed. This article presents the fundamentals, system designs, and implementation methods of GenSSBF. Case studies in both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that GenSSBF attains near-optimal beamforming gain with ultra-low channel acquisition overhead.

Inference on the associated rates of change has seen some recent developments. The literature has been restricted to Euclidean domains, where inference is sought on directional derivatives, rates along a chosen direction of interest, at arbitrary locations. Inference for higher order rates, particularly directional curvature has also proved useful in these settings. Modern spatial data often arise from non-Euclidean domains. This manuscript particularly considers spatial processes defined over compact Riemannian manifolds. We develop a comprehensive inferential framework for spatial rates of change for such processes over vector fields. In doing so, we formalize smoothness of process realizations and construct differential processes -- the derivative and curvature processes. We derive conditions for kernels that ensure the existence of these processes and establish validity of the joint multivariate process consisting of the ``parent'' Gaussian process (GP) over the manifold and the associated differential processes. Predictive inference on these rates is devised conditioned on the realized process over the manifold. Manifolds arise as polyhedral meshes in practice. The success of our simulation experiments for assessing derivatives for processes observed over such meshes validate our theoretical findings. By enhancing our understanding of GPs on manifolds, this manuscript unlocks a variety of potential applications in machine learning and statistics where GPs have seen wide usage. We propose a fully model-based approach to inference on the differential processes arising from a spatial process from partially observed or realized data across scattered location on a manifold."}

The method employs an unstructured triangular mesh with support for triangulation of elements to form finer subgrids locally. The bathymetry is represented on the fine mesh, allowing the incorporation of small-scale features, while velocities are defined on the coarse mesh. The governing equations are solved numerically on the coarse mesh, making the method computationally cheaper compared to a traditional fine mesh computation. To accurately represent the velocities, we employ a second-order accurate WENO method and for temporal integration an explicit second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, we present a novel subgrid face value reconstruction that accounts for partially wet cells, where only some of the subgrid cells are wet. Together with a newly developed gravity source term discretization, we demonstrate that the scheme is well-balanced on the subgrid level. Finally, the subgrid method is validated on several test cases to show: i) that the scheme is well-balanced, ii) confirm the order of the accuracy of the scheme, and iii) demonstrate the capability of handling moving flood and dry boundaries. We also highlight when it is beneficial to increase the number of subgrid cells to improve the results of the finite volume method."}

This article is dedicated to the memory of Haïm Brezis whose life and work were a great source of inspiration", "summary": "We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."}

The EBD framework is further optimized for extended Hamming codes as an example, through offline and online exclusion mechanisms, leading to a substantial complexity reduction without loss of ML performance. Complexity analysis shows that, for extended Hamming codes of lengths 64, 128, and 256, the fully optimized EBD requires approximately an order of magnitude fewer floating-point operations on average than minimum-edge trellis Viterbi decoding at a frame error rate of $10^{-3}$."}

Traditional approaches first estimate demand functions and then integrate to compute consumer surplus, but these methods can be challenging to implement in practice due to model misspecification in parametric demand forms and the large data requirements and slow convergence of flexible nonparametric or machine learning approaches. Instead, we exploit the randomness inherent in modern algorithmic pricing, arising from the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and introduce an estimator that avoids explicit estimation and numerical integration of the demand function. Each observed purchase outcome at a randomized price is an unbiased estimate of demand and by carefully reweighting purchase outcomes using novel cumulative propensity weights (CPW), we are able to reconstruct the integral. Building on this idea, we introduce a doubly robust variant named the augmented cumulative propensity weighting (ACPW) estimator that only requires one of either the demand model or the historical pricing policy distribution to be correctly specified. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the use of flexible machine learning methods for estimating consumer surplus, since it achieves fast convergence rates by incorporating an estimate of demand, even when the machine learning estimate has slower convergence rates. Neither of these estimators is a standard application of off-policy evaluation techniques as the target estimand, consumer surplus, is unobserved. To address fairness, we extend this framework to an inequality-aware surplus measure, allowing regulators and firms to quantify the profit-equity trade-off. Finally, we validate our methods through comprehensive numerical studies."}

Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. \nOur main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile. If the decay rate is slower than the critical decay rate, the electric field dominates and completely destroys the corner structure, resulting in a cusp singularity. The analysis of these singularities relies on variational principles and geometric methods. Key technical tools include a Weiss-type monotonicity formula, a frequency formula, and a concentration-compactness argument."}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs."}

An empirical application to a high-dimensional panel of daily financial return series spanning major asset classes illustrates system-level causal monitoring in practice. Directional organization is episodic and stress-dependent, causal propagation strengthens while remaining multi-channel, dominant causal hubs reallocate rapidly, and statistically robust transmission channels are sparse and horizon-heterogeneous even when aggregate lead--lag asymmetry is weak. The framework provides a scalable and interpretable complement to correlation-, factor-, and pairwise Granger-style analyses for complex systems."}

Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems."}

Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to y}(-θ),\\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to x}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to x}(-θ)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to y}(-θ)$.

General-purpose imputation methods, while widely used, often distort key statistical properties of the data, such as variance and dependence structure, leading to biased estimation and misleading inference. These issues become more pronounced in models that explicitly rely on capturing serial dependence, as standard imputation techniques fail to preserve the underlying dynamics. This paper proposes a novel multiple imputation method specifically designed for parameter estimation in observation-driven models (ODM). The approach takes advantage of the iterative nature of the systematic component in ODM to propagate the dependence structure through missing data, minimizing its impact on estimation. Unlike traditional imputation techniques, the proposed method accommodates continuous, discrete, and mixed-type data while preserving key distributional and dependence properties. We evaluate its performance through Monte Carlo simulations in the context of GARMA models, considering time series with up to 70\\% missing data. An application to the proportion of stocked energy stored in South Brazil further demonstrates its practical utility."}

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems."}

This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with different metaphor novelty datasets. We analyse surprisal from 16 LM variants on corpus-based and synthetic metaphor novelty datasets. We explore a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LMs yield significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (Quality-Power Hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains a limited metric of linguistic creativity."}

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems."}

Subsequently, for a fixed period, we construct a family of periodic solutions that depend smoothly on the wave speed; this is achieved via the implicit function theorem. The spectral stability of these waves is then rigorously addressed. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operator around the wave of fixed period. A key element in this analysis is the monotonicity of the period map, which, when combined with Morse index theory, enables us to fully characterize the non-positive spectrum of the projected operator in the space of zero-mean periodic functions. Finally, by employing the Hamiltonian-Krein index analysis, we determine the spectral stability and instability of the constructed waves. We additionally discuss qualitative aspects of the Cauchy problem associated with the sinh-Gordon equation, including local well-posedness and blow-up phenomena. The former supports a new linearization of the problem, while the latter predicts the spectral instability of the wave."}

Inference on the associated rates of change has seen some recent developments. The literature has been restricted to Euclidean domains, where inference is sought on directional derivatives, rates along a chosen direction of interest, at arbitrary locations. Inference for higher order rates, particularly directional curvature has also proved useful in these settings. Modern spatial data often arise from non-Euclidean domains. This manuscript particularly considers spatial processes defined over compact Riemannian manifolds. We develop a comprehensive inferential framework for spatial rates of change for such processes over vector fields. In doing so, we formalize smoothness of process realizations and construct differential processes -- the derivative and curvature processes. We derive conditions for kernels that ensure the existence of these processes and establish validity of the joint multivariate process consisting of the ``parent'' Gaussian process (GP) over the manifold and the associated differential processes. Predictive inference on these rates is devised conditioned on the realized process over the manifold. Manifolds arise as polyhedral meshes in practice. The success of our simulation experiments for assessing derivatives for processes observed over such meshes validate our theoretical findings. By enhancing our understanding of GPs on manifolds, this manuscript unlocks a variety of potential applications in machine learning and statistics where GPs have seen wide usage. We propose a fully model-based approach to inference on the differential processes arising from a spatial process from partially observed or realized data across scattered location on a manifold."}

We classify all possible harmonic systems in 10-TET using a single structural parameter $Δ$, representing the difference between the harmonic mediants (the major and minor ``thirds'') which sum to the generator (the ``fifth'').\n  Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of possibilities. The system defined by $Δ=1$, which is naturally the first to consider, initially appears to suffer from a fundamental structural flaw: its harmonic space fractures into two disjoint universes. Conversely, the ``Wide'' system ($Δ=5$) emerges as a geometrically superior structure, isomorphic to the \\textbf{Desargues Configuration} $(10_3)_1$ and forming a fully connected, vertex-transitive graph. Between these extremes lies the ``Tritone'' system ($Δ=3$), which forms a connected Decagonal Prism. Our main result is the discovery of a topological isomorphism between the ``restored'' Acoustic system ($Δ=1$) and the Tritone system ($Δ=3$): despite disjoint intervallic definitions, both generate the Generalized Petersen graph $GP(10,1)$. These results suggest that in 10-TET, the path to harmonic symmetry lies in the geometry of the projective plane and prism graphs rather than pure acoustics."}

In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \\(\\ddot{a}=F(a,\\dot{a})\\), so that both of them lead to the same result.

While transportation resilience has been widely studied, understanding how random and targeted disruptions affect both structural connectivity and functional performance remains a key challenge. To address this, our study evaluates the robustness of the U.S. intermodal freight network, comprising rail and water modes, using a simulation-based framework that integrates graph-theoretic metrics with flow-weighted centrality measures. We examine disruption scenarios including random failures as well as targeted node and edge removals based on static and dynamically updated degree and betweenness centrality. To reflect more realistic conditions, we also consider flow-weighted degree centralities and partial node degradation. Two resilience indicators are used: the size of the giant connected component (GCC) to measure structural connectivity, and flow-weighted network efficiency (NE) to assess freight mobility under disruption. Results show that progressively degrading nodes ranked by Weighted Degree Centrality to 60% of their original functionality causes a sharper decline in normalized NE, for up to approximately 45 affected nodes, than complete failure (100% loss of functionality) applied to nodes targeted by weighted betweenness centrality or selected at random. This highlights how partial degradation of high-tonnage hubs can produce disproportionately large functional losses. The findings emphasize the need for resilience strategies that go beyond network topology to incorporate freight flow dynamics."}

Neural operator learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to approximate dynamical generators from data, yet stiffness imposes severe obstacles: training errors concentrate on slow manifold states, collapse of fast dynamics occurs, and the learned operator may fail to reproduce the true eigenstructure.\n  We demonstrate three key advances enabling accurate learning of stiff operators and preserving spectral fidelity: (i) stiffness aware scaling of time derivatives, (ii) fast direction excitation via local trajectory cloud bursts, and (iii) autograd-based Jacobian diagnostics ensuring eigenstructure fidelity. Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity. These results argue that spectral fidelity - not trajectory accuracy alone - should be a first-class target in data driven learning of stiff operators."}

Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \\le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\\mathscr{B}^{s,\\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved.

We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM.

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."}

Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."}

A central requirement of $μ$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $μ$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $μ$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $μ$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $μ$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training. We also take the first step towards an adaptive spectral condition by incorporating data-dependent effects, making it better suited for long-horizon LLM training."}

Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means.

We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances.

We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction."}

Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries equations show that LSEM maintains predictive accuracy while scaling to spatial domains larger than those seen in training. LSEM offers an interpretable and extensible route toward foundation-model surrogate solvers built from reusable local models."}

For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond naïve mean-field-type gradient expansions.

In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks."}

Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."}
