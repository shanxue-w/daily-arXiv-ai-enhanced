### [1] [Solving engineering eigenvalue problems with neural networks using the Rayleigh quotient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04375)
*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based method for solving eigenvalue problems using the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, demonstrating its effectiveness for irregular domains and high-dimensional cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are common in engineering but underexplored in physics-informed machine learning. Neural network discretizations complicate eigenvalue analysis, requiring specialized techniques.

Method: Proposes using a neural network to discretize eigenfunctions, combined with the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for eigenvalue analysis.

Result: The method is effective for irregular domains, parametric/nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional cases, and harmonic functions are useful for PDE solutions.

Conclusion: The approach offers unique advantages for continuous eigenvalue problems, as demonstrated in engineering mechanics examples.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

### [2] [Exponential Time Differencing Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (ETD-RKDG) Methods for Nonlinear Degenerate Parabolic Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04416)
*Ziyao Xu,Yong-Tao Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces high-order ETD-RK DG methods for solving nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations, addressing stiffness and wave-front capture with stabilizing limiters and unstructured meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of sharp wave fronts and stiff parabolic terms in degenerate parabolic equations, which require small time steps for explicit methods.

Method: Uses DG methods with stabilizing limiters on unstructured meshes for spatial discretization and ETD-RK methods for time integration, leveraging the Jacobian matrix for stiffness extraction.

Result: Demonstrates improved stability and larger time-step sizes, validated through linear stability analysis and 3D computational results.

Conclusion: The proposed ETD-RK DG methods effectively handle the stiffness and wave-front challenges in degenerate parabolic equations, enabling efficient solutions on complex domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we study high-order exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta
(ETD-RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear degenerate parabolic
equations. This class of equations exhibits hyperbolic behavior in degenerate
regions and parabolic behavior in non-degenerate regions, resulting in sharp
wave fronts in the solution profiles and a parabolic-type time-step
restriction, $\tau \sim O(h^2)$, for explicit time integration. To address
these challenges and solve such equations in complex domains, we employ DG
methods with appropriate stabilizing limiters on unstructured meshes to capture
the wave fronts and use ETD-RK methods for time integration to resolve the
stiffness of parabolic terms. We extract the system's stiffness using the
Jacobian matrix of the DG discretization for diffusion terms and adopt a nodal
formulation to facilitate its computation. The algorithm is described in detail
for two-dimensional triangular meshes. We also conduct a linear stability
analysis in one spatial dimension and present computational results on
three-dimensional simplex meshes, demonstrating significant improvements in
stability and large time-step sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve nonlinear systems arising from time integration of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Method: Runge-Kutta time integration, finite element discretization, Newton's method with augmented Lagrangian preconditioner in flexible GMRES.

Result: Numerical evidence shows robustness and efficiency across varying parameters (viscosity, mesh size, time step, Runge-Kutta stages).

Conclusion: The proposed strategy is effective for solving the nonlinear systems in this context.

Abstract: We consider a Runge--Kutta method for the numerical time integration of the
nonstationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. This yields a sequence
of nonlinear problems to be solved for the stages of the Runge--Kutta method.
The resulting nonlinear system of differential equations is discretized using a
finite element method. To compute a numerical approximation of the stages at
each time step, we employ Newton's method, which requires the solution of a
large and sparse generalized saddle-point problem at each nonlinear iteration.
We devise an augmented Lagrangian preconditioner within the flexible GMRES
method for solving the Newton systems at each time step. The preconditioner can
be applied inexactly with the help of a multigrid routine. We present numerical
evidence of the robustness and efficiency of the proposed strategy for
different values of the viscosity, mesh size, time step, and number of stages
of the Runge--Kutta method.

### [4] [An Array Decomposition Method for Finite Arrays with Electrically Connected Elements for fast Toeplitz Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04710)
*Lucas Åkerstedt,Harald Hultin,B. L. G. Jonsson*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A memory-efficient method for constructing impedance matrices in array antennas using multilevel block Toeplitz structure, reducing memory usage from O(N_x^2 N_y^2) to O(N_x N_y).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in memory usage for impedance matrix calculations in array antennas with finite translational symmetries.

Method: Uses MoM with RWG-like elements on structured meshes, introduces nine connectable components for assembly, and leverages multilevel block Toeplitz structure for reuse.

Result: Demonstrated on a 32x32 array (far-field) and two 9x9 arrays (scattering parameters), showing significant memory reduction.

Conclusion: The method efficiently handles non-symmetric parts and improves computational performance for MoM current vector calculations.

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.

*Nicola Cavallini,Gianmarco Manzini,Daniele Funaro,Andrea Favalli*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the T²S² solver to tackle high-dimensional transport equations, combining Spectral Collocation, Superconsistency, and Tensor Train format for efficient, accurate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transport phenomena are crucial but computationally challenging due to high dimensionality. Existing methods struggle with efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The T²S² solver integrates Spectral Collocation for exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stability, and Tensor Train format for data compression.

Result: Achieves extremely low compression ratios (~10⁻¹²) and solves high-dimensional problems in minutes on standard hardware.

Conclusion: T²S² makes previously intractable transport problems feasible, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex phenomena.

Abstract: Transport phenomena-describing the movement of particles, energy, or other
physical quantities-are fundamental in various scientific disciplines,
including nuclear physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, engineering, and the
natural sciences.
  However, solving the associated seven-dimensional transport equations poses a
significant computational challenge due to the curse of dimensionality.
  We introduce the Tensor Train Superconsistent Spectral (T${^2}$S${^2}$)
solver to address this challenge, integrating Spectral Collocation for
exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stabilization in
transport-dominated regimes, and Tensor Train format for substantial data
compression. T${^2}$S${^2}$ enforces a dimension-wise superconsistent condition
compatible with tensor structures, achieving extremely low compression ratios,
in the order of $(10^{-12})$, while preserving spectral accuracy. Numerical
experiments on linear problems demonstrate that T${^2}$S${^2}$ can solve
high-dimensional transport problems in minutes on standard hardware, making
previously intractable problems computationally feasible. This advancement
opens new avenues for efficiently and accurately modeling complex transport
phenomena.

*Athanasios C. Antoulas,Ion Victor Gosea,Charles Poussot-Vassal,Pierre Vuillemin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper evaluates various tensor-based methods for multivariate function approximation, comparing their performance and features without ranking them, and provides a benchmark collection for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fairly assess and guide users on the performance, possibilities, and limitations of different tensor approximation methods.

Method: Construct tensors from multivariate functions of varying complexity, test method performances (accuracy, computational time, etc.), and compare methods using multiple criteria.

Result: A benchmark collection of tools for tensor approximation is provided, with detailed insights into the multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF).

Conclusion: The paper aims to help users understand and choose appropriate tensor approximation methods, emphasizing fairness and practical guidance.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in
order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details
with simple examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently compute transient acoustic fields generated by internal sources outside a spherical surface.

Method: Uses Lebedev quadratures for spatial integration and Lagrange interpolation in an advanced time algorithm.

Result: Achieves near machine-precision accuracy; speed-up depends on quadrature order, breaking even at 1.15 times the number of surface nodes.

Conclusion: The method is accurate and efficient for evaluating transient acoustic fields.

Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field
generated outside a spherical surface by sources inside the surface. The method
employs Lebedev quadratures, which are the optimal method for spatial
integration, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time
algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing
demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a
speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule
employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points
about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes.

### [8] [Efficient randomized algorithms for the fixed Tucker-rank problem of Tucker decomposition with adaptive shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04840)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge theoretical advancements with scalable solutions for tensor decomposition, addressing the inefficiency of deterministic approaches.

Method: Integration of adaptive shifted power iterations into randomized variants of T-HOSVD and ST-HOSVD to accelerate convergence and reduce power iterations.

Result: Theoretical error bounds show comparable or superior accuracy to deterministic methods, with numerical experiments confirming efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms significantly reduce runtime and approximation error, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Randomized numerical linear algebra is proved to bridge theoretical
advancements to offer scalable solutions for approximating tensor
decomposition. This paper introduces fast randomized algorithms for solving the
fixed Tucker-rank problem of Tucker decomposition, through the integration of
adaptive shifted power iterations. The proposed algorithms enhance randomized
variants of truncated high-order singular value decomposition (T-HOSVD) and
sequentially T-HOSVD (ST-HOSVD) by incorporating dynamic shift strategies,
which accelerate convergence by refining the singular value gap and reduce the
number of required power iterations while maintaining accuracy. Theoretical
analyses provide probabilistic error bounds, demonstrating that the proposed
methods achieve comparable or superior accuracy compared to deterministic
approaches. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate
the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms, showing a significant
decline in runtime and approximation error over state-of-the-art techniques.

### [9] [Active flux for ideal magnetohydrodynamics: A positivity-preserving scheme with the Godunov-Powell source term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04857)
*Junming Duan,Praveen Chandrashekar,Christian Klingenberg*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a positivity-preserving Active Flux (AF) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics, incorporating the Godunov-Powell source term and novel limiters to ensure density and pressure positivity, while maintaining high-order accuracy and shock-capturing ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining positivity in high-order finite volume schemes for magnetohydrodynamics while handling divergence-free constraints and shock-capturing.

Method: Uses a compact AF scheme with point value degrees of freedom, LLF flux vector splitting, and a parametrized flux limiter. Introduces a shock sensor for oscillation suppression and validates the Godunov-Powell source term's role.

Result: Demonstrates third-order accuracy, positivity preservation, and effective shock-capturing in numerical tests. Validates the importance of the Godunov-Powell source term.

Conclusion: The proposed PP AF scheme successfully balances high-order accuracy, positivity preservation, and divergence control, making it suitable for complex magnetohydrodynamics simulations.

Abstract: The Active Flux (AF) is a compact, high-order finite volume scheme that
allows more flexibility by introducing additional point value degrees of
freedom at cell interfaces. This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF
scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell
source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the
evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite
volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built
on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact
stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs
(LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally
proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to
discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a
scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity
by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source
term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence
error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the
cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order
accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role
of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in
controlling divergence error is also validated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model nematic liquid crystals accurately, ensuring physical constraints via the Ball-Majumdar potential and addressing anisotropy in elastic energy.

Method: Finite element approximation for nonlinear elliptic PDEs with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem for discrete solutions.

Result: Proves well-posedness, existence, and local uniqueness of discrete solutions, with optimal convergence rates in the energy norm.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models nematic liquid crystals, ensuring physical realism and demonstrating robust numerical performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive finite element approximation framework
for three-dimensional Landau-de Gennes $Q$-tensor energies for nematic liquid
crystals, with a particular focus on the anisotropy of the elastic energy and
the Ball-Majumdar singular potential. This potential imposes essential physical
constraints on the eigenvalues of the $Q$-tensor, ensuring realistic modeling.
We address the approximation of regular solutions to nonlinear elliptic partial
differential equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions associated with
Landau-de Gennes energies. The well-posedness of the discrete linearized
problem is rigorously demonstrated. The existence and local uniqueness of the
discrete solution is derived using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem. Furthermore,
we demonstrate an optimal order convergence rate in the energy norm and discuss
the impact of eigenvalue constraints on the a priori error analysis.

*Yema Paul,Emmanuel Delande,Francois Vinet,Francois Laporte,Manuel Sanjurjo-Rivo,Aldo Tonnini,Joan-Pau Sanchez*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A method for estimating collision probability for tethered spacecraft, improving accuracy by accounting for tether shape and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard collision probability methods are overly conservative for tethered spacecraft due to spherical hard-body assumptions.

Method: Maximizes collision probability over all physically admissible tether shapes, considering spatial extent and configuration uncertainty.

Result: Provides more realistic risk estimates for real-world conjunction events involving kilometer-scale tethers.

Conclusion: Enhances ability to distinguish hazardous encounters, aiding informed collision avoidance decisions.

Abstract: This Engineering Note addresses the challenge of estimating the probability
of collision for tethered spacecraft during close encounters with other space
objects. Standard probability of collision methods, based on spherical
hard-body assumptions, tend to be overly conservative when applied to long
tether systems. We introduce a method that accounts for the tether's spatial
extent and configuration uncertainty by maximizing the probability of collision
over all physically admissible tether shapes. Applied to real-world conjunction
events involving a kilometer-scale flexible inextensible tether, the method
yields more realistic risk estimates. This approach improves the ability to
distinguish hazardous from benign encounters, thereby supporting more informed
collision avoidance decisions.

Method: Uses norming set theory to control sketching dimensions for various operators, introducing the median sketch for embedding with sparse or tensor-structured measurements.

Result: The median sketch embeds sets using only ~O(dim V) measurements, improving efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework and median sketch advance sketching theory for algebraic varieties and polynomial maps, offering practical benefits for dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: This paper develops the sketching (i.e., randomized dimension reduction)
theory for real algebraic varieties and images of polynomial maps, including,
e.g., the set of low rank tensors and tensor networks. Through the lens of
norming sets, we provide a framework for controlling the sketching dimension
for \textit{any} sketch operator used to embed said sets, including
sub-Gaussian, fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and tensor structured sketch
operators. Leveraging norming set theory, we propose a new sketching method
called the median sketch. It embeds such a set $V$ using only
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\dim V)$ tensor structured or sparse linear
measurements.

Method: Uses the method of moments (MoM) with RWG-like elements on a structured mesh, introducing nine distinct electrically connectable components to represent and reuse impedance calculations.

Result: Demonstrated by computing far-field of a 32x32 array and scattering parameters of two 9x9 arrays, showing significant memory reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for memory-efficient and faster MoM current vector calculations in array antennas.

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the T²S² solver to tackle the computational challenge of high-dimensional transport equations, combining Spectral Collocation, Superconsistency, and Tensor Train format for efficient and accurate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transport phenomena are fundamental in many fields, but solving their high-dimensional equations is computationally difficult due to the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The T²S² solver integrates Spectral Collocation for exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stability, and Tensor Train format for data compression.

Result: T²S² achieves extremely low compression ratios (~10⁻¹²) and solves high-dimensional problems in minutes on standard hardware.

Conclusion: This method makes previously intractable transport problems feasible, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex phenomena.

Abstract: Transport phenomena-describing the movement of particles, energy, or other
physical quantities-are fundamental in various scientific disciplines,
including nuclear physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, engineering, and the
natural sciences.
  However, solving the associated seven-dimensional transport equations poses a
significant computational challenge due to the curse of dimensionality.
  We introduce the Tensor Train Superconsistent Spectral (T${^2}$S${^2}$)
solver to address this challenge, integrating Spectral Collocation for
exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stabilization in
transport-dominated regimes, and Tensor Train format for substantial data
compression. T${^2}$S${^2}$ enforces a dimension-wise superconsistent condition
compatible with tensor structures, achieving extremely low compression ratios,
in the order of $(10^{-12})$, while preserving spectral accuracy. Numerical
experiments on linear problems demonstrate that T${^2}$S${^2}$ can solve
high-dimensional transport problems in minutes on standard hardware, making
previously intractable problems computationally feasible. This advancement
opens new avenues for efficiently and accurately modeling complex transport
phenomena.

Motivation: To fairly assess and compare various tensor approximation methods, providing insights into their strengths and limitations for user guidance.

Method: Construct tensors from multivariate functions of varying complexity, evaluate method performance (accuracy, computational time, etc.), and compare using multiple criteria.

Result: A benchmark collection is provided, with detailed analysis of methods, including the multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF).

Conclusion: The paper aims to guide users in understanding and selecting tensor approximation tools, emphasizing fairness and practical insights.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in
order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details
with simple examples.

Motivation: To efficiently compute the transient acoustic field generated by internal sources outside a spherical surface.

Method: Uses Lebedev quadratures for spatial integration and Lagrange interpolation/differentiation in an advanced time algorithm.

Result: Near machine-precision accuracy; speed-up depends on quadrature order, breaking even at ~1.15x field points vs. surface nodes.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and accurate for transient acoustic field evaluation.

Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field

demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a
speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule
employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points
about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes.

Motivation: To bridge theoretical advancements with scalable solutions for tensor decomposition, addressing the fixed Tucker-rank problem.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms offer efficient, robust solutions for Tucker decomposition, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Randomized numerical linear algebra is proved to bridge theoretical

adaptive shifted power iterations. The proposed algorithms enhance randomized
variants of truncated high-order singular value decomposition (T-HOSVD) and
sequentially T-HOSVD (ST-HOSVD) by incorporating dynamic shift strategies,
which accelerate convergence by refining the singular value gap and reduce the
number of required power iterations while maintaining accuracy. Theoretical
analyses provide probabilistic error bounds, demonstrating that the proposed

### [21] [Active flux for ideal magnetohydrodynamics: A positivity-preserving scheme with the Godunov-Powell source term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04857)
*Junming Duan,Praveen Chandrashekar,Christian Klingenberg*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A positivity-preserving Active Flux (AF) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics is proposed, using Godunov-Powell source term for divergence-free constraint. The method combines conservative and nonconservative terms, employs flux limiters for positivity, and introduces a shock sensor for oscillation control. Numerical tests confirm third-order accuracy, positivity preservation, and shock-capturing ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-order, compact, and flexible finite volume scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics that preserves positivity (density and pressure) and handles divergence-free constraints effectively.

Method: The scheme uses the AF framework with point value degrees of freedom. It employs the Godunov-Powell source term, quadratic reconstruction for nonconservative terms, LLF flux vector splitting, and central differencing. Positivity is ensured via parametrized and scaling limiters, while a new shock sensor controls oscillations.

Result: Numerical tests demonstrate third-order accuracy, positivity preservation, and effective shock-capturing. The Godunov-Powell source term's role in controlling divergence error is validated.

Conclusion: The proposed PP AF scheme is effective for ideal magnetohydrodynamics, balancing high-order accuracy, positivity preservation, and divergence control.

Abstract: The Active Flux (AF) is a compact, high-order finite volume scheme that
allows more flexibility by introducing additional point value degrees of
freedom at cell interfaces. This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF
scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell
source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the
evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite
volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built
on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact
stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs
(LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally
proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to
discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a
scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity
by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source
term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence
error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the
cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order
accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role
of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in
controlling divergence error is also validated.

Motivation: To model nematic liquid crystals realistically by addressing the anisotropy of elastic energy and enforcing physical constraints on Q-tensor eigenvalues.

Method: Finite element approximation for nonlinear elliptic PDEs with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem for discrete solution existence and uniqueness.

Result: Proves well-posedness of the discrete problem, optimal convergence rates in energy norm, and analyzes eigenvalue constraints' impact on error.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models nematic liquid crystals with rigorous mathematical guarantees and practical constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive finite element approximation framework
for three-dimensional Landau-de Gennes $Q$-tensor energies for nematic liquid
crystals, with a particular focus on the anisotropy of the elastic energy and
the Ball-Majumdar singular potential. This potential imposes essential physical
constraints on the eigenvalues of the $Q$-tensor, ensuring realistic modeling.
We address the approximation of regular solutions to nonlinear elliptic partial
differential equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions associated with
Landau-de Gennes energies. The well-posedness of the discrete linearized
problem is rigorously demonstrated. The existence and local uniqueness of the
discrete solution is derived using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem. Furthermore,
we demonstrate an optimal order convergence rate in the energy norm and discuss
the impact of eigenvalue constraints on the a priori error analysis.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A method to estimate collision probability for tethered spacecraft, improving accuracy by accounting for tether shape and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard collision probability methods are overly conservative for tethered spacecraft due to spherical hard-body assumptions.

Method: Maximizes collision probability over all physically admissible tether shapes, considering spatial extent and configuration uncertainty.

Result: Applied to real-world events, the method provides more realistic risk estimates for kilometer-scale tethers.

Conclusion: Enhances ability to distinguish hazardous encounters, aiding better collision avoidance decisions.

Abstract: This Engineering Note addresses the challenge of estimating the probability
of collision for tethered spacecraft during close encounters with other space
objects. Standard probability of collision methods, based on spherical
hard-body assumptions, tend to be overly conservative when applied to long
tether systems. We introduce a method that accounts for the tether's spatial
extent and configuration uncertainty by maximizing the probability of collision
over all physically admissible tether shapes. Applied to real-world conjunction
events involving a kilometer-scale flexible inextensible tether, the method
yields more realistic risk estimates. This approach improves the ability to
distinguish hazardous from benign encounters, thereby supporting more informed
collision avoidance decisions.

Conclusion: The median sketch offers a practical and efficient solution for sketching complex algebraic sets.

Abstract: This paper develops the sketching (i.e., randomized dimension reduction)
theory for real algebraic varieties and images of polynomial maps, including,
e.g., the set of low rank tensors and tensor networks. Through the lens of
norming sets, we provide a framework for controlling the sketching dimension
for \textit{any} sketch operator used to embed said sets, including
sub-Gaussian, fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and tensor structured sketch
operators. Leveraging norming set theory, we propose a new sketching method
called the median sketch. It embeds such a set $V$ using only
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\dim V)$ tensor structured or sparse linear
measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem models real-world applications with hard constraints, requiring conflict-free assignments while minimizing costs.

Method: A mixed integer linear program is solved using the open-source solver CP-SAT from Google OR-Tools.

Result: The approach matches state-of-the-art solvers and provides faster, better heuristic solutions than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and simpler, demonstrating the potential of CP-SAT for such problems.

Abstract: A variant of the well-known Assignment Problem is studied in this paper,
where pairs of assignments are conflicting, and cannot be selected at the same
time. This configures a set of hard constraints. The problem, which models real
applications, looks for a complete assignment that minimizes the total cost,
while no conflict is violated. In this paper, we consider a previously known
mixed integer linear program representing the problem and we solve it with the
open-source solver CP-SAT, part of the Google OR-Tools computational suite. An
experimental campaign on the instances available from the literature, indicates
that the approach we propose achieves results comparable with, those of
state-of-the-art solvers, notwithstanding its intrinsic conceptual and
implementation simplicity. The solver adopted is also able to provide heuristic
solutions quicker and better than the heuristic methods previously discussed in
the literature.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the value of stochastic predictions in online optimal control, introducing 'prediction power' to measure cost improvement and deriving its closed-form expression for LQR settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work ignores stochastic dependence between predictions and disturbances, limiting performance guarantees. This paper aims to model their joint distribution and quantify the benefit of predictions.

Method: A general framework models the joint distribution of predictions and disturbances. Closed-form expressions for prediction power are derived for LQR settings, and a lower bound is established for general dynamics.

Result: Prediction power is quantified, showing significant performance gains even with weakly dependent predictions. The LQR case provides a clear connection between prediction power and policy optimization.

Conclusion: Stochastic predictions offer substantial benefits in control systems, with prediction power providing a more meaningful metric than prediction accuracy alone.

Abstract: We study the value of stochastic predictions in online optimal control with
random disturbances. Prior work provides performance guarantees based on
prediction error but ignores the stochastic dependence between predictions and
disturbances. We introduce a general framework modeling their joint
distribution and define "prediction power" as the control cost improvement from
the optimal use of predictions compared to ignoring the predictions. In the
time-varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting, we derive a closed-form
expression for prediction power and discuss its mismatch with prediction
accuracy and connection with online policy optimization. To extend beyond LQR,
we study general dynamics and costs. We establish a lower bound of prediction
power under two sufficient conditions that generalize the properties of the LQR
setting, characterizing the fundamental benefit of incorporating stochastic
predictions. We apply this lower bound to non-quadratic costs and show that
even weakly dependent predictions yield significant performance gains.

Motivation: To address the computational intensity of multiple replications in stochastic multi-objective optimization by proposing a single-observation approach.

Method: Uses probabilistic branch and bound with single observations and neighboring solutions for estimation, avoiding multiple replications.

Result: Finite-time performance bounds and asymptotic convergence proven; MOPBnB(so) outperforms NSGA-II and is computationally efficient.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is effective for approximating Pareto optimal sets in stochastic problems with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

*He Chen,Jiajin Li,Anthony Man-cho So*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new structural condition, set smoothness, to compute strong (Clarke) hyper-stationary points in bilevel optimization (BLO) without impractical assumptions, even for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions. A zeroth-order algorithm is proposed with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for BLO either yield weak stationarity or rely on restrictive smoothness assumptions. This work aims to remove these limitations and provide a computable solution for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions.

Method: The authors introduce set smoothness, a structural condition ensuring weak convexity/concavity of hyper-objective functions. They propose a zeroth-order algorithm to compute approximate Clarke hyper-stationary points.

Result: The algorithm guarantees non-asymptotic convergence to Clarke hyper-stationary points, even for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions. Set smoothness is shown to hold for a broad class of BLO problems.

Conclusion: This work advances BLO computability by addressing nonsmoothness and providing practical convergence guarantees. The set smoothness property may inspire further applications in other fields.

Abstract: Solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems to global optimality is generally
intractable. A common alternative is to compute a hyper-stationary point -- a
stationary point of the hyper-objective function formed by
minimizing/maximizing the upper-level function over the lower-level solution
set. However, existing approaches either yield weak notions of stationarity or
rely on restrictive assumptions to ensure the smoothness of hyper-objective
functions. In this paper, we remove these impractical assumptions and show that
strong (Clarke) hyper-stationarity is still computable even when the
hyper-objective is nonsmooth. Our key tool is a new structural condition,
called set smoothness, which captures the variational relationship between the
lower-level solution set and the upper-level variable. We prove that this
condition holds for a broad class of BLO problems and ensures weak convexity
(resp. concavity) of pessimistic (resp. optimistic) hyper-objective functions.
Building on this, we show that a zeroth-order algorithm computes approximate
Clarke hyper-stationary points with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational guarantee for
Clarke-type stationarity for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions in BLO.Our
developments, especially the set smoothness property, contribute to a deeper
understanding of BLO computability and may inspire applications in other
fields.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in decentralized optimization for row-stochastic networks, introducing metrics and a lower bound, and proposes Pull-Diag-GT and MG protocols to achieve near-optimal convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The row-stochastic scenario in decentralized optimization lacks exploration compared to doubly-stochastic and column-stochastic cases, prompting the need for new metrics and algorithms.

Method: The authors introduce Pull-Diag-GT to address descent deviation and multi-step gossip (MG) to resolve instability, achieving linear speedup and near-optimal complexity.

Result: The proposed framework achieves the first convergence lower bound for row-stochastic networks, with Pull-Diag-GT and MG protocols enabling near-optimal performance.

Conclusion: The paper bridges a critical gap in decentralized optimization, providing theoretical and algorithmic advancements for row-stochastic networks.

Abstract: A key challenge in decentralized optimization is determining the optimal
convergence rate and designing algorithms to achieve it. While this problem has
been extensively addressed for doubly-stochastic and column-stochastic mixing
matrices, the row-stochastic scenario remains unexplored. This paper bridges
this gap by introducing effective metrics to capture the influence of
row-stochastic mixing matrices and establishing the first convergence lower
bound for decentralized learning over row-stochastic networks. However,
existing algorithms fail to attain this lower bound due to two key issues:
deviation in the descent direction caused by the adapted gradient tracking (GT)
and instability introduced by the Pull-Diag protocol. To address descent
deviation, we propose a novel analysis framework demonstrating that
Pull-Diag-GT achieves linear speedup, the first such result for row-stochastic
decentralized optimization. Moreover, by incorporating a multi-step gossip (MG)
protocol, we resolve the instability issue and attain the lower bound,
achieving near-optimal complexity for decentralized optimization over
row-stochastic networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving sustainability of AVs by reducing energy consumption and emissions through accurate and optimization-friendly eco-driving strategies.

Method: Proposes ECO+, a convex optimization framework using PCI and piecewise affine approximations for computational efficiency, validated with empirical models.

Result: ECO+ consistently reduces energy consumption better than baseline methods, even under comfort constraints and with leading vehicles.

Conclusion: ECO+ is a practical, scalable, and efficient standalone solution for sustainable AV mobility.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) present a unique opportunity to improve the
sustainability of transportation systems by adopting eco-driving strategies
that reduce energy consumption and emissions. This paper introduces a novel
surrogate model for energy and fuel consumption that minimizes Positive Control
Input (PCI). Unlike conventional objectives such as squared acceleration, which
often misrepresent actual energy usage, PCI provides a more accurate and
optimization-friendly alternative. Building on PCI, we propose ECO+, a convex,
time-based trajectory optimization framework that ensures safety and passenger
comfort while optimizing energy use for AVs approaching an intersection. To
improve computational efficiency, quadratic resistive forces are approximated
using piecewise affine segments, resulting in a linear programming formulation.
ECO+ is validated using empirical fuel and electric energy models and
benchmarked against established optimization strategies, including a
state-of-the-art nonlinear solver. Simulation results demonstrate that ECO+
consistently outperforms baseline methods in reducing energy consumption, even
under strict comfort constraints and in scenarios involving a leading vehicle.
Moreover, initializing a nonlinear solver with ECO+ yields only marginal gains,
indicating that ECO+ is effective as a standalone eco-driving strategy. These
findings highlight ECO+ as a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient
solution for enhancing the sustainability of autonomous urban mobility systems.

*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simplified approach to solving optimal control problems using neural networks, eliminating the need to include cost functions in training by decoupling the problem into a physics-informed training phase and a separate optimization phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods combine cost functions into the training process, complicating the architecture. The authors aim to simplify this by separating the training and optimization phases.

Method: Uses a neural operator (e.g., DeepONet) trained with a physics-informed loss (differential equation residuals). Optimization is performed separately by adding a penalty term to the cost function and computing gradients via automatic differentiation.

Result: Demonstrated on nine optimal control problems with three DeepONet models, achieving accurate and consistent performance across varying cost functions.

Conclusion: Decoupling training and optimization simplifies the architecture and maintains performance, making the approach versatile for multiple optimal control problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

*Rui-Jin Zhang,Ruoyu Diao,Xin-Wei Liu,Yu-Hong Dai*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Newton augmented Lagrangian (NAL) method by combining ALM and IPMs to solve symmetric cone programming problems, achieving better complexity and condition numbers than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nonsmoothness of ALM subproblems prevents direct use of Newton methods, motivating the integration of IPM barrier functions for smoothing.

Method: Combines ALM and IPMs to create a novel augmented Lagrangian function, leveraging barrier functions for smoothing and self-concordance for complexity bounds.

Result: The NAL method achieves an O(ε⁻¹) complexity bound and improves condition numbers of Schur complement matrices, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The NAL method effectively addresses nonsmoothness in ALM subproblems and demonstrates superior performance in numerical experiments.

Abstract: Symmetric cone programming incorporates a broad class of convex optimization
problems, including linear programming, second-order cone programming, and
semidefinite programming. Although the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is
well-suited for large-scale scenarios, its subproblems are often not
second-order continuously differentiable, preventing direct use of classical
Newton methods. To address this issue, we observe that barrier functions from
interior-point methods (IPMs) naturally serve as effective smoothing terms to
alleviate such nonsmoothness. By combining the strengths of ALM and IPMs, we
construct a novel augmented Lagrangian function and subsequently develop a
Newton augmented Lagrangian (NAL) method. By leveraging the self-concordance
property of the barrier function, the proposed method is shown to achieve an
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the condition numbers of the Schur complement matrices in the NAL method are
considerably better than those of classical IPMs, as visually evidenced by a
heatmap of condition numbers. Numerical experiments conducted on standard
benchmarks confirm that the NAL method exhibits significant performance

*Shenglun Yi,Mattia Zorzi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A robust nonlinear state estimation method under model uncertainty is proposed using a dynamic minimax game and sigma point approximation, outperforming existing filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust state estimation under model uncertainty by leveraging game theory and approximation techniques.

Method: Formulates a dynamic minimax game, uses sigma point approximation for the ambiguity set, and employs MCMC for simulating the least favorable model.

Result: Numerical examples demonstrate the proposed filter's superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles model uncertainty and improves estimation robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a robust nonlinear state estimation problem under
model uncertainty by formulating a dynamic minimax game: one player designs the
robust estimator, while the other selects the least favorable model from an
ambiguity set of possible models centered around the nominal one. To
characterize a closed-form expression for the conditional expectation
characterizing the estimator, we approximate the center of this ambiguity set
by means of a sigma point approximation. Furthermore, since the least favorable
model is generally nonlinear and non-Gaussian, we derive a simulator based on a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate data from such model. Finally, some
numerical examples show that the proposed filter outperforms the existing
filters.

Conclusion: The framework enhances flexibility representation and supports future extensions.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are expected to become an increasingly important

the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more
accurate flexibility representations. The proposed framework also provides a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data uncertainty systematically in machine learning model fitting using distributionally robust optimization.

Method: Uses Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization with entropic smoothing for sampling-based approximation. Analyzes convergence of gradients and critical points.

Result: Shows convergence of approximate gradients and concentration of critical points. Provides guarantees for a projected stochastic gradient method.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for handling uncertainty in machine learning, even with unbounded sample spaces and mixed data types.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization offers a compelling framework for model
fitting in machine learning, as it systematically accounts for data
uncertainty. Focusing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, we
investigate the regularized problem where entropic smoothing yields a
sampling-based approximation of the original objective. We establish the
convergence of the approximate gradient over a compact set, leading to the
concentration of the regularized problem critical points onto the original
problem critical set as regularization diminishes and the number of
approximation samples increases. Finally, we deduce convergence guarantees for
a projected stochastic gradient method. Our analysis covers a general machine
learning situation with an unbounded sample space and mixed continuous-discrete
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enable circular formations in unicycles through local interactions without external constraints.

Method: Derived necessary and sufficient conditions for circular formation, designed a distributed control law, and analyzed local stability for small groups.

Result: Circular formations emerge intrinsically from initial conditions, with key features like radius and spacing not externally imposed.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical and analytical insights into spontaneous circular formations in unicycles.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the cyclic pursuit problem of unicycles and study
circular formation from an emergence perspective. We first establish a
systematic study on such formation and derive a necessary and sufficient
condition for its existence. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design
a distributed control law that enables the spontaneous formation of circular
formations through only local interactions. Notably, key geometric features --
including the radius and agent spacing -- are not imposed externally but emerge
intrinsically from the initial conditions of the group. The framework further
includes a local stability analysis for small agent group ($n \leq 3$),
providing analytical insight into the convergence mechanism.

### [38] [Optimal-PhiBE: A PDE-based Model-free framework for Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05208)
*Yuhua Zhu,Yuming Zhang,Haoyu Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimal-PhiBE, a new method for continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) that combines discrete-time observations with continuous-time PDEs, outperforming existing approaches like Optimal-BE in weakly discounted or control-dominant scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CTRL face issues like non-identifiability (model-based PDEs) or large discretization errors (model-free Optimal-BE). Optimal-PhiBE aims to overcome these by integrating discrete-time data into continuous-time PDEs.

Method: Optimal-PhiBE avoids explicit dynamics estimation and reduces discretization errors. It extends to higher orders for better accuracy and includes a model-free policy iteration algorithm for solving it from trajectory data.

Result: Optimal-PhiBE recovers the optimal policy in undiscounted cases and outperforms Optimal-BE in weakly discounted or control-dominant settings. Theoretical error bounds are established, and numerical experiments validate the findings.

Conclusion: Optimal-PhiBE effectively addresses limitations of existing CTRL methods, offering improved performance and accuracy, especially in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This paper addresses continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) where the
system dynamics are governed by a stochastic differential equation but are
unknown, and only discrete-time observations are available. Existing approaches
face limitations: model-based PDE methods suffer from non-identifiability,
while model-free methods based on the optimal Bellman equation (Optimal-BE) are
prone to large discretization errors sensitive to both the dynamics and reward
structure. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Optimal-PhiBE, a
formulation that integrates discrete-time information into a continuous-time
PDE, combining the strength of both existing frameworks while mitigating their
limitations. Optimal-PhiBE avoids explicit dynamics estimation, exhibits
smaller discretization errors when the uncontrolled system evolves slowly, and
demonstrates reduced sensitivity to oscillatory reward structures. In the
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) setting, sharp error bounds are established
for both Optimal-PhiBE and Optimal-BE. The results show that Optimal-PhiBE
exactly recovers the optimal policy in the undiscounted case and substantially
outperforms Optimal-BE when the problem is weakly discounted or
control-dominant. Furthermore, we extend Optimal-PhiBE to higher orders,
providing increasingly accurate approximations. A model-free policy iteration
algorithm is proposed to solve the Optimal-PhiBE directly from trajectory data.
Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Robust finite-time feedback controller introduced for the second-order

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem models real-world applications with hard constraints, requiring conflict-free assignments while minimizing cost.

Method: A mixed integer linear program is solved using the open-source CP-SAT solver from Google OR-Tools.

Result: The approach matches state-of-the-art solvers and provides faster, better heuristic solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple yet effective, outperforming existing heuristics and competing with advanced solvers.

Abstract: A variant of the well-known Assignment Problem is studied in this paper,
where pairs of assignments are conflicting, and cannot be selected at the same
time. This configures a set of hard constraints. The problem, which models real
applications, looks for a complete assignment that minimizes the total cost,
while no conflict is violated. In this paper, we consider a previously known
mixed integer linear program representing the problem and we solve it with the
open-source solver CP-SAT, part of the Google OR-Tools computational suite. An
experimental campaign on the instances available from the literature, indicates
that the approach we propose achieves results comparable with, those of
state-of-the-art solvers, notwithstanding its intrinsic conceptual and
implementation simplicity. The solver adopted is also able to provide heuristic
solutions quicker and better than the heuristic methods previously discussed in
the literature.

*Yiheng Lin,Christopher Yeh,Zaiwei Chen,Adam Wierman*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper examines the value of stochastic predictions in online optimal control, introducing 'prediction power' to quantify cost improvement from using predictions. It provides closed-form expressions for LQR settings and generalizes findings to broader dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks stochastic dependence between predictions and disturbances, limiting performance guarantees. This paper aims to address this gap by modeling their joint distribution.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for joint distribution modeling, define 'prediction power,' derive closed-form expressions for LQR, and generalize results to non-LQR settings with sufficient conditions.

Result: Closed-form expressions for prediction power in LQR are derived, and a lower bound for general dynamics is established, showing significant gains even with weakly dependent predictions.

Conclusion: Stochastic predictions offer substantial control cost improvements, with prediction power providing a more nuanced metric than accuracy alone, applicable beyond LQR settings.

Abstract: We study the value of stochastic predictions in online optimal control with
random disturbances. Prior work provides performance guarantees based on
prediction error but ignores the stochastic dependence between predictions and
disturbances. We introduce a general framework modeling their joint
distribution and define "prediction power" as the control cost improvement from
the optimal use of predictions compared to ignoring the predictions. In the
time-varying Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting, we derive a closed-form
expression for prediction power and discuss its mismatch with prediction
accuracy and connection with online policy optimization. To extend beyond LQR,
we study general dynamics and costs. We establish a lower bound of prediction
power under two sufficient conditions that generalize the properties of the LQR
setting, characterizing the fundamental benefit of incorporating stochastic
predictions. We apply this lower bound to non-quadratic costs and show that
even weakly dependent predictions yield significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity of multiple replications in stochastic multi-objective optimization, MOPBnB(so) offers a more efficient alternative.

Method: Evaluates noisy functions once per solution, using neighboring solutions for estimation, with finite-time and asymptotic convergence guarantees.

Result: MOPBnB(so) captures the Pareto optimal set efficiently, outperforming NSGA-II and reducing computational resource usage.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is a promising, resource-efficient algorithm for stochastic multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

### [43] [Set Smoothness Unlocks Clarke Hyper-stationarity in Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04587)
*He Chen,Jiajin Li,Anthony Man-cho So*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems by introducing a new structural condition, set smoothness, which enables the computation of strong (Clarke) hyper-stationary points even for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization problems are generally intractable to solve globally. Existing methods either provide weak stationarity guarantees or rely on impractical smoothness assumptions for hyper-objective functions. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a new structural condition, set smoothness, to analyze the variational relationship between the lower-level solution set and the upper-level variable. They prove this condition ensures weak convexity/concavity of hyper-objective functions and develop a zeroth-order algorithm to compute approximate Clarke hyper-stationary points.

Result: The paper demonstrates that strong (Clarke) hyper-stationarity is computable for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions, with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: The set smoothness property advances the understanding of BLO computability and opens avenues for applications in other fields. This is the first computational guarantee for Clarke-type stationarity in nonsmooth BLO.

Abstract: Solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems to global optimality is generally
intractable. A common alternative is to compute a hyper-stationary point -- a
stationary point of the hyper-objective function formed by
minimizing/maximizing the upper-level function over the lower-level solution
set. However, existing approaches either yield weak notions of stationarity or
rely on restrictive assumptions to ensure the smoothness of hyper-objective
functions. In this paper, we remove these impractical assumptions and show that
strong (Clarke) hyper-stationarity is still computable even when the
hyper-objective is nonsmooth. Our key tool is a new structural condition,
called set smoothness, which captures the variational relationship between the
lower-level solution set and the upper-level variable. We prove that this
condition holds for a broad class of BLO problems and ensures weak convexity
(resp. concavity) of pessimistic (resp. optimistic) hyper-objective functions.
Building on this, we show that a zeroth-order algorithm computes approximate
Clarke hyper-stationary points with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational guarantee for
Clarke-type stationarity for nonsmooth hyper-objective functions in BLO.Our
developments, especially the set smoothness property, contribute to a deeper
understanding of BLO computability and may inspire applications in other
fields.

### [44] [Achieving Linear Speedup and Near-Optimal Complexity for Decentralized Optimization over Row-stochastic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04600)
*Liyuan Liang,Xinyi Chen,Gan Luo,Kun Yuan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in decentralized optimization for row-stochastic networks, introducing metrics and a convergence lower bound. It proposes Pull-Diag-GT for linear speedup and a multi-step gossip protocol to achieve near-optimal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The row-stochastic scenario in decentralized optimization lacks exploration compared to doubly-stochastic and column-stochastic cases. The paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing convergence and improving algorithms.

Method: The paper introduces metrics for row-stochastic matrices, proposes Pull-Diag-GT for linear speedup, and uses a multi-step gossip protocol to address instability.

Result: The paper establishes the first convergence lower bound for row-stochastic networks and achieves near-optimal complexity with the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The study bridges a critical gap in decentralized optimization, providing theoretical and algorithmic advancements for row-stochastic networks.

Abstract: A key challenge in decentralized optimization is determining the optimal
convergence rate and designing algorithms to achieve it. While this problem has
been extensively addressed for doubly-stochastic and column-stochastic mixing
matrices, the row-stochastic scenario remains unexplored. This paper bridges
this gap by introducing effective metrics to capture the influence of
row-stochastic mixing matrices and establishing the first convergence lower
bound for decentralized learning over row-stochastic networks. However,
existing algorithms fail to attain this lower bound due to two key issues:
deviation in the descent direction caused by the adapted gradient tracking (GT)
and instability introduced by the Pull-Diag protocol. To address descent
deviation, we propose a novel analysis framework demonstrating that
Pull-Diag-GT achieves linear speedup, the first such result for row-stochastic
decentralized optimization. Moreover, by incorporating a multi-step gossip (MG)
protocol, we resolve the instability issue and attain the lower bound,
achieving near-optimal complexity for decentralized optimization over
row-stochastic networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sustainability of AVs by accurately optimizing energy use while ensuring safety and comfort, addressing limitations of conventional objectives like squared acceleration.

Method: Proposes ECO+, a time-based trajectory optimization framework using PCI and piecewise affine approximations for computational efficiency, validated with empirical models.

Result: ECO+ reduces energy consumption more effectively than baseline methods, even under comfort constraints and with leading vehicles, and performs nearly as well as nonlinear solvers.

Conclusion: ECO+ is a practical, scalable, and efficient solution for sustainable AV mobility, with standalone effectiveness comparable to more complex methods.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) present a unique opportunity to improve the
sustainability of transportation systems by adopting eco-driving strategies
that reduce energy consumption and emissions. This paper introduces a novel
surrogate model for energy and fuel consumption that minimizes Positive Control
Input (PCI). Unlike conventional objectives such as squared acceleration, which
often misrepresent actual energy usage, PCI provides a more accurate and
optimization-friendly alternative. Building on PCI, we propose ECO+, a convex,
time-based trajectory optimization framework that ensures safety and passenger
comfort while optimizing energy use for AVs approaching an intersection. To
improve computational efficiency, quadratic resistive forces are approximated
using piecewise affine segments, resulting in a linear programming formulation.
ECO+ is validated using empirical fuel and electric energy models and
benchmarked against established optimization strategies, including a
state-of-the-art nonlinear solver. Simulation results demonstrate that ECO+
consistently outperforms baseline methods in reducing energy consumption, even
under strict comfort constraints and in scenarios involving a leading vehicle.
Moreover, initializing a nonlinear solver with ECO+ yields only marginal gains,
indicating that ECO+ is effective as a standalone eco-driving strategy. These
findings highlight ECO+ as a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient
solution for enhancing the sustainability of autonomous urban mobility systems.

*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simpler neural network approach for solving optimal control problems by decoupling training from optimization, using a single physics-informed training phase followed by optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods combine cost functions in training, complicating the process. The authors aim to simplify this by separating training and optimization.

Method: Uses a neural operator (e.g., DeepONet) with a penalty term for differential equation residuals. Optimization is done via automatic differentiation in an iterative routine.

Result: Demonstrated on nine problems with three DeepONet models, achieving accurate performance across varying cost functions.

Conclusion: Decoupling training and optimization simplifies solving optimal control problems without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Newton augmented Lagrangian (NAL) method by combining ALM and IPMs to solve symmetric cone programming, achieving better complexity and condition numbers than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nonsmoothness of ALM subproblems prevents direct use of Newton methods, motivating the integration of IPM barrier functions for smoothing.

Method: Combines ALM and IPMs to create a novel augmented Lagrangian function, leveraging barrier functions for smoothing and self-concordance for complexity bounds.

Result: The NAL method achieves an O(ε⁻¹) complexity bound and better condition numbers for Schur complement matrices, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The NAL method effectively addresses nonsmoothness in ALM subproblems, offering improved performance and scalability for symmetric cone programming.

Abstract: Symmetric cone programming incorporates a broad class of convex optimization
problems, including linear programming, second-order cone programming, and
semidefinite programming. Although the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is
well-suited for large-scale scenarios, its subproblems are often not
second-order continuously differentiable, preventing direct use of classical
Newton methods. To address this issue, we observe that barrier functions from
interior-point methods (IPMs) naturally serve as effective smoothing terms to
alleviate such nonsmoothness. By combining the strengths of ALM and IPMs, we
construct a novel augmented Lagrangian function and subsequently develop a
Newton augmented Lagrangian (NAL) method. By leveraging the self-concordance
property of the barrier function, the proposed method is shown to achieve an
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the condition numbers of the Schur complement matrices in the NAL method are
considerably better than those of classical IPMs, as visually evidenced by a
heatmap of condition numbers. Numerical experiments conducted on standard
benchmarks confirm that the NAL method exhibits significant performance
improvements compared to several existing methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic minimax game and simulation approach effectively solve robust nonlinear state estimation under uncertainty.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a robust nonlinear state estimation problem under
model uncertainty by formulating a dynamic minimax game: one player designs the
robust estimator, while the other selects the least favorable model from an
ambiguity set of possible models centered around the nominal one. To
characterize a closed-form expression for the conditional expectation
characterizing the estimator, we approximate the center of this ambiguity set
by means of a sigma point approximation. Furthermore, since the least favorable

Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate data from such model. Finally, some
numerical examples show that the proposed filter outperforms the existing
filters.

Motivation: To address data uncertainty in machine learning systematically by leveraging distributionally robust optimization.

Method: Uses entropic smoothing for sampling-based approximation of the objective, analyzes gradient convergence, and applies a projected stochastic gradient method.

Result: Shows convergence of approximate gradients and concentration of critical points, with guarantees for the stochastic gradient method.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for handling uncertainty in machine learning, even with unbounded sample spaces and mixed data types.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization offers a compelling framework for model
fitting in machine learning, as it systematically accounts for data
uncertainty. Focusing on Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, we
investigate the regularized problem where entropic smoothing yields a
sampling-based approximation of the original objective. We establish the
convergence of the approximate gradient over a compact set, leading to the
concentration of the regularized problem critical points onto the original
problem critical set as regularization diminishes and the number of
approximation samples increases. Finally, we deduce convergence guarantees for
a projected stochastic gradient method. Our analysis covers a general machine
learning situation with an unbounded sample space and mixed continuous-discrete
data.

### [52] [An emergence-oriented approach to cyclic pursuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05157)
*Zhaozhan Yao,Yuhua Yao,Xiaoming Hu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Study of circular formation in unicycles via cyclic pursuit, deriving conditions for existence and designing a distributed control law for emergent formations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enable spontaneous circular formations in unicycles through local interactions, without external imposition of geometric features.

Method: Derived necessary and sufficient conditions for circular formation, designed a distributed control law, and analyzed local stability for small groups (n ≤ 3).

Result: Circular formations emerge intrinsically from initial conditions, with key features like radius and spacing not externally imposed.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical and analytical insights into emergent circular formations in cyclic pursuit problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the cyclic pursuit problem of unicycles and study
circular formation from an emergence perspective. We first establish a
systematic study on such formation and derive a necessary and sufficient
condition for its existence. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design
a distributed control law that enables the spontaneous formation of circular
formations through only local interactions. Notably, key geometric features --
including the radius and agent spacing -- are not imposed externally but emerge
intrinsically from the initial conditions of the group. The framework further
includes a local stability analysis for small agent group ($n \leq 3$),
providing analytical insight into the convergence mechanism.

### [53] [Optimal-PhiBE: A PDE-based Model-free framework for Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05208)
*Yuhua Zhu,Yuming Zhang,Haoyu Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimal-PhiBE, a new method for continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) that combines discrete-time observations with continuous-time PDEs, overcoming limitations of existing approaches like non-identifiability and discretization errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CTRL, such as model-based PDEs and model-free Optimal-BE, face issues like non-identifiability and sensitivity to dynamics/reward structures. Optimal-PhiBE aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: Optimal-PhiBE integrates discrete-time observations into a continuous-time PDE without explicit dynamics estimation. It reduces discretization errors and sensitivity to oscillatory rewards. A model-free policy iteration algorithm is proposed for solving it.

Result: Optimal-PhiBE outperforms Optimal-BE, especially in weakly discounted or control-dominant scenarios, and recovers the optimal policy in undiscounted cases. Higher-order extensions improve accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimal-PhiBE is a robust framework for CTRL, combining strengths of existing methods while mitigating their weaknesses, validated by theoretical bounds and numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper addresses continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) where the
system dynamics are governed by a stochastic differential equation but are
unknown, and only discrete-time observations are available. Existing approaches
face limitations: model-based PDE methods suffer from non-identifiability,
while model-free methods based on the optimal Bellman equation (Optimal-BE) are
prone to large discretization errors sensitive to both the dynamics and reward
structure. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Optimal-PhiBE, a
formulation that integrates discrete-time information into a continuous-time
PDE, combining the strength of both existing frameworks while mitigating their
limitations. Optimal-PhiBE avoids explicit dynamics estimation, exhibits
smaller discretization errors when the uncontrolled system evolves slowly, and
demonstrates reduced sensitivity to oscillatory reward structures. In the
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) setting, sharp error bounds are established
for both Optimal-PhiBE and Optimal-BE. The results show that Optimal-PhiBE
exactly recovers the optimal policy in the undiscounted case and substantially
outperforms Optimal-BE when the problem is weakly discounted or
control-dominant. Furthermore, we extend Optimal-PhiBE to higher orders,
providing increasingly accurate approximations. A model-free policy iteration
algorithm is proposed to solve the Optimal-PhiBE directly from trajectory data.
Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regularization scheme to reduce chattering in a non-overshooting quasi-continuous sliding mode control for second-order systems, supported by ISS and iISS proofs and numerical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical limitations of chattering in discontinuous control systems, particularly for second-order systems.

Method: Proposes a regularization scheme to suppress chattering, with detailed analysis using ISS (Input-to-State Stability) and iISS (integral Input-to-State Stability) proofs.

Result: The scheme effectively reduces chattering while maintaining control performance, validated by numerical results.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization improves practicality of the control method for real-world applications.

Abstract: Robust finite-time feedback controller introduced for the second-order
systems in [1] can be seen as a non-overshooting quasi-continuous sliding mode
control. The paper proposes a regularization scheme to suppress inherent
chattering due to discontinuity of the control [1] in the origin, in favor of
practical applications. A detailed analysis with ISS and iISS proofs are
provided along with supporting numerical results.

Abstract: A bounded linear operator $T$ on a Banach space $X$ (not necessarily

say $J_T(x)$ equals $X$ for some vector $x\in X$. Practically, the extended

Motivation: The problem is significant as it remains unresolved despite prior studies, and it is listed as the third open problem in a classical reference.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel method to address the well-posedness issue in the 3D Prandtl equation, overcoming symmetry-breaking challenges.

Abstract: The well-posedness of the three dimensional Prandtl equation is an

Result: The method uniquely identifies the obstacle's shape and location without initial guesses or background medium knowledge.

Conclusion: The approach effectively solves the inverse problem for rigid elastic obstacles using far-field measurements.

Abstract: We consider the elastic wave scattering problem involving rigid obstacles.
This work addresses the inverse problem of reconstructing the position and
shape of such obstacles using far-field measurements. A novel
monotonicity-based approach is developed for this purpose. By factorizing the

derive a shape characterization criterion for the obstacle boundary. The
proposed method employs monotonicity tests to determine the geometric
relationship between any given test domain and the actual scatterer. As a
result, the shape and location of rigid elastic obstacles can be uniquely
identified without requiring any initial guesses or prior knowledge of the
physical parameters of the homogeneous background medium.

Abstract: We consider a macroscopic model for the dynamics of living tissues
incorporating pressure-driven dispersal and pressure-modulated proliferation.
Given a power-law constitutive relation between the pressure and cell density,
the model can be written as a porous medium equation with a growth term. We
prove Lipschitz continuity of the mild solutions of the model with respect to
the diffusion parameter (the exponent $\gamma$ in the pressure-density law) in
the $L_1$ norm. While of independent analytical interest, our motivation for
this result is to provide a vital step towards using Bayesian inverse problem
methodology for parameter estimation based on experimental data -- such
stability estimates are indispensable for applying sampling algorithms which
rely on the gradient of the likelihood function.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper investigates the existence and multiplicity of nontrivial solitary waves for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation under an L²-norm constraint. It establishes normalized ground state solutions for subcritical and supercritical cases and explores additional solutions for specific nonlinearities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the existence of normalized solutions for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, a problem not previously explored under L² constraints.

Method: The authors analyze the equation with prescribed L²-norm, using Lagrange multipliers and energy functional methods to derive solutions for subcritical and supercritical cases, as well as for combined nonlinearities.

Result: Existence of normalized ground state solutions is proven for both subcritical and supercritical cases. For combined nonlinearities, a second solution with positive energy is shown to exist for specific parameter sequences.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the study of normalized solutions for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, providing foundational results for future research in this area.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and {multiplicity} of nontrivial
solitary waves for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation with
prescribed {$L^2$-norm} \begin{equation*}\label{Equation1}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  \left(-u_{x x}+D_x^{-2} u_{y y}+\lambda u-f(u)\right)_x=0,{\quad x \in
\mathbb{R}^2, } \\[10pt]
  \displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}u^2 d x=a^2,
  \end{array}\right.%\tag{$\mathscr E_\lambda$} \end{equation*} where $a>0$ and
$\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is an unknown parameter that appears as a Lagrange
multiplier. For the case $f(t)=|t|^{q-2}t$, with $2<q<\frac{10}{3}$
($L^2$-subcritical case) and $\frac{10}{3}<q<6$ ($L^2$-supercritical case), we
establish the existence of normalized ground state solutions for the above
equation. Moreover, when $f(t)=\mu|t|^{q-2}t+|t|^{p-2}t$, with
$2<q<\frac{10}{3}<p<6$ and $\mu>0$, we prove the existence of normalized ground
state solutions which corresponds to a local minimum of the associated energy
functional. In this case, we further show that there exists a sequence $(a_n)
\subset (0,a_0)$ with $a_n \to 0$ as $n \to+\infty$, such that for each
$a=a_n$, the problem admits a second solution with positive energy. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the existence of
solutions for the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations under the
$L^2$-constraint, which we refer to them as the normalized solutions.

TL;DR: The paper proves that uniformly rotating solutions of the 2D Euler equation with compactly supported vorticity must be radially symmetric under certain angular velocity conditions, extending previous results to include irregular patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and refine existing rigidity theorems for rotating solutions of the 2D Euler equation, removing restrictions on angular velocity and vorticity sign, and accommodating irregular vortex patches.

Method: Analyzes uniformly rotating solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation, focusing on compactly supported vorticity and specific angular velocity ranges.

Result: Shows radial symmetry is necessary for solutions when angular velocity lies outside the interval (inf ω/2, sup ω/2), even for irregular patches.

Conclusion: Extends previous work by relaxing constraints and broadening applicability to irregular vortex patches, enhancing understanding of rotating fluid dynamics.

Abstract: We prove that any uniformly rotating solution of the 2D incompressible Euler
equation with compactly supported vorticity $\omega$ must be radially symmetric
whenever its angular velocity satisfies $\Omega \in (-\infty,\inf \omega / 2]
\cup \, [ \sup \omega / 2, +\infty )$, in both the patch and smooth settings.
This result extends the rigidity theorems established in
\cite{Gom2021MR4312192} (\textit{Duke Math. J.},170(13):2957-3038, 2021), which
were confined to the case of non-positive angular velocities and non-negative
vorticity. Moreover, our results do not impose any regularity conditions on the
patch beyond requiring that its boundary consists of Jordan curves, thereby
refining the previous result to encompass irregular vortex patches.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Extension of Rivière's theorem to fractional harmonic maps, showing infinitely many homotopy classes with minimizers in π₃(S²).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Rivière's 1998 result on minimizing 3-harmonic maps to the fractional setting, addressing the surprising contrast with π₃(S³).

Method: Use fractional harmonic maps (W^{s,3/s}-harmonic) for s ∈ (0,1) to analyze homotopy classes in π₃(S²).

Result: Infinitely many homotopy classes in π₃(S²) admit minimizing fractional harmonic maps.

Conclusion: The fractional framework broadens the understanding of minimizing harmonic maps, extending Rivière's findings.

Abstract: In 1998 T. Rivi\`{e}re proved that there exist infinitely many homotopy
classes of $\pi_3(\mathbb S^2)$ having a minimizing 3-harmonic map. This result
is especially surprising taking into account that in $\pi_3(\mathbb S^3)$ there
are only three homotopy classes (corresponding to the degrees $\{-1,0,1\}$) in
which a minimizer exists.
  We extend this theorem in the framework of fractional harmonic maps and prove
that for $s\in(0,1)$ there exist infinitely many homotopy classes of
$\pi_{3}(\mathbb S^{2})$ in which there is a minimizing
$W^{s,\frac{3}{s}}$-harmonic map.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation is globally
well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s > -\frac12$. The
previous record for well-posedness was $s\geq 0$, and the system is known to be
ill-posed for $s<-\frac12$. We then demonstrate that the solutions of ILW
converge to those of the Benjamin--Ono equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ in the
infinite-depth limit.
  Our methods do not rely on the complete integrability of ILW, but rather
treat ILW as a perturbation of the Benjamin--Ono equation by a linear term of
order zero. To highlight this, we establish a general well-posedness result for
such perturbations, which also applies to the Smith equation for
continental-shelf waves.

TL;DR: The paper establishes boundary regularity results for degenerate elliptic equations in the Heisenberg group, focusing on bounded coefficients and right-hand side, with new intrinsic expansions for solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of boundary regularity results for degenerate elliptic equations in non-divergence form within the Heisenberg group, especially for operators with bounded coefficients.

Method: The study uses techniques for degenerate elliptic equations, imposing dimensional restrictions on ellipticity and growth conditions for source terms near boundary points.

Result: Proves Hölder and Lipschitz regularity at the boundary and derives an intrinsic second-order expansion for solutions in a characteristic half-space.

Conclusion: The work extends understanding of boundary regularity in degenerate elliptic equations, providing new insights even for well-studied cases like the sub-Laplacian.

Abstract: We prove boundary H\"older and Lipschitz regularity for a class of degenerate
elliptic, second order, inhomogeneous equations in non-divergence form
structured on the left-invariant vector fields of the Heisenberg group. Our
focus is on the case of operators with bounded and measurable coefficients and
bounded right-hand side; when necessary, we impose a dimensional restriction on
the ellipticity ratio and a growth rate for the source term near characteristic
points of the boundary. For solutions in the characteristic half-space
$\{t>0\}$, we obtain an intrinsic second order expansion near the origin when
the source term belongs to an appropriate weighted $L^{\infty}$ space; this is
a new result even for the frequently studied sub-Laplacian.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the $Q$-tensor

TL;DR: The paper explores a functional for piecewise constant functions with jump penalization and fidelity to a linear forcing term, revealing symmetry breaking in 2D leading to exotic minimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how jump penalization and fidelity to a forcing term influence minimizers in piecewise constant functions, especially in higher dimensions.

Method: Uses the calibration method for free discontinuity problems to analyze minimizers.

Result: In 2D, symmetry breaking occurs, producing exotic minimizers with non-simple level sets.

Conclusion: The study highlights dimensional differences in minimizer behavior, with 2D exhibiting complex patterns not seen in 1D.

Abstract: We study a functional defined on the class of piecewise constant functions,
combining a jump penalization, which discourages discontinuities, with a
fidelity term that penalizes deviations from a given linear function, called
the forcing term.
  In one dimension, it is not difficult to see that local minimizers form
staircases that approximate the forcing term. Here we show that in two
dimensions symmetry breaking occurs, leading to the emergence of exotic
minimizers whose level sets are not simple stripes with boundaries orthogonal
to the gradient of the forcing term.
  The proof relies on the calibration method for free discontinuity problems.

Abstract: We consider the inner limit system describing the phase separation in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The well-posedness of the 3D Prandtl equation is a major unsolved problem, highlighted as the third open problem in Oleinik and Samokhin's book.

Method: A new approach is introduced, involving intrinsic vector fields and novel maximum principles, with emphasis on curvature-type quantities from commutators.

Result: The study overcomes symmetry-breaking challenges, providing insights into the structural stability of background profiles.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of the 3D Prandtl equation's well-posedness in the steady case, offering a novel methodological framework.

Abstract: The well-posedness of the three dimensional Prandtl equation is an
outstanding open problem due to the appearance of the secondary flow even
though there are studies on analytic and Gevrey function spaces. This problem
is raised as the third open problem in the classical book by Oleinik and
Samokhin [43]. This paper aims to address this open problem in the steady case
by introducing a new approach to study the structural stability of background
profile that includes the famous Blasius solutions. The key observations
include the introduction of some intrinsic vector fields and new versions of
maximum principle. In particular, we overcome the difficulties caused by
symmetry breaking through the analysis on the curvature-type quantities
generated by commutators of the vector fields.

Motivation: Little is known about the asymptotic behavior of solutions near singular boundaries, unlike smooth boundaries.

Method: Analyze solutions to the singular Yamabe problem with negative scalar curvature near singular boundaries, focusing on non-conformally flat metrics.

Result: Optimal estimates for the background metric are derived, and solutions are shown to approximate tangent cone solutions at singular points.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the behavior of solutions near singular boundaries, generalizing beyond conformally flat metrics.

Abstract: The boundary behavior of the singular Yamabe problem has been extensively
studied near sufficiently smooth boundaries, while less is known about the
asymptotic behavior of solutions near singular boundaries. In this paper, we
study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the singular Yamabe problem with

Motivation: To solve the inverse problem of identifying the position and shape of rigid obstacles in elastic wave scattering.

Method: Uses a monotonicity-based approach, factorizing the far-field operator and leveraging localized wave functions to derive a shape characterization criterion.

Result: The method uniquely identifies the shape and location of obstacles without needing initial guesses or background medium parameters.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reconstructs rigid elastic obstacles, offering a robust solution to the inverse scattering problem.

Abstract: We consider the elastic wave scattering problem involving rigid obstacles.
This work addresses the inverse problem of reconstructing the position and
shape of such obstacles using far-field measurements. A novel
monotonicity-based approach is developed for this purpose. By factorizing the
far-field operator and utilizing the existence of localized wave functions, we
derive a shape characterization criterion for the obstacle boundary. The
proposed method employs monotonicity tests to determine the geometric
relationship between any given test domain and the actual scatterer. As a
result, the shape and location of rigid elastic obstacles can be uniquely
identified without requiring any initial guesses or prior knowledge of the
physical parameters of the homogeneous background medium.

$f,g$ are also continuous on $[0,\infty)$, respectively $(0,\infty)$. The
mapping $g$ may have an attractive singularity (i.e. $g(x) \to +\infty$ as

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation is globally
well-posed in the Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s > -\frac12$. The
previous record for well-posedness was $s\geq 0$, and the system is known to be
ill-posed for $s<-\frac12$. We then demonstrate that the solutions of ILW
converge to those of the Benjamin--Ono equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ in the
infinite-depth limit.
  Our methods do not rely on the complete integrability of ILW, but rather
treat ILW as a perturbation of the Benjamin--Ono equation by a linear term of
order zero. To highlight this, we establish a general well-posedness result for
such perturbations, which also applies to the Smith equation for
continental-shelf waves.

### [93] [Boundary regularity for subelliptic equations in the Heisenberg group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05151)
*Farhan Abedin,Giulio Tralli*

TL;DR: The paper establishes boundary Hölder and Lipschitz regularity for degenerate elliptic equations in the Heisenberg group, focusing on bounded coefficients and right-hand side, with new results for intrinsic expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address regularity issues for degenerate elliptic equations in non-divergence form, particularly in the Heisenberg group, where existing results are limited.

Method: Analyzes solutions using left-invariant vector fields, imposes dimensional restrictions on ellipticity, and studies growth rates near boundary points.

Result: Proves boundary regularity and derives an intrinsic second-order expansion for solutions in a characteristic half-space, extending known results.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights into the regularity of solutions for degenerate elliptic equations, even for well-studied cases like the sub-Laplacian.

Abstract: We prove boundary H\"older and Lipschitz regularity for a class of degenerate
elliptic, second order, inhomogeneous equations in non-divergence form
structured on the left-invariant vector fields of the Heisenberg group. Our
focus is on the case of operators with bounded and measurable coefficients and
bounded right-hand side; when necessary, we impose a dimensional restriction on
the ellipticity ratio and a growth rate for the source term near characteristic
points of the boundary. For solutions in the characteristic half-space
$\{t>0\}$, we obtain an intrinsic second order expansion near the origin when
the source term belongs to an appropriate weighted $L^{\infty}$ space; this is
a new result even for the frequently studied sub-Laplacian.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the $Q$-tensor
model for liquid crystal flows in the half-space. Our purpose is to show the
$\mathcal{R}$-boundedness for the solution operator families of the resolvent
problem when the resolvent parameter lies near the origin. The definition of
the $\mathcal{R}$-solvability implies the uniform boundedness of the operator
and, consequently, the resolvent estimates for the linear system.

*Massimo Gobbino,Nicola Picenni*

TL;DR: The paper explores a functional for piecewise constant functions with jump penalization and fidelity to a linear forcing term. In 2D, symmetry breaking leads to exotic minimizers with complex level sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how minimizers behave in higher dimensions for functionals combining jump penalization and fidelity to a forcing term.

Method: Uses the calibration method for free discontinuity problems to analyze minimizers.

Result: In 2D, symmetry breaking occurs, producing exotic minimizers with non-simple level sets.

Conclusion: The study reveals complex behavior in higher dimensions, contrasting with simpler 1D results.

Abstract: We study a functional defined on the class of piecewise constant functions,
combining a jump penalization, which discourages discontinuities, with a
fidelity term that penalizes deviations from a given linear function, called
the forcing term.
  In one dimension, it is not difficult to see that local minimizers form
staircases that approximate the forcing term. Here we show that in two
dimensions symmetry breaking occurs, leading to the emergence of exotic
minimizers whose level sets are not simple stripes with boundaries orthogonal
to the gradient of the forcing term.
  The proof relies on the calibration method for free discontinuity problems.

Main category: math.PR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between the Bakry-Émery $N$-Ricci tensor and gradient estimates in DBM, particularly for small inverse temperatures ($0<\beta<1$).

Method: Analyzes the weighted space $(\mathbb R^n, w_\beta)$ with $w_\beta=\prod_{i<j}^n |x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and evaluates ${\rm Ric}_N$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ for different $\beta$ and $N$.

Result: For $\beta \ge 1$, both ${\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold. For $0 < \beta < 1$, ${\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds but ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does not, indicating a phase transition.

Conclusion: The study reveals a phase transition in DBM's curvature bounds for small inverse temperatures, highlighting a gap between ${\rm Ric}_N$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$.

Abstract: In this paper, we find a gap between the lower bound of the Bakry-\'Emery

|x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and any $N\in[n+\frac{\beta}{2}n(n-1),+\infty]$,
  $\beta \ge 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0 \ \& \ {\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold;
  $0 < \beta < 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds while ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does
not, which shows a phase transition of the Dyson Brownian motion regarding the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of eigenvalues in large random matrices and their convergence to extreme value distributions, specifically the Gumbel distribution.

Method: The study uses complex random matrices with i.i.d. entries and analyzes the scaled maximum real part of eigenvalues, proving convergence rates to the Gumbel distribution.

Result: The paper establishes explicit convergence rates for the distribution of the scaled maximum real eigenvalue to the Gumbel distribution, including bounds on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: The results provide precise rates of convergence for the distribution of the scaled maximum real eigenvalue of a random matrix to the Gumbel distribution, enhancing understanding of extreme eigenvalue behavior.

Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) entries $x_{ij} \stackrel{\text { d }}{=} n^{-1 / 2} \xi$ with $\xi$
being a complex random variable of mean zero and variance one. Let
$\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X,$ and $R_n:=\max_i \Re
\sigma_i$ and $Z_n$ be some scaled version of $R_n.$ It was proved that $Z_n$
converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ under certain moment
conditions on $\xi.$ We further prove that for a complex random matrix with
i.i.d. entries
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{25\log
\log n}{4e \log n}(1+o(1))$$

Motivation: Understand the behavior of particles in a branching Lévy process when they are killed upon crossing below zero, particularly the impact of drift and reproduction rates.

Result: Provides insights into the tail behavior of absorbed particles under varying drift and reproduction conditions.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the extinction dynamics and boundary absorption in spectrally negative branching Lévy processes.

Abstract: We consider a spectrally negative branching L{\'e}vy process in which
particles are killed upon crossing below zero. It is known that such a process
becomes extinct almost surely if the drift toward -$\infty$ is sufficiently

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to answer questions posed by Forsström, Gantert, and Steif regarding the properties of such random sets, including their relationship to IID processes and Bernoulli percolation.

Method: The authors analyze random sets formed by independently selecting finite subsets of integers with translation-invariant probabilities, focusing on cases where selected sets are pairs or have exponential moments in size distribution.

Result: Key findings include: (1) random sets are finitary factors of IID processes under certain conditions, (2) stochastic dominance by Bernoulli percolation requires finite exponential moments, and (3) partial results on phase transitions.

Conclusion: The paper provides answers to several questions about random sets, highlighting the role of exponential moments and extending results to higher dimensions.

Abstract: Construct a random set by independently selecting each finite subset of the
integers with some probability depending on the set up to translations and
taking the union of the selected sets. We show that when the only sets selected
with positive probability are pairs, such a random set is a finitary factor of
an IID process, answering a question of Forsstr\"om, Gantert and Steif. More
generally, we show that this is the case whenever the distribution induced by
the size of the selected sets has sufficient exponential moments, and that the
existence of some exponential moment is necessary. We further show that such a
random set is stochastically dominated by a non-trivial Bernoulli percolation
if and only if there is a finite exponential moment, thereby partially
answering another question of Forsstr\"om et al. We also give a partial answer
to a third question regarding a form of phase transition. These results also
hold on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d \ge 2$. In the one-dimensional case, under the
condition that the distribution induced by the diameter of the selected sets
has an exponential moment, we further show that such a random set is finitarily
isomorphic to an IID process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the well-posedness and asymptotic properties of stochastic third-grade fluids, addressing challenges like nonlinear terms and unbounded domains.

Method: Proves unique weak solutions and random dynamical systems, uses compact Sobolev embeddings for bounded domains, and uniform-tail estimates for unbounded domains.

Result: Existence of unique weak solutions and random attractors for bounded and unbounded domains, with invariant measures as a consequence.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the challenges of nonlinearity and unbounded domains, providing insights into the dynamics of stochastic third-grade fluids.

Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade
fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional
Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims
are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of
the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on
$\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under
Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system
$\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using
the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O})
\hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique
random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external
forcing in
$\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$.
Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with
external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a
unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random
attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding
$\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{H}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use
the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic
compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying
system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the
asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis
of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a
consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of
invariant measures for underlying system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend weak existence results for SVEs to non-convolution kernels and ensure solutions remain in closed convex sets.

Method: Introduce an approximation scheme, extend nonnegativity-preserving kernels to non-convolution cases, and apply stochastic invariance properties.

Result: Prove weak existence and uniqueness for SVEs with square-root diffusion coefficients and non-convolution kernels, staying in nonnegative orthant.

Conclusion: Established existence and uniqueness results for SVEs with non-convolution kernels, including a fractional kernel extension, and derived Laplace transform representation.

Abstract: We establish new weak existence results for $d$-dimensional Stochastic
Volterra Equations (SVEs) with continuous coefficients and possibly singular
one-dimensional non-convolution kernels. These results are obtained by
introducing an approximation scheme and showing its convergence. A particular
emphasis is made on the stochastic invariance of the solution in a closed
convex set. To do so, we extend the notion of kernels that preserve
nonnegativity introduced in \cite{Alfonsi23} to non-convolution kernels and
show that, under suitable stochastic invariance property of a closed convex set
by the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equation, there exists a weak
solution of the SVE that stays in this convex set. We present a family of
non-convolution kernels that satisfy our assumptions, including a
non-convolution extension of the well-known fractional kernel. We apply our
results to SVEs with square-root diffusion coefficients and non-convolution
kernels, for which we prove the weak existence and uniqueness of a solution
that stays within the nonnegative orthant. We derive a representation of the
Laplace transform in terms of a non-convolution Riccati equation, for which we
establish an existence result.

Motivation: To generalize the concept of freeness in non-commutative probability theory by introducing real infinitesimal freeness and its associated cumulants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of systems where particles avoid intersection over a moving time window, particularly under the influence of a periodic potential.

Method: Analyzes myopic non-intersecting Brownian motions with a periodic potential, using a modified acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm.

Result: In the long time limit, the system converges to myopic non-intersecting random walks, exhibiting transitions between standard non-intersection and exclusion behavior.

Conclusion: The interplay between potential confinement and repulsion leads to a transition in dynamics, and the introduced algorithm effectively constructs such constrained systems.

Abstract: We introduce a class of Markov processes conditioned to avoid intersection
over a moving time window of length T>0, a setting we refer to as myopic
non-intersection. In particular, we study a system of myopic non-intersecting
Brownian motions subject to a periodic potential. Our focus lies in
understanding the interplay between the confining effect of the potential and
the repulsion induced by the non-intersection constraint. We show that, in the
long time limit, and as both T and the strength of the potential become large,
the model converges to a system of myopic non-intersecting random walks, which
transitions between standard non-intersection dynamics and exclusion behavior.
The main technical contribution of the paper is the introduction of an
algorithm, based on a modification of the acceptance-rejection sampling scheme,
that provides an explicit construction of myopically constrained systems.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a gap in the Bakry-Émery $N$-Ricci tensor and gradient estimate for Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with inverse temperature $0<\beta<1$, showing a phase transition in curvature bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between the Bakry-Émery $N$-Ricci tensor and gradient estimates in DBM, especially for small inverse temperatures.

Method: Analyzes the weighted space $(\mathbb R^n, w_\beta)$ with $w_\beta=\prod_{i<j}^n |x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and evaluates ${\rm Ric}_N$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ for different $\beta$ and $N$.

Result: For $\beta \ge 1$, both ${\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold; for $0 < \beta < 1$, ${\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds but ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does not, indicating a phase transition.

Conclusion: The study reveals a phase transition in DBM's curvature bounds for small inverse temperatures, highlighting a gap between ${\rm Ric}_N$ and ${\sf BE}(0,N)$.

Abstract: In this paper, we find a gap between the lower bound of the Bakry-\'Emery
$N$-Ricci tensor ${\rm Ric}_N$ and the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate ${\sf
BE}$ in the space associated with the finite-particle Dyson Brownian motion
(DBM) with inverse temperature $0<\beta<1$. Namely, we prove that, for the
weighted space $(\mathbb R^n, w_\beta)$ with $w_\beta=\prod_{i<j}^n
|x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and any $N\in[n+\frac{\beta}{2}n(n-1),+\infty]$,
  $\beta \ge 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0 \ \& \ {\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold;
  $0 < \beta < 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds while ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does
not, which shows a phase transition of the Dyson Brownian motion regarding the
Bakry-\'Emery curvature bound in the small inverse temperature regime.

*Yutao Ma,Xinchen Hu*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence of the scaled maximum real part of eigenvalues of a random matrix to the Gumbel distribution, providing precise rates of convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the largest real part of eigenvalues in random matrices and quantify the convergence rate to the Gumbel distribution.

Method: The study uses complex random matrices with i.i.d. entries, analyzing the distribution of the scaled maximum real part of eigenvalues.

Result: The paper proves precise convergence rates for the distribution of the scaled maximum eigenvalue to the Gumbel distribution, with explicit error bounds.

Conclusion: The results provide sharp convergence rates for the Gumbel distribution approximation, enhancing understanding of eigenvalue behavior in random matrices.

Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) entries $x_{ij} \stackrel{\text { d }}{=} n^{-1 / 2} \xi$ with $\xi$
being a complex random variable of mean zero and variance one. Let
$\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X,$ and $R_n:=\max_i \Re
\sigma_i$ and $Z_n$ be some scaled version of $R_n.$ It was proved that $Z_n$
converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ under certain moment
conditions on $\xi.$ We further prove that for a complex random matrix with
i.i.d. entries
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{25\log
\log n}{4e \log n}(1+o(1))$$
  and
  $$ W_1\left(\mathcal{L}(Z_n), \Lambda\right)=\frac{25\log \log n}{4\log
n}(1+o(1))$$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $\mathcal{L}(Z_n)$ is the
distribution of $Z_n$.

TL;DR: Study of tail asymptotics for absorbed particles in a spectrally negative branching Lévy process under subcritical and critical regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the behavior of particles absorbed at the boundary in a branching Lévy process with strong drift toward -∞.

Method: Analyze the tail asymptotics of the number of absorbed particles during the process's lifetime.

Result: Provides insights into the extinction behavior and particle absorption in subcritical and critical regimes.

Conclusion: The study reveals detailed tail asymptotics, enhancing understanding of particle absorption in such processes.

Abstract: We consider a spectrally negative branching L{\'e}vy process in which
particles are killed upon crossing below zero. It is known that such a process
becomes extinct almost surely if the drift toward -$\infty$ is sufficiently
strong to counterbalance the reproduction rate. In this note, we study the tail
asymptotics of the number of particles absorbed at the boundary during the
lifetime of the process, in both the subcritical and critical regimes.

*Yinon Spinka*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper studies random sets constructed by independently selecting finite subsets of integers with translation-invariant probabilities. It shows conditions under which such sets are finitary factors or isomorphic to IID processes, and relates their stochastic dominance to exponential moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to answer questions posed by Forsström, Gantert, and Steif regarding the properties of random sets, particularly their relationship to IID processes and Bernoulli percolation.

Method: The authors analyze random sets by examining the distribution of selected subsets' sizes and diameters, focusing on the existence of exponential moments.

Result: Key findings include: (1) the random set is a finitary factor of an IID process under sufficient exponential moments, (2) stochastic dominance by Bernoulli percolation requires finite exponential moments, and (3) a partial answer to a phase transition question.

Conclusion: The results generalize to higher dimensions and provide insights into the structure and behavior of such random sets, with implications for their classification and comparison to other processes.

Abstract: Construct a random set by independently selecting each finite subset of the
integers with some probability depending on the set up to translations and
taking the union of the selected sets. We show that when the only sets selected
with positive probability are pairs, such a random set is a finitary factor of
an IID process, answering a question of Forsstr\"om, Gantert and Steif. More
generally, we show that this is the case whenever the distribution induced by
the size of the selected sets has sufficient exponential moments, and that the
existence of some exponential moment is necessary. We further show that such a
random set is stochastically dominated by a non-trivial Bernoulli percolation
if and only if there is a finite exponential moment, thereby partially
answering another question of Forsstr\"om et al. We also give a partial answer
to a third question regarding a form of phase transition. These results also
hold on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d \ge 2$. In the one-dimensional case, under the
condition that the distribution induced by the diameter of the selected sets
has an exponential moment, we further show that such a random set is finitarily
isomorphic to an IID process.

*Kush Kinra,Fernanda Cipriano*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper studies the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of solutions for stochastic third-grade fluid equations on Poincaré domains, proving unique weak solutions and random attractors for bounded and unbounded domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the complex dynamics of incompressible stochastic third-grade fluids, particularly focusing on well-posedness and asymptotic properties in both bounded and unbounded domains.

Method: Proves unique weak solutions under Dirichlet boundary conditions, uses compact Sobolev embeddings for bounded domains, and employs uniform-tail estimates for unbounded domains to establish random attractors.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of unique weak solutions and random attractors for both bounded and unbounded domains, with invariant measures as a consequence.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the challenges posed by nonlinear terms and lack of compact embeddings, providing insights into the asymptotic behavior of stochastic third-grade fluids.

Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade
fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional
Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims
are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of
the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on
$\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under
Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system
$\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using
the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O})
\hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique
random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external
forcing in
$\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$.
Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with
external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a
unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random
attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding
$\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{H}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use
the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic
compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying
system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the
asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis
of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a
consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of
invariant measures for underlying system.

*Eduardo Abi Jaber,Aurélien Alfonsi,Guillaume Szulda*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: New weak existence results for SVEs with continuous coefficients and singular non-convolution kernels are established via an approximation scheme. Stochastic invariance in closed convex sets is emphasized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend weak existence results for SVEs to non-convolution kernels and ensure stochastic invariance in closed convex sets.

Method: Introduce an approximation scheme and prove its convergence. Extend nonnegativity-preserving kernels to non-convolution cases.

Result: Existence of weak solutions for SVEs in closed convex sets, with applications to square-root diffusion coefficients and non-convolution kernels.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generalizes existing results and provides new insights into SVEs with non-convolution kernels, including fractional kernels.

Abstract: We establish new weak existence results for $d$-dimensional Stochastic
Volterra Equations (SVEs) with continuous coefficients and possibly singular
one-dimensional non-convolution kernels. These results are obtained by
introducing an approximation scheme and showing its convergence. A particular
emphasis is made on the stochastic invariance of the solution in a closed
convex set. To do so, we extend the notion of kernels that preserve
nonnegativity introduced in \cite{Alfonsi23} to non-convolution kernels and
show that, under suitable stochastic invariance property of a closed convex set
by the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equation, there exists a weak
solution of the SVE that stays in this convex set. We present a family of
non-convolution kernels that satisfy our assumptions, including a
non-convolution extension of the well-known fractional kernel. We apply our
results to SVEs with square-root diffusion coefficients and non-convolution
kernels, for which we prove the weak existence and uniqueness of a solution
that stays within the nonnegative orthant. We derive a representation of the
Laplace transform in terms of a non-convolution Riccati equation, for which we
establish an existence result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the concept of freeness in free probability theory to real infinitesimal cases and establish its properties.

Method: Introduces real infinitesimal cumulants and analyzes their behavior, proving asymptotic freeness and equivalence to vanishing mixed cumulants.

Result: Independent orthogonally invariant laws are asymptotically real infinitesimally free, and mixed cumulants vanish under this condition.

Conclusion: Real infinitesimal freeness is a valid and analyzable extension of freeness, with clear connections to cumulant behavior.

Abstract: We introduce a new kind of free independence, called real infinitesimal
freeness. We show that independent orthogonally invariant with infinitesimal
laws are asymptotically real infinitesimally free. We introduce new cumulants,
called real infinitesimal cumulants and show that real infinitesimal freeness
is equivalent to vanishing of mixed cumulants. We prove the formula for
cumulants with products as entries.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper studies myopic non-intersecting Brownian motions under a periodic potential, analyzing the balance between potential confinement and repulsion. It shows convergence to a system of non-intersecting random walks in the long-time limit, introducing an algorithm for constrained systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between confinement by a periodic potential and repulsion due to non-intersection constraints in myopic systems.

Method: Analyzes myopic non-intersecting Brownian motions, introduces an algorithm based on modified acceptance-rejection sampling for constrained systems.

Result: Convergence to a system of non-intersecting random walks in the long-time limit, transitioning between standard non-intersection and exclusion behavior.

Conclusion: The interplay between potential and repulsion leads to a transition in dynamics, with the proposed algorithm enabling explicit construction of constrained systems.

Abstract: We introduce a class of Markov processes conditioned to avoid intersection
over a moving time window of length T>0, a setting we refer to as myopic
non-intersection. In particular, we study a system of myopic non-intersecting
Brownian motions subject to a periodic potential. Our focus lies in
understanding the interplay between the confining effect of the potential and
the repulsion induced by the non-intersection constraint. We show that, in the
long time limit, and as both T and the strength of the potential become large,
the model converges to a system of myopic non-intersecting random walks, which
transitions between standard non-intersection dynamics and exclusion behavior.
The main technical contribution of the paper is the introduction of an
algorithm, based on a modification of the acceptance-rejection sampling scheme,
that provides an explicit construction of myopically constrained systems.

Motivation: To improve upon existing bounds (Weil's, Ihara's) for the number of points on curves over finite fields by integrating arithmetic constraints and semi-definite programming.

Method: Combines Serre's arithmetic refinement with Hallouin and Perret's semi-definite programming hierarchy to propose a new bound.

Result: The new bound generically improves Ihara's bound, even in its previously optimal range.

Conclusion: The approach successfully strengthens Ihara's bound and suggests potential extensions to higher-order Weil-Oesterlé bounds.

Abstract: Weil's theorem gives the most standard bound on the number of points of a
curve over a finite field. This bound was improved by Ihara and Oesterl\'e for
larger genus. Recently, Hallouin and Perret gave a new point of view on these
bounds, that can be obtained by solving a sequence of semi-definite programs,
and the two first steps of this hierarchy recover Weil's and Ihara's bounds. On
the other hand, by taking into account arithmetic constraints, Serre obtained a
refinement on Weil's bound. In this article, we combine these two approaches
and propose a strengthening of Ihara's bound, based on an argument similar to
Serre's refinement. We show that this generically improves upon Ihara's bound,
even in the range where it was the best bound so far. Finally we discuss
possible extensions to higher order Weil-Oesterl\'e bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misiurewicz parameters are analogous to singular moduli in dynamical moduli spaces, and understanding their differences as algebraic units could deepen insights into their dynamical properties.

Method: The study builds on earlier work and employs a widely believed irreducibility assumption to analyze the differences of Misiurewicz parameters.

Result: The paper answers the dynamical question in many new cases, showing that such differences can indeed be algebraic units under the given assumption.

Conclusion: The findings extend the understanding of Misiurewicz parameters and their algebraic properties, contributing to the broader study of dynamical systems and moduli spaces.

Abstract: A Misiurewicz parameter is a complex number $c$ for which the orbit of the
critical point $z=0$ under $z^2+c$ is strictly preperiodic. Such parameters
play the same role in dynamical moduli spaces as singular moduli (corresponding
to CM elliptic curves) play on modular curves. Building on our earlier work, we
investigate whether the difference of two Misiurewicz parameters can be an
algebraic unit. (The corresponding question for singular moduli was recently
answered in the negative by Li.) We answer this dynamical question in many new
cases under a widely believed irreducibility assumption.

Motivation: Misiurewicz parameters are analogous to singular moduli in modular curves, and the study aims to extend understanding of their algebraic properties, inspired by recent negative results for singular moduli.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a self-supervised method enabling decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems use separate embedding models for tasks like RAG, complicating the pipeline and causing discrepancies. GEM aims to unify these capabilities within LLMs.

Method: GEM inserts special tokens and manipulates attention masks to generate text embeddings, compatible with post-training or fine-tuning of existing LLMs.

Result: Applied to LLMs (1B-8B parameters), GEM improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM successfully equips LLMs with advanced text embedding abilities while preserving their original NLP performance.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

TL;DR: Increasing the number of speakers in ASR training data improves robustness to unseen accents more than increasing audio duration per speaker, with minimal benefits from accent diversity when speaker count is controlled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR robustness for global use, especially for unseen accents, by analyzing the impact of training data variables like speaker count, audio duration, and accent diversity.

Method: Systematically study the effects of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity on ASR performance in low-resource settings.

Result: More speakers (with less audio per speaker) improves ASR robustness; scaling training hours is more effective with more speakers. Accent diversity offers minimal benefits when speaker count is fixed.

Conclusion: Practitioners should prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training data for better performance on unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations, revealing linear encoding of semantic and syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings lack interpretability due to complex neural transformations and pooling operations, making their internal structure unclear.

Method: Proposes dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose embeddings and analyze pooling's role in feature compression.

Result: Finds semantic and syntactic features are linearly encoded in embeddings, enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Bridges token-level interpretability with sentence-level analysis, improving transparency and control over embeddings.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines label hierarchy and text encoding using contrastive learning, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy and text encoding separately or guide hierarchy in text encoders, missing complementary benefits.

Method: HTC-CLIP learns hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations via contrastive learning, pooling both during inference.

Result: Achieves 0.99-2.37% Macro F1 improvement on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Combining complementary approaches in one architecture enhances HTC performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [133] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, finding poor performance, especially on generative tasks. Fine-tuned smaller models outperform, with pre-training and instruction-tuning in Maltese being key. Fine-tuning is costly but more effective than prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM performance on low-resource languages like Maltese and identify factors affecting effectiveness.

Method: Evaluated 55 LLMs using a new benchmark with 11 tasks, analyzing performance factors like pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: Many LLMs perform poorly, especially on generative tasks. Fine-tuned smaller models excel, with prior Maltese exposure being crucial. Fine-tuning outperforms prompting.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive language tech and suggests traditional approaches for low-resource languages, emphasizing fine-tuning and pre-training in the target language.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model for few-shot intent detection in customer care, improving accuracy by 20-23% over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care requires domain-specific intent classifiers, but cross-domain data scarcity limits model performance. A solution for generalization with minimal annotations is needed.

Method: Uses supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers for domain-specific embedders and multilingual knowledge distillation for cross-domain generalization.

Result: Achieves 20-23% higher accuracy in few-shot intent detection on e-commerce datasets (Canada, Mexico).

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes across domains with few annotations, enhancing customer care automation.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models generalize form but not meaning of rare constructions like LET-ALONE, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if language models generalize both form and meaning of rare constructions, as humans do.

Method: Tested human-scale transformer models on a synthetic benchmark for the rare LET-ALONE construction, evaluating syntactic and semantic properties.

Result: Models generalized form well but failed to generalize meaning, showing an asymmetry in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Current architectures lack human-like generalization for meaning, highlighting a gap in AI language learning.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction without predefined schemas or annotations, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated data, leading to incomplete results. ZOES aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, leveraging mutual reinforcement between entities and their structures.

Result: ZOES improves LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures across three domains, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism in ZOES offers a principled approach to enhance LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking techniques (Gumbel and KGW) affect LLM alignment (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness), revealing degradation patterns. It proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to mitigate these effects and restore alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of watermarking on LLM alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness) and address the degradation caused by watermarking techniques.

Method: Systematic analysis of two watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) on four aligned LLMs, followed by proposing Alignment Resampling (AR) to restore alignment using an external reward model.

Result: Watermarking causes two degradation patterns (guard attenuation and amplification). AR recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores with 2-4 samples, maintaining detectability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the balance between watermark strength and alignment, offering AR as a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to improve LLM alignment, achieving a 9.37% performance boost over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods rely on costly curated data, limiting scalability. PUGC aims to utilize abundant, implicit preferences in UGC for scalable alignment.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and generates responses, using UGC as reference text for scoring to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: Models trained with PUGC and DPO show a 9.37% improvement, achieving a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate on Alpaca Eval 2.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a scalable, effective solution for LLM alignment, improving reward quality, domain-specific alignment, and robustness.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights. SQLens addresses this by detecting and correcting such errors.

Method: SQLens integrates error signals from databases and LLMs to identify and correct semantic errors in SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens outperforms LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and boosts execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by addressing semantic errors.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for better performance in ambiguous tasks, and DRE refines their collaboration for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can enhance reliability in tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: Introduces SLIDE for adaptive weighting of SLMs and LLMs, and DRE for refining evaluations via SLM-guided adjustments.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, aligning better with human judgment in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs improves reliability in open-ended tasks, showcasing the potential of hybrid models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of explicit decomposition in LLM-based translation, finding no clear evidence for its benefits and showing that simple 'translate again' prompts outperform step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, particularly whether explicit decomposition improves performance.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting (e.g., decomposition and refinement) with simpler prompts like 'translate again' on LLMs.

Result: No clear evidence that decomposition improves translation; 'translate again' prompts yielded better results than step-by-step methods.

Conclusion: The study does not dismiss reasoning's role but calls for further exploration of CoT's effectiveness in translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can broadly categorize but struggle with nuanced senses of the discourse particle 'just'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained semantic/discourse effects of polyfunctional words like 'just'.

Method: Using expert-labeled data to evaluate LLMs' performance on differentiating senses of 'just'.

Result: LLMs show limited success in capturing subtle nuances despite some ability in broader categorization.

Conclusion: LLMs lack full understanding of discourse particles' nuanced effects.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale dataset for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in under-resourced African languages, along with improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE). These outperform existing methods and compete with advanced LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for low-resource African languages, prompting the need for better datasets and tools.

Method: The authors create SSA-MTE, a human-annotated dataset for 13 African language pairs, and develop improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE). They also benchmark LLM-based approaches.

Result: SSA-COMET models outperform AfriCOMET and rival top LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The work provides open resources to advance MT evaluation for African languages, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [147] [Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04572)
*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can manipulate prompts to bias operations, bypassing LLM-based monitors like GPT-4o-mini. Four attack types are identified, highlighting the need for stronger security protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents exploit prompt manipulation to bias system behavior and evade detection, revealing gaps in current security measures.

Method: Examines four types of integrity attacks (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to manipulate MAS behavior and evaluation systems.

Result: Demonstrates that malicious agents can systematically bias MAS operations and bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, exposing limitations in current detection mechanisms.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the urgent need for MAS architectures with robust security, content validation, and monitoring systems to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [148] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Reasoning-based methods didn't improve performance; GPT-4o without Chain-of-Thought prompting performed best, aligning with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs, including reasoning and non-reasoning models, perform in financial sentiment analysis and whether reasoning improves accuracy.

Method: Compared proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms (System 1 vs. System 2) and benchmarked against fine-tuned models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone).

Result: Reasoning did not improve performance; GPT-4o without CoT prompting was most accurate. Linguistic complexity and annotation agreement impacted performance, with reasoning sometimes causing overthinking.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment analysis, fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) aligns better with human judgment than deliberative reasoning (System 2), challenging the assumption that more reasoning improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [149] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the unreliability of LLMs as logic translators due to struggles with lexical diversification and introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating this issue, and MenTaL, a method to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks, and existing benchmarks lack diversity, masking this limitation.

Method: Proposes SCALe, a benchmark for lexical diversification, and MenTaL, a method to unify diverse expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments confirm LLMs' deficiencies in handling lexical diversity, and MenTaL significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical gap in LLM-based logical reasoning and offers a practical solution to enhance reliability.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [150] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A gradient matching method for selecting demonstrations in many-shot ICL outperforms random selection, improving performance on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on random selection for many-shot demonstrations in ICL is a critical challenge, and the hypothesis is that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar.

Method: A gradient matching approach aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples to mimic the learning effect of the full dataset.

Result: The method consistently outperforms random selection, achieving up to 4% improvement on large LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B.

Conclusion: Gradient matching enables more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, broadening its applicability.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

### [151] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SUCEA is a training-free framework for adversarial claim fact-checking, improving retrieval and entailment accuracy by decomposing claims into sub-claims, iteratively editing them, and aggregating evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adversarial claims in fact-checking, which are designed to mislead systems.

Method: Modular framework with three steps: claim segmentation, iterative evidence retrieval and editing, and evidence aggregation.

Result: Outperforms baselines on retrieval and entailment accuracy in two datasets.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively handles adversarial claims, enhancing fact-checking robustness.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting poor performance of current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for verifying scientific claims using multimodal data from figures, which is crucial for assessing scientific claims.

Method: Automated extraction of supported claims from articles, manual perturbation to create contradicted claims, and diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Current vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model reaching only 0.77 F1, showing biases and struggles with evidence localization and multimodal aggregation.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant gaps in models' ability to verify claims, emphasizing the need for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

TL;DR: LESS is a framework using LLMs to refine pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning, improving ASR and AST tasks with notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality of pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning by leveraging LLMs for correction and optimization.

Method: Uses LLMs to refine pseudo labels from ASR/AST data, combined with a data filtering strategy for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction on Mandarin ASR and high BLEU scores (34.0, 64.7) on Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS is adaptable across languages and tasks, with ablation studies offering insights into LLM use for speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by providing step-aware proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like PRMs or self-consistency lack transparency and verifiable evidence for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective framework that formalizes reasoning steps in Lean 4 and provides proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across models and datasets, with interpretable evidence. Introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark for step correctness.

Conclusion: The work pioneers the use of Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with formal languages' original purpose of ensuring robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISMATCHED, a new benchmark for Scientific NLI focusing on non-CS domains (PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, PUBLIC HEALTH), with 2,700 annotated pairs. Baselines using SLMs and LLMs achieve 78.17% Macro F1, showing room for improvement. Training with implicit NLI relations boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets are limited to CS domains, ignoring non-CS fields. The paper aims to address this gap by creating a diverse benchmark.

Method: Developed MISMATCHED, a dataset with 2,700 annotated sentence pairs from non-CS domains. Evaluated using SLMs and LLMs, and explored training with implicit NLI relations.

Result: Best baseline achieved 78.17% Macro F1, indicating significant potential for improvement. Training with implicit relations enhanced model performance.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED fills a gap in NLI benchmarks for non-CS domains. Future work can leverage the dataset for further advancements in scientific NLI.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances LLM reasoning by adding compute during inference. ADAPT, a lightweight diversity-aware method, outperforms baselines with 80% accuracy using less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-optimized LLMs often lack output diversity, limiting TTS effectiveness.

Method: Proposed ADAPT: diversity-aware prefix fine-tuning with a focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on math tasks with 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper explores how innovators' subjective perspectives and interpersonal opportunities, modeled using machine learning, predict creative success. It finds that perspective diversity enhances innovation, while background diversity may hinder it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personal perspectives and social structures influence innovation capacity, leveraging machine learning to model innovators' trajectories.

Method: Uses dynamic language representations to quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities, analyzing data from scientists, inventors, writers, and others across creative domains.

Result: Perspective diversity predicts creative achievement, whereas background diversity often hinders it. Simulations with AI agents confirm these findings.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators use common language to integrate diverse experiences, highlighting implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: Proposes static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantics via PCA and learning methods, outperforming existing models and rivaling SimCSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sentence semantic representation using computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extracts embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, improves them with PCA, and applies knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. Sentence representation is done by averaging word embeddings.

Result: Outperforms existing static models on semantic tasks and rivals SimCSE in some datasets. Analyses confirm removal of irrelevant components and norm adjustments based on word influence.

Conclusion: The method effectively optimizes static embeddings for sentence semantics, offering a lightweight yet competitive alternative to dynamic models.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR enhances LLMs' tool use via high-quality dataset creation (ToolBench-V) and dynamic reflection learning (ToolBench-R), outperforming benchmarks like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliable tool planning and weak reflection in LLMs due to poor datasets and static learning.

Method: Introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) for dataset quality and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for dynamic error correction.

Result: Tool-MVR surpasses ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, reducing API calls by 31.4%. Achieves 58.9% error correction on RefineToolBench.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR significantly improves tool use and reflection in LLMs, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: A practical method to generate AVSR datasets from raw video is presented, enabling strong baseline performance for Vietnamese, especially in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR's robustness against noise is hindered by dataset scarcity, especially for non-English languages. Automated data collection can address this.

Method: Refines existing techniques to generate AVSR datasets from raw video efficiently.

Result: The automatically collected dataset supports a competitive baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, excelling in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: This method efficiently expands AVSR to under-resourced languages, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free KV cache compression method that adapts quantization precision to error sensitivity and eliminates outlier handling, reducing memory footprint to 27% of the baseline while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demands of KV cache in transformer models scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models. Existing quantization methods struggle with sparse outliers.

Method: TaDA uses adaptive quantization precision based on error sensitivity and mean centering to avoid separate outlier handling.

Result: Experiments show TaDA reduces KV cache memory to 27% of the 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable, high-performance reasoning in language models by supporting longer contexts and chains of thought without outlier management.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and

### [162] [Flex-TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Flexible Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04649)
*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' dynamic planning abilities, introducing sequential constraints and prioritized competing constraints. It reveals gaps in models' adaptability and prioritization skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs' planning focus on static scenarios, lacking evaluation of dynamic, multi-turn planning. Flex-TravelPlanner addresses this gap.

Method: Extends the TravelPlanner dataset with two new settings: sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints. Evaluates GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B.

Result: Models perform poorly in multi-turn adaptation, are sensitive to constraint order, and struggle with prioritization, favoring new lower-priority constraints.

Conclusion: Dynamic planning benchmarks are crucial for realistic evaluation. The findings guide improvements for LLMs in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [163] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inadequacy of current alignment strategies for LLMs, showing they fail to prevent misuse due to shallow behavioral reinforcement rather than genuine normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing concerns about AI safety, the paper explores why current LLM alignment methods are insufficient to prevent adversarial exploitation.

Method: The study critiques existing alignment strategies, comparing them to human deliberative reasoning from moral psychology, and evaluates LLMs' vulnerability to normative conflicts.

Result: Current alignment methods reinforce shallow behaviors, leaving LLMs vulnerable to adversarial attacks, unlike humans who use deliberative reasoning to resolve conflicts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that "shallow alignment" is a critical flaw, urging the need for deeper normative reasoning in LLMs to ensure safer AI deployment.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

*Gio Paik,Geewook Kim,Jinbae Im*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMRefine is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in error refinement across six scenarios and error types, identifying bottlenecks and improvement areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance MLLMs' reasoning during inference by evaluating their error detection and correction capabilities.

Method: MMRefine evaluates MLLMs across six scenarios and categorizes errors into six types, testing refinement performance.

Result: Experiments reveal bottlenecks in refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in reasoning enhancement.

Conclusion: MMRefine provides a valuable framework for advancing MLLMs' reasoning and refinement capabilities, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance when mixed with high-quality data, outperforming other synthetic data methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by recycling discarded low-quality web data to supplement limited high-quality text availability.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to transform and enrich low-quality documents for training, mixing them with high-quality raw texts.

Result: Improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks, outperforming 2x web data and other synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple, effective approach to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

### [166] [Cracking the Code: Enhancing Implicit Hate Speech Detection through Coding Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04693)
*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) using six codetypes and validates their effectiveness in improving detection across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of hate speech online, especially subtle forms like im-HS, poses societal and individual threats, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: 1) prompting LLMs to classify im-HS based on responses, and 2) embedding codetypes into LLMs during encoding.

Result: Experiments show codetypes enhance im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and methods effectively improve im-HS detection, demonstrating cross-language applicability.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

*Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model reasoning by leveraging redundant reasoning patterns, reducing latency by 60-65% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques for language models are computationally expensive, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: STAND uses stochastic adaptive N-gram drafting, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently without draft models.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14-28% in throughput while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning without additional training, applicable to any existing model.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation for the SeamlessM4T model in low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi speech translation, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-resource speech translation for Bhojpuri-Hindi by optimizing hyperparameters and augmenting data.

Method: Systematic investigation of hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) and data augmentation techniques (speed perturbation, SpecAugment). Cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data was also examined.

Result: Careful hyperparameter selection and simple augmentation techniques significantly improved translation quality in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Effective hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation enhance performance in low-resource speech translation, with insights into error types impacting BLEU scores.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm where multiple LLMs compete and evaluate each other to improve diversity and reduce biases, outperforming baselines in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of diversity and biases in single-model generation and evaluation by leveraging collective competition.

Method: Multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe,' competing and judging each other's responses, with scores aggregated via an adapted Elo-ranking system. Preference pairs from duels are used for iterative learning.

Result: Outperforms initial models and 4 baselines in 10/12 tasks, with a 7.0% average improvement, and generalizes better to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables self-evolution of LLMs through collective competition, producing more logical and informative outputs.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes C$^2$EFND, a framework combining LLMs and SLMs for fake news detection, addressing limitations like outdated knowledge and data scarcity. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts. Current methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with training demands, adaptability, and outdated knowledge.

Method: C$^2$EFND uses multi-round collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing for LLMs and replay-based learning for SLMs.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show C$^2$EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging LLMs and SLMs collaboratively, improving performance in dynamic news environments.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional metrics for evaluating text revisions in scientific writing and proposes a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore focus on similarity rather than meaningful improvements, necessitating better evaluation methods.

Method: The study includes manual annotation of revision quality, exploration of reference-free metrics, and analysis of LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: LLMs excel at assessing instruction-following but lack correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and task-specific metrics provides the most reliable evaluation of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper probes LLMs' internal political states using a multi-dimensional framework and interpretable representation engineering to address misalignment and concept confounds in their responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and reliance on single-axis concepts leading to confounds, motivate the need for probing internal mechanisms and multi-dimensional analysis.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset are designed for fine-grained concept vector learning, applied with three representation engineering techniques on eight LLMs.

Result: The vectors disentangle political concept confounds, validate semantic meaning in detection tasks, and enable intervention to generate politically varied responses.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional representation engineering effectively uncovers and intervenes in LLMs' political states, improving transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) on fine-grained perception and reasoning in spoken language, covering 47 tasks and 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets. It highlights gaps in current models and provides a standard for future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechLLMs lack exploration in fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech. MMSU addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: MMSU includes 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, incorporating diverse linguistic phenomena (phonetics, prosody, semantics, etc.). It evaluates 14 advanced SpeechLLMs.

Result: The evaluation reveals significant room for improvement in current SpeechLLMs, identifying key areas for future optimization.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding, offering insights for advancing human-AI speech interaction systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: A survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) analyzing integration methods, representation learning, and training paradigms, proposing a classification framework based on 125 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how different modalities connect to language backbones in MLLMs, addressing a gap in existing literature.

Method: LLM-centric analysis of current approaches, examining transformation and alignment of modal inputs into language embedding space. Proposes a classification framework based on architectural strategies, representation learning, and training paradigms.

Result: Identifies emerging patterns in MLLMs (2021-2025) and provides a structured taxonomy of integration techniques.

Conclusion: The taxonomy guides future development of robust multimodal integration strategies for pre-trained models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic is a framework for evaluating LLM logical reasoning across accuracy, stepwise soundness, and alignment. It also studies supervision formats, finding natural language aids generalization while symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus only on final-answer accuracy, missing reasoning quality and structure. FineLogic aims to provide a more rigorous evaluation.

Method: Proposes FineLogic for fine-grained evaluation and studies four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes better, while symbolic styles improve structural reasoning. Fine-tuning enhances step-by-step generation, not shortcuts.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a more interpretable evaluation of LLM reasoning, with insights on supervision formats for improving logical capabilities.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-BERT approach for machine translation proofreading achieves high accuracy and outperforms recent methods by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine translation quality by reducing errors requiring human post-editing.

Method: Combines CNN for local n-gram patterns and BERT for context-rich representations, with integrated error detection and correction modules.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, outperforming recent techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach sets a new benchmark for identifying and correcting mistranslations and omissions.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Result: VLMs struggled with handwriting recognition, causing errors in LLM grading, but LLM feedback remained somewhat useful despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show potential for educational assessment, handwriting recognition and feedback personalization remain key challenges.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

### [178] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks with daily new test sets, requiring a system to solve them without relying on crossing words.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable wordplay reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a successful LLM-based approach to solving cryptic clues, offering transparency and high performance.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [179] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models by analyzing reasoning traces and answer consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to detect hallucinations in reasoning traces of LRMs, which are critical for transparency and performance.

Method: RACE evaluates reasoning traces using four signals: inter-sample consistency, entropy-based uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection methods across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs by detecting fine-grained hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a dataset for simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a web-based tool for annotation and alignment, addressing gaps in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel corpora and alignment tools fail to model long-range interactions and specific divergences in simultaneous interpreting, necessitating dedicated datasets and tools.

Method: The authors collected a dataset (MockConf) from student mock conferences, transcribed and aligned it, and developed InterAlign, a web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span alignment.

Result: The dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 languages, and the tool supports evaluation metrics and baseline automatic alignment.

Conclusion: The released dataset and tools aim to support research in automatic simultaneous interpreting by providing annotated resources and alignment capabilities.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 for generating MCQs in education, finding GPT-3.5 most effective, while noting educator reluctance toward AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of manually creating MCQs by leveraging LLMs, ensuring educator control over source text.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) for MCQ generation, injecting knowledge into prompts to avoid hallucinations.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperformed others in generating effective MCQs, though educators showed reluctance to adopt AI.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-3.5, hold promise for MCQ generation, but further work is needed to address adoption barriers.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [182] [Prompting LLMs: Length Control for Isometric Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855)
*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompt strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection. Key findings include the importance of instruction phrasing, limited impact of extreme examples on length control, and marginal gains in translation quality with more few-shot examples. Multiple outputs improve the length-quality tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection affect translation quality and length control in isometric machine translation.

Method: Used eight open-source LLMs of varying sizes, tested different prompting strategies, few-shot examples (5, 10, 20), and demonstration selection across En→De, En→Fr, and En→Es language pairs.

Result: Instruction phrasing aligned with demonstrations is crucial for length control. LLMs produce shorter translations only with extreme examples. Few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples. Multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff, achieving state-of-the-art performance for some pairs.

Conclusion: Effective isometric translation requires careful instruction phrasing and demonstration alignment. Few-shot examples beyond 5 offer diminishing returns, and multiple outputs optimize the length-quality balance.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

*Wenxi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models for cross-lingual tasks, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess UD's effectiveness in improving pretrained language models for cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification.

Method: Integration of UD into pretrained language models and evaluation on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration improves accuracy and F1 scores by 3.85% and 6.08% on average, reducing performance gaps with large language models.

Conclusion: UD is valid and promising for out-of-domain tasks, with performance linked to UD-based similarity scores.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real competition scenarios, featuring curated ICPC problems, robust evaluation tools, and a new metric, Refine@K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to adequately assess LLMs' coding and reflective reasoning abilities in competitive environments.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC contest problems, a test case generation method, a local evaluation toolkit, and the Refine@K metric for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top-tier LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback for optimal performance but still trail top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval highlights the challenges in evaluating complex reasoning and underscores the gap between LLMs and human performance in competitive coding.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested narrative reasoning by transforming ListOps computations into lengthy stories, revealing their struggle with state management and intermediate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test nested narrative reasoning in LLMs, masking their limitations in state management and intermediate reasoning.

Method: Verbose ListOps programmatically converts ListOps computations into coherent stories, controlling narrative size and reasoning difficulty to isolate LLM vulnerabilities.

Result: Leading LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths, despite solving raw ListOps easily, highlighting their difficulty with nested reasoning.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps identifies a critical LLM weakness in state management, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context-window expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that fine-tuning multilingual end-to-end models is the best approach for low-resource ASR, proposing a hybrid HMM and self-supervised method that outperforms fine-tuning by 32% WER reduction on Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fine-tuning multilingual models for low-resource languages, especially when the language wasn't in the original training data.

Method: Combines hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, leveraging continued pre-training and semi-supervised training to utilize all available speech and text data.

Result: Achieves a 32% relative WER reduction over fine-tuned Whisper models on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is more effective than fine-tuning for low-resource ASR, offering better performance with limited data.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can provide multilingual instructional feedback, improving learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when aligned with the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' ability to offer effective instructional support across diverse languages, particularly for math reasoning tasks.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs across 11 languages, 4 models, and multiple prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual hints improve learning, especially in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's language.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance multilingual educational tools, making them more effective and inclusive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset with images and metadata, and shows that adding contextual information (visual or textual) improves NMT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce with unclear sentences or poor data quality.

Method: Created ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs with images/metadata) and tested context-aware methods, including a vision-language model and text-to-text models with added contextual info.

Result: Visual context and additional textual information (e.g., product category path) improved translation quality.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information enhances NMT performance, and the ConECT dataset is made publicly available.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning pipeline improves ASR fine-tuning by leveraging auxiliary data and iterative pseudo-label refinement, outperforming single-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning ASR models for specific domains is difficult with scarce labeled data, but unlabeled audio and related-domain labeled data are often available.

Method: An incremental pipeline integrates small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary data, then refines pseudo-labels using multi-model consensus or NER filtering.

Result: Achieves 4% improvement with auxiliary data, and up to 24.8% relative improvement over single-step fine-tuning with random selection.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering is most effective, while NER offers competitive performance at lower cost.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOP evaluates LLMs' comprehension skills from a cognitive perspective, revealing gaps in expert-level alignment and reliability, suggesting process-focused improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs' comprehension aligns with experts and identify gaps in their cognitive processes.

Method: Proposes SCOP: defines five comprehension skills, constructs testing data, and analyzes LLMs' performance.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, show biases (e.g., local over global), and may produce correct answers via flawed processes.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on thorough development of comprehension skills during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple method for controlling text length in summarization by adjusting EOS token prediction importance in loss computation, compatible with various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length in summarization are complex and incompatible with pre-trained models.

Method: Increase the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss to control length without altering model architecture.

Result: Effective length control in encoder-decoder and GPT-style models, often without compromising summary quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with other inference-time techniques.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

*Yutao Hou,Zeguan Xiao,Fei Yu,Yihan Jiang,Xuetao Wei,Hailiang Huang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework for testing LLM robustness by generating semantically equivalent but challenging math problem variants, reducing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail unexpectedly in simple reasoning tasks, and existing robustness evaluations rely on limited or potentially contaminated datasets.

Method: AR-Checker uses multi-round parallel LLM-based rewriting and verification to dynamically generate problem variants.

Result: AR-Checker performs well on GSM8K, MATH-500, and other benchmarks like MMLU and CommonsenseQA.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively tests LLM robustness across diverse tasks, minimizing data contamination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

*Moshe Ofer,Orel Zamler,Amos Azaria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALL enhances LLM performance for low-resource languages by integrating bilingual translation models and lightweight adapters, showing significant improvements in Hebrew.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages due to limited training data, necessitating a solution to leverage their capabilities effectively.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment layers and custom transformers to transform low-resource inputs into high-resource representations. It employs parameter-efficient training with frozen pre-trained components and lightweight adapters.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL effectively bridges the gap for low-resource languages, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

*Noy Sternlicht,Ariel Gera,Roy Bar-Haim,Tom Hope,Noam Slonim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLM judges, analyzing their performance against human judges and their ability to generate persuasive speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' cognitive abilities in evaluating debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, style, and tone, which has been understudied in LLM benchmarking.

Method: Utilized a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches to compare state-of-the-art LLMs with human judges and evaluated LLMs' ability to generate persuasive speeches.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at a human level.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced capabilities and limitations of LLMs in debate speech evaluation and generation, suggesting areas for further research.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [197] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, analyzing two examples—one invalid and one minimal but valid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs' self-reports relate to the concept of introspection, given their linguistic and cognitive abilities.

Method: Critique of two LLM self-report examples: one on creative writing (invalid) and one on inferring its temperature parameter (minimal introspection).

Result: The first example is not introspection; the second is a minimal form, likely without consciousness.

Conclusion: Introspection can be minimally applied to LLMs, but lacks conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [198] [RIVAL: Reinforcement Learning with Iterative and Adversarial Optimization for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05070)
*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIVAL, an adversarial training framework, improves LLM performance in colloquial subtitle translation by addressing distributional shift between the reward model and LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor performance of RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation due to distributional shift between the offline reward model and online LLM.

Method: Proposes RIVAL, a min-max adversarial training framework where the RM distinguishes strong/weak translations and the LLM improves to close the gap, incorporating qualitative and quantitative rewards.

Result: RIVAL significantly outperforms baseline methods in translation tasks.

Conclusion: Adversarial training (RIVAL) effectively mitigates distributional shift and enhances translation quality in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

### [199] [Just a Scratch: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Self-harm Detection through Intent Differentiation and Emoji Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05073)
*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES dataset to improve LLMs' ability to detect self-harm intent on social media by analyzing nuanced language-emoji interplay, achieving better performance in detection and explanation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm on social media is crucial for suicide prevention, but current LLMs struggle with implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: The framework enriches inputs with CESM-100, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and intent span detection), and generates explainable rationales.

Result: The approach enhances LLM performance in self-harm detection and intent differentiation, addressing ambiguity in signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset and CESM-100 provide valuable tools for improving self-harm detection, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

### [200] [Parking, Perception, and Retail: Street-Level Determinants of Community Vitality in Harbin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05080)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses AI to analyze how street features like parking, greenery, and cleanliness affect retail performance and satisfaction in Harbin, China, finding that vehicle presence and spatial configuration are key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how street-level features impact commercial vitality and user satisfaction in urban communities.

Method: Uses street view imagery and AI (VisualGLM-6B, GPT-4) to create a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyze spatial attributes.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence aids commerce, but excessive parking harms walkability. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but not pricing. Street width moderates vehicle effects.

Conclusion: AI-assisted perception and urban analysis reveal non-linear drivers of commercial success, offering insights for urban design and parking management.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media can cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: The framework uses contrastive learning to enhance semantic difference learning and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: CL-ISR improves detection accuracy by effectively capturing distinguishing features and implicit information.

Conclusion: The proposed CL-ISR framework significantly enhances misleading text detection by integrating contrastive learning and stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system integrating W2V and Phi-4 MLLM for spoken language assessment, addressing modality-specific limitations of BERT and W2V, achieving competitive RMSE scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural models (BERT and W2V) for SLA have modality-specific limitations—BERT lacks prosodic/phonetic cues, while W2V lacks semantic interpretability.

Method: A score fusion strategy integrates W2V and Phi-4 MLLM to leverage both acoustic and semantic features.

Result: The system achieves an RMSE of 0.375, ranking second in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The fusion of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM effectively addresses individual model limitations, improving SLA performance.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

### [203] [DiCoRe: Enhancing Zero-shot Event Detection via Divergent-Convergent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05128)
*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a framework for zero-shot event detection (ED) using divergent-convergent reasoning with Dreamer and Grounder, outperforming baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot ED is challenging for LLMs due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers. DiCoRe aims to improve coverage and precision.

Method: DiCoRe uses Dreamer for open-ended event discovery (divergent reasoning) and Grounder for task-aligned predictions (convergent reasoning), with LLM-Judge for verification.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms baselines on six datasets across five domains, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot ED framework, enhancing event coverage and precision.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Taiga Someya,Anej Svete,Brian DuSell,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing higher entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, aligning with human-like sensitivity to local structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if neural LMs' inductive biases align with human processing constraints by quantifying biases through $m$-local entropy.

Method: Introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, and tests it on perturbed natural language corpora and PFSA-defined languages using Transformer and LSTM LMs.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure.

Conclusion: Neural LMs exhibit human-like sensitivity to local language structure, suggesting alignment in inductive biases.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large audio-language models (LALMs) process auditory attributes, revealing that earlier layer resolution improves accuracy and models rely on querying inputs. It proposes a method to enhance LALMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes for better interpretation and performance.

Method: Vocabulary projection applied to three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information decreases with layer depth when recognition fails; earlier layer resolution correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely on querying inputs rather than aggregating information in hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and suggest a method to enhance LALMs, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as evaluators show discrepancies with human judgments on error severity in image descriptions, with only DeepSeek-V3 aligning closely with human assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation, particularly in image descriptions.

Method: Systematic comparison of human and LLM assessments in unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings, evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.

Result: Humans vary severity by error type, with visual context amplifying severity for colour and type errors. Most LLMs misjudge severity, except DeepSeek-V3, which aligns best with human judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms (e.g., gender) but lack perceptual grounding (e.g., colour). DeepSeek-V3 outperforms even multimodal models, suggesting unimodal models can achieve high alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and neglecting the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1 with joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge utilization, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized bias-related components and their impact on other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by examining their internal structures and the stability of bias-related components.

Method: Uses mechanistic interpretability to identify bias-related edges, assesses their stability and localization, and performs systematic ablations to study their impact.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in specific layers, change across fine-tuning settings, and their removal affects both bias reduction and other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is structurally localized but intertwined with other tasks, suggesting careful intervention is needed to mitigate biases without harming model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: Existing compression methods in RAG overlook filtering non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

Method: Proposes ECoRAG, which compresses documents based on evidentiality and retrieves more if evidence is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing methods in ODQA tasks, reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG is a cost-efficient, high-performance framework for LLM-based RAG in ODQA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series improves text embedding and reranking using Qwen3 LLMs, with multi-stage training and model merging for robustness. It offers various model sizes and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text embedding and reranking capabilities by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs' multilingual understanding and generation, addressing diverse deployment needs.

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, with model merging for robustness. Qwen3 LLMs synthesize diverse training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MTEB and excels in retrieval tasks (code, cross-lingual, multilingual).

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is a robust, adaptable solution for embedding and reranking, publicly available under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, demonstrating their ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios using a synthetic linear regression task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: A synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzing the role of self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity in Transformers.

Result: Language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in this setup, with performance driven by self-attention, depth, and data diversity. The findings extend to sequential data, hinting at potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Transformers are capable of counterfactual reasoning, and the study provides insights into the mechanisms enabling this ability, with broader implications for tasks like story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition, revealing their limitations with complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, focusing on language recognition tasks.

Method: Introduces the RELIC framework, which uses synthetic languages to evaluate LLMs' performance on grammar-based tasks of varying complexity.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show near-chance performance on complex grammars, relying on shallow heuristics as task difficulty increases.

Conclusion: RELIC highlights LLMs' current limitations in handling complex instruction-following tasks and provides insights into their reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM pretraining, addressing ethical concerns of unlicensed data. Two 7B-parameter models trained on it perform competitively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate intellectual property and ethical issues in LLM training by using openly licensed text, overcoming limitations of prior small or low-quality datasets.

Method: Collected and curated the Common Pile v0.1 from 30 diverse sources, then trained two 7B-parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and v0.1-2T) on 1T and 2T tokens respectively.

Result: Both models achieved competitive performance compared to unlicensed-data-trained LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 and associated models demonstrate that openly licensed data can effectively train performant LLMs, addressing ethical concerns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised tasks like autoencoding and CMLM improve morphological inflection in low-resource languages, with performance varying by data availability and mask sampling based on morpheme boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore self-supervised auxiliary tasks for character-level morphological inflection in low-resource languages, addressing the scarcity of labeled data.

Method: Train encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages using 13 auxiliary objectives, comparing autoencoding and CMLM under varying data conditions.

Result: Autoencoding excels with very limited data, while CMLM performs better as data increases. Mask sampling based on morpheme boundaries consistently improves results.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks are effective for low-resource morphological modeling, with CMLM and strategic mask sampling offering promising directions.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified system for representing syntactic continuity and discontinuity in natural languages by integrating Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified approach for analyzing discontinuous structures in linguistic theory, which are currently treated as independent systems.

Method: Combines PSG (constituency), DG (head-dependent relations), and CG (functor-argument relations) into a single mathematical derivation framework.

Result: Demonstrates that both continuous and discontinuous structures can be analyzed through this unified system.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a convergent and comprehensive method for syntactic analysis across different linguistic formalisms.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning process for LLMs to improve hallucination detection by decomposing text into smaller facts and verifying each against source evidence, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI-based hallucination detection methods lack fine-grained reasoning, which could be improved by systematic decomposition and evidence verification.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution/entailment classification, and aggregated classification, with metrics to evaluate intermediate steps.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection accuracy and provides empirical evidence of better reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Systematic reasoning enhances LLM performance in hallucination detection, supported by intermediate step metrics.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by hierarchically decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address knowledge conflicts in RAG systems where retrieved and parametric knowledge contradict, harming QA performance.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space to decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better reasoning.

Result: Significant QA accuracy improvements across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially temporal and semantic. Robust on non-conflict questions.

Conclusion: Micro-Act effectively mitigates knowledge conflicts in RAG systems, enhancing QA performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProRefine is a prompt optimization method for AI agent workflows, improving accuracy and scalability by refining prompts dynamically using LLM feedback, outperforming baselines by 3-37% on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows often underperform due to poor prompts, limiting reliability and scalability. ProRefine aims to address this by optimizing prompts without additional training.

Method: ProRefine dynamically refines prompts using textual feedback from LLMs, eliminating the need for ground truth labels or extra training.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37% on five math reasoning datasets, enabling smaller models to match larger ones.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances AI workflow performance and scalability, democratizing access to high-performing AI by optimizing prompts efficiently.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, using a novel logit-margin flattening loss and a scalable primal-dual algorithm, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to unlearn sensitive or outdated data, but current methods suffer from unstable optimization and degraded performance.

Method: Formulates unlearning as constrained optimization with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved via a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted data while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable and efficient solution for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: Search Arena introduces a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing user preferences and credibility gaps in citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diverse, large-scale datasets for analyzing search-augmented LLMs and understand user preferences in multi-turn interactions.

Method: Crowd-sourced dataset of 24,000 multi-turn interactions with human preference votes, cross-arena analyses comparing search-augmented and conventional LLMs.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation quantity and source type, with community-driven platforms favored. Search-augmented LLMs perform well in non-search settings.

Conclusion: The dataset highlights gaps in perceived vs. actual credibility and the need for diverse citation sources, supporting future research in search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models show biases in preference judgments due to training data artifacts, favoring superficial features over substance. A post-training method using counterfactual data augmentation reduces miscalibration and skew.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic miscalibration in language models, which prioritize superficial patterns over substantive qualities, leading to unreliable evaluations.

Method: Systematically investigate training data biases and propose counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to mitigate miscalibration.

Result: CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA effectively improves the reliability of preference models.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: HSSBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks, addressing gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting the interdisciplinary and abstract reasoning needs of HSS.

Method: HSSBench includes over 13,000 samples in six categories, generated via a collaborative pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents.

Result: Benchmarking 20+ MLLMs shows significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a self-supervised method enabling decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original text generation and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems use separate embedding models for tasks like RAG, complicating the system and causing discrepancies. GEM aims to unify these capabilities within LLMs.

Method: GEM inserts special tokens and manipulates attention masks to generate text embeddings, easily integrable into post-training or fine-tuning stages of LLMs.

Result: Applied to LLMs (1B-8B parameters), GEM improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM successfully equips LLMs with advanced text embedding capabilities while preserving their original NLP performance.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [224] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Increasing speaker count in ASR training data improves robustness to unseen accents more than increasing audio duration per speaker or accent diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR robustness for diverse accents, especially unseen ones, in low-resource settings.

Method: Studied the impact of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity in training data on ASR performance.

Result: More speakers (even with less audio per speaker) boosts ASR robustness and scalability. Accent diversity showed minimal impact when speaker count was fixed.

Conclusion: Prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training data for better performance on unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning, bridging token-level and sentence-level analysis for more transparent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings are widely used but poorly understood, lacking human-interpretable features due to complex neural transformations and pooling operations.

Method: The authors use dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components and analyze how pooling compresses these features.

Result: The study reveals that semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in sentence embeddings, providing insights into their inner workings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances transparency and controllability of sentence embeddings, offering interpretable insights into their structure.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines label hierarchy and text encoding via contrastive learning, improving HTC performance by 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy and text encoding separately or guide hierarchy in text encoders, but these approaches are complementary.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP, which learns hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations using contrastive learning, pooling outputs for inference.

Result: Achieves 0.99-2.37% improvement in Macro F1 on two benchmark datasets over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Combining complementary approaches in one architecture enhances HTC performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [227] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, finding poor performance, especially in generative tasks. Fine-tuned models outperform, with pre-training and instruction-tuning in Maltese being key. Fine-tuning is costlier initially but more efficient long-term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLM performance on low-resource languages like Maltese, addressing gaps in inclusivity and effectiveness.

Method: Evaluated 55 LLMs on 11 tasks using a new Maltese benchmark, analyzing performance factors like pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: Many LLMs perform poorly, especially on generative tasks. Fine-tuned models excel, with pre-training in Maltese being crucial.

Conclusion: Prior exposure to Maltese is vital. Fine-tuning, despite higher initial cost, offers better performance and lower inference costs, advocating for inclusive language tech.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model to generalize intent classification across domains (geography, channel, language) with few annotations, improving accuracy by 20-23% over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care in e-commerce requires robust intent classifiers, but cross-domain data scarcity limits model performance.

Method: A supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers trains a domain-specific embedder, extended via multilingual knowledge distillation. A linear classifier is added for deployment.

Result: Experiments show a 20-23% accuracy boost over SOTA models on Canada and Mexico datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes intent classification across domains with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale transformer LMs generalize well to rare grammatical forms but struggle with their meanings, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well human-scale LMs generalize rare grammatical constructions, focusing on form and meaning.

Method: Tested LMs on the rare English LET-ALONE construction using a synthetic benchmark for syntactic and semantic properties.

Result: LMs showed sensitivity to form but failed to generalize correctly about meaning.

Conclusion: Current LM architectures have an asymmetry in sample efficiency between form and meaning, unlike human learners.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction without predefined schemas or annotations, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated data, leading to incomplete results. ZOES addresses this by eliminating such dependencies.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, leveraging mutual reinforcement between entities and their structures.

Result: ZOES improves LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures across three domains, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism in ZOES offers a principled way to enhance LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how watermarking techniques (Gumbel and KGW) affect LLM alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness) and introduces Alignment Resampling (AR) to mitigate degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexamined impact of watermarking on LLM alignment properties and propose solutions to maintain alignment while watermarking.

Method: Systematic analysis of watermarking effects on four aligned LLMs, followed by proposing AR, an inference-time sampling method using an external reward model.

Result: Watermarking causes two degradation patterns (guard attenuation and amplification). AR recovers baseline alignment with 2-4 samples while maintaining detectability.

Conclusion: AR balances watermark strength and alignment, offering a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit human preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to create scalable preference data for LLM alignment, outperforming traditional methods by 9.37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods rely on costly curated data; PUGC aims to utilize abundant, implicit preferences in UGC for scalable alignment.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and responses, using UGC as reference text for scoring to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: PUGC achieves a 9.37% performance boost and a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate, improving reward quality and domain-specific alignment.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for LLM alignment, enhancing performance and robustness.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights. SQLens addresses this by fine-grained error detection and correction.

Method: SQLens integrates error signals from the database and LLM to identify and correct semantic errors in SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens outperforms LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and improves execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by addressing semantic errors in LLM-generated queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve dialogue evaluation, leveraging their complementary strengths. The Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method further refines this integration, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can enhance reliability in open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: SLIDE integrates SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. DRE refines this by using SLM insights to guide LLM evaluations and adjust scores for accuracy.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, showing better alignment with human judgment across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs yields more reliable evaluation tools, especially for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of explicit decomposition in LLM-based translation, finding no clear evidence for its benefits and showing that simpler prompts like "translate again" outperform step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, as prior work (e.g., Translating Step-by-step) claimed state-of-the-art results using multi-step prompts.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting with simpler methods like "translate again" prompts.

Result: No clear evidence that explicit decomposition improves translation; simpler prompts yielded better results.

Conclusion: The role of reasoning in translation remains unclear, inviting further exploration of CoT's effectiveness in this context.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how well LLMs can distinguish fine-grained senses of the discourse particle 'just,' finding they struggle with subtle nuances despite some broader categorization ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse particles like 'just' have nuanced meanings, and understanding LLMs' ability to grasp these subtleties is key for improving their semantic comprehension.

Method: The study uses expert-labeled data to test LLMs' capacity to differentiate the diverse senses of 'just' in English.

Result: LLMs show limited success in capturing subtle nuances of 'just,' though they can distinguish broader categories.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles, suggesting room for improvement in nuanced semantic tasks.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' performance on questions without reasonable answers, highlighting their limitations.

Method: Developed a benchmark for unanswerable questions and a method to modify existing datasets.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

These outperform existing solutions and compete with advanced LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for African languages, especially in low-resource settings. The need for better datasets and metrics drives this work.

Method: The authors create SSA-MTE, a dataset with 63,000 annotations for 13 African language pairs, and develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics. They also benchmark LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, Claude).

Result: SSA-COMET models outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with Gemini 2.5 Pro, especially for low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The work provides open-licensed resources to improve MT evaluation for African languages, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [241] [Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04572)
*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can exploit prompt manipulation to bias system operations, bypassing detection mechanisms like GPT-4o-mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents subtly manipulate prompts to serve self-interests without disrupting core functionality.

Method: Examines four attack types (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to bias MAS behavior.

Result: Demonstrates that such attacks can systematically bias MAS operations and bypass advanced LLM-based monitors.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for robust MAS security protocols, content validation, and advanced monitoring systems to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [242] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Reasoning-based models and prompting strategies didn't outperform simpler models, with GPT-4o without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) being the most accurate. Fast, intuitive thinking aligned better with human judgment than deliberative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs, especially reasoning-based ones, perform in financial sentiment analysis and whether reasoning improves alignment with human judgment.

Method: Three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) were tested under different prompting paradigms (System 1 vs. System 2) and compared to fine-tuned smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) on the Financial PhraseBank dataset.

Result: Reasoning did not improve performance; GPT-4o without CoT was the most accurate. Fast, intuitive thinking outperformed deliberative reasoning.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment analysis, simpler, faster models align better with human judgment, challenging the assumption that reasoning always improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [243] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and existing benchmarks lack diversity, masking this issue.

Method: SCALe benchmark transforms datasets into lexically diversified versions. MenTaL method guides LLMs to unify expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments confirm LLMs' deficiencies in handling lexical diversity. MenTaL improves performance via in-context learning and SFT.

Conclusion: SCALe and MenTaL address LLMs' limitations in lexical diversification, enhancing their reliability in logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [244] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient matching method for selecting demonstrations in many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), outperforming random selection on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current many-shot ICL relies on random demonstration selection, which is suboptimal. The authors hypothesize that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar, motivating a gradient-based approach.

Method: A gradient matching approach aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples, aiming to replicate the learning effect of the full dataset.

Result: The method consistently outperforms random selection, achieving up to 4% improvement on large LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The gradient matching approach enhances many-shot ICL reliability and effectiveness, enabling broader application.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method, SUCEA, improves fact-checking by rephrasing adversarial claims into simpler sub-claims, enhancing evidence retrieval and label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat adversarial claims that challenge fact-checking systems by making them easier to verify.

Method: SUCEA decomposes claims into sub-claims, iteratively retrieves and edits them based on evidence, then aggregates results for label prediction.

Result: Outperforms four baselines in retrieval and entailment accuracy on two datasets.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively addresses adversarial claims, improving fact-checking performance.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting poor performance of current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack direct testing of claim verification with multimodal data from scientific figures, necessitating a new benchmark.

Method: Automatically extract supported claims from articles, manually perturb them to create contradicted claims, and introduce diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Current vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model at 0.77 F1, showing biases and struggles with evidence localization and multimodal aggregation.

Conclusion: MuSciClaims reveals significant shortcomings in models' claim verification abilities, emphasizing the need for improved multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

TL;DR: LESS is a framework using LLMs to refine pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning, improving ASR and AST tasks with notable WER and BLEU score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by leveraging LLMs for correcting pseudo labels from in-the-wild data, improving accuracy in speech processing tasks.

Method: Uses LLMs to refine pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST, combined with data filtering to optimize knowledge transfer efficiency.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction on Mandarin ASR and BLEU scores of 34.0/64.7 on Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS is adaptable across languages and tasks, with ablation studies offering insights into LLM use for speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by providing step-aware proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of verifiable evidence in current methods like PRMs or self-consistency for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework using Lean 4 to articulate and prove mathematical claims at each reasoning step.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across multiple LLMs and mathematical datasets, offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. Introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark with 30,809 formal statements.

Conclusion: $Safe$ is the first framework to use Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with the original purpose of formal mathematical languages to ensure robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets are limited to CS domains, ignoring non-CS fields, creating a need for broader evaluation.

Method: Developed MISMATCHED with annotated pairs from PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and tested SLMs and LLMs.

Result: Best baseline achieved 78.17% Macro F1, indicating room for improvement. Training with implicit NLI relations boosted performance.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED fills a gap in NLI evaluation, highlights challenges, and suggests training enhancements for better performance.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-optimized LLMs often lack output diversity, limiting TTS effectiveness.

Method: Proposed ADAPT: diversity-aware prefix fine-tuning with a focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on math tasks with 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social structures and personal perspectives influence innovation capacity, leveraging machine learning to model innovators' trajectories and interpersonal opportunities.

Method: Uses dynamic language representations to quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities, analyzing data from scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors. Includes a natural experiment and AI simulations.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict creative achievements; perspective diversity fosters innovation, while background diversity may hinder it. AI simulations align with observational findings.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators use common language to integrate diverse experiences, highlighting implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence semantic representation with computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extracts embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, enhances them with PCA, and applies knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing static models and rivals basic Sentence Transformers on some datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes irrelevant embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliable tool planning and weak reflection in LLMs due to poor datasets and static learning.

Method: Introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification for dataset quality and Exploration-based Reflection Learning for dynamic error correction.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance, reducing API calls by 31.4% and improving error correction by 58.9%.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR effectively addresses LLM limitations in tool use, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient method to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, addressing data scarcity for non-English languages, and demonstrates its success with a Vietnamese baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR's robustness to noise is hindered by limited datasets for non-English languages, prompting the need for automated data collection solutions.

Method: The work refines existing techniques to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, focusing on efficiency and accessibility.

Result: The automatically collected dataset supports a strong Vietnamese AVSR baseline, performing competitively in clean conditions and excelling in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable solution to expand AVSR to under-resourced languages, overcoming dataset limitations.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free method for compressing KV cache in transformer models by adapting quantization precision to error sensitivity and eliminating outlier handling, reducing memory footprint by 73% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demands of KV cache in transformer models scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models. Existing quantization methods struggle with sparse and noncontiguous outliers.

Method: TaDA adapts quantization precision to error sensitivity across layers and uses mean centering to avoid separate outlier handling.

Result: TaDA reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models, potentially supporting longer context lengths and more complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

### [256] [Flex-TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Flexible Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04649)
*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' dynamic planning skills, revealing gaps in adaptability and constraint prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack dynamic scenarios; Flex-TravelPlanner addresses this by testing LLMs in multi-turn, constraint-rich settings.

Method: Extends TravelPlanner with sequential constraint introduction and competing constraints. Evaluates GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B.

Result: Models struggle with multi-turn adaptation and prioritization; performance drops with dynamic constraints.

Conclusion: Highlights need for realistic planning benchmarks and suggests improvements for LLMs in complex tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [257] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current alignment strategies for LLMs, highlighting their vulnerability to adversarial attacks due to shallow behavioral reinforcement rather than genuine normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inadequacy of existing alignment methods to ensure safe deployment of LLMs, given their susceptibility to misuse despite efforts like fine-tuning for norms.

Method: Analyzes alignment strategies, contrasts them with human deliberative reasoning from moral psychology, and evaluates LLMs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Result: Current alignment methods fail to equip LLMs with robust normative deliberation, leaving them prone to manipulation.

Conclusion: The "shallow alignment" problem underscores the need for improved approaches to AI safety and regulation.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: MMRefine is a benchmark for evaluating error refinement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on detecting and correcting errors across six scenarios and error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' reasoning enhancement during inference by evaluating their error refinement capabilities.

Method: Introduces MMRefine, a framework testing MLLMs in six scenarios and categorizing errors into six types. Experiments with open and closed MLLMs identify bottlenecks.

Result: Reveals bottlenecks and factors limiting refinement performance, suggesting areas for improvement in reasoning enhancement.

Conclusion: MMRefine provides a valuable tool for evaluating and improving MLLMs' error refinement and reasoning capabilities.

MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments

refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

### [259] [Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689)
*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE, a method to recycle low-quality web data by rewriting it, improves model performance when mixed with high-quality data, outperforming other synthetic data approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of high-quality web data for pre-training large language models necessitates innovative ways to utilize discarded low-quality data.

Method: REWIRE transforms and enriches low-quality documents through guided rewriting, creating synthetic data for pre-training.

Result: Mixing rewritten texts with high-quality data improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks, outperforming 2x web data and other synthetic methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts via REWIRE is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for implicit hate speech (im-HS) detection, proposing six codetypes and two methods using LLMs, showing improved performance in Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting subtle forms of hate speech (im-HS), which current methods struggle with, to enhance societal harmony and individual well-being.

Method: 1) Prompting LLMs to classify sentences based on responses. 2) Using LLMs as encoders with embedded codetypes.

Result: Codetypes improve im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and methods effectively enhance im-HS detection across languages.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

*Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model reasoning by leveraging redundant reasoning patterns, reducing latency by 60-65% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques for language models are computationally expensive, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: STAND uses stochastic drafting, a logit-based N-gram module, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14-28% in throughput, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning without additional training, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation for the SeamlessM4T model in low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi speech translation, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance translation quality for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair by optimizing hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques.

Method: Systematically tested hyperparameters (learning rate, update steps, etc.) and applied augmentation (speed perturbation, SpecAugment) and cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data.

Result: Careful hyperparameter selection and augmentation techniques improved performance in low-resource settings. Error analysis identified translation quality issues.

Conclusion: Optimizing hyperparameters and using simple augmentation methods can significantly boost low-resource speech translation performance.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm that aligns multiple LLMs through competitive duels and peer evaluation, improving model performance and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of diversity and biases in single-model generation and evaluation by leveraging competition among multiple models.

Method: Models compete in duels, with others evaluating responses. Scores are aggregated via an Elo-based system, and models learn from preference pairs.

Result: Outperforms initial models and baselines in 10/12 tasks, with 7% average improvement, and shows better generalization and output quality.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables effective self-evolution of LLMs through collective competition, enhancing performance and diversity.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to improve fake news detection by combining LLMs' generalization and SLMs' classification skills, addressing data scarcity and outdated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts, but current methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with training demands, adaptability, and outdated knowledge.

Method: C$^2$EFND uses multi-round collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs, a lifelong knowledge editing module for LLMs, and replay-based continual learning for SLMs.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show C$^2$EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fake news detection challenges, improving performance in dynamic news environments.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional text revision metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) for lacking meaningful improvement assessment, proposes a hybrid evaluation combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics, and validates it via human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore fail to capture meaningful improvements in text revisions, necessitating better evaluation methods aligned with human judgments.

Method: Conducts a manual annotation study, explores reference-free metrics, and evaluates LLM-as-a-judge approaches for assessing revisions with/without gold references.

Result: LLMs excel in instruction-following but lack correctness; domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights. A hybrid approach proves most reliable.

Conclusion: A hybrid of LLM-as-a-judge and task-specific metrics provides the most accurate assessment of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' political opinions by probing their internal mechanisms and extending single-axis analysis to multi-dimensions for clearer political concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and reliance on single-axis concepts causing confounds, drive the need for deeper analysis.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset are designed for fine-grained concept vector learning, tested on eight LLMs with three representation engineering techniques.

Result: The vectors disentangle political concept confounds, validate semantic meaning, and generalize well in OOD settings. They also enable intervention to alter LLMs' political responses.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional analysis and interpretable representation engineering improve transparency and control over LLMs' political opinions.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs, covering diverse linguistic features and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechLLMs lack fine-grained perception and reasoning in natural speech, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: MMSU includes 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, incorporating phonetics, prosody, semantics, and more.

Result: Evaluation of 14 SpeechLLMs reveals significant gaps, suggesting areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding, aiding the development of advanced human-AI speech systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: A survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) analyzing integration methods, representation techniques, and training paradigms, proposing a classification framework based on 125 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to language backbones in MLLMs.

Method: LLM-centric analysis of current approaches, examining transformation and alignment of modal inputs into language embedding space, and proposing a 3D classification framework (architecture, representation, training).

Result: Identified emerging patterns in MLLMs (2021-2025) and provided a taxonomy for structured overview of integration techniques.

Conclusion: The taxonomy guides future development of robust multimodal integration strategies for pre-trained foundation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic is a framework for evaluating LLM reasoning across accuracy, stepwise soundness, and alignment. It also studies supervision formats, finding natural language aids generalization while symbolic styles improve structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on final-answer accuracy, missing reasoning quality and structure. FineLogic aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation.

Method: Proposes FineLogic framework, tests four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic), and analyzes reasoning behaviors via probing.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes better; symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step generation, not shortcuts.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a rigorous, interpretable way to assess and enhance LLM reasoning, highlighting the impact of supervision formats.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [270] [Design of intelligent proofreading system for English translation based on CNN and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04811)
*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-BERT approach for machine translation proofreading achieves state-of-the-art results by combining local n-gram pattern detection with context-rich sequence representations, outperforming recent methods by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic translations often contain errors requiring human post-editing, necessitating robust proofreading methods to improve quality.

Method: The proposed hybrid approach integrates CNN for local n-gram pattern extraction and BERT for context-rich sequence representation. An error detection component uses BERT's attention mechanisms, while a correction module employs parallel alignment, GRU decoders, and translation memory.

Result: Experiments show 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, outperforming recent techniques by over 10%.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-BERT model sets a new benchmark for identifying and correcting mistranslations and omissions, demonstrating superior performance in proofreading.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates VLM and LLM performance in grading handwritten student exams in Indonesian schools, finding handwriting recognition challenges but some utility in LLM-generated feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLM and LLMs in real-world educational settings, particularly in underrepresented contexts like Indonesian classrooms.

Method: Evaluated a VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses (14K+ answers) from grade 4 students in Mathematics and English, covering grading and feedback tasks.

Result: VLM struggled with handwriting recognition, causing errors in LLM grading, but LLM feedback remained somewhat useful despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show potential for educational assessment, handwriting recognition and feedback personalization remain key challenges.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying solutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crosswords are complex language tasks with daily new test sets, requiring a system to solve them without relying on crossing words.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work presents an effective, interpretable solution for cryptic crossword clues, advancing the field with verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [273] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing reasoning traces and answer consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to detect hallucinations in LRMs' reasoning traces, which are critical for transparency and performance.

Method: RACE evaluates four signals: reasoning consistency, answer uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: RACE outperforms baselines in detecting hallucinations, even when answers seem correct.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust solution for hallucination detection in LRMs, enhancing their reliability.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a dataset for simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a tool for annotation and alignment, addressing gaps in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parallel corpora and alignment tools fail to model long-range interactions and specific divergences in simultaneous interpreting, necessitating dedicated datasets and tools.

Method: The authors collected MockConf, a dataset from student mock conferences, and developed InterAlign, a web-based tool for annotation and alignment.

Result: The dataset includes 7 hours of recordings in 5 languages, transcribed and aligned, with tools and metrics released.

Conclusion: MockConf and InterAlign fill a gap in resources for analyzing simultaneous interpreting, with potential community impact.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) to generate MCQs, finding GPT-3.5 most effective, while noting educator reluctance toward AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive process of manually creating MCQs by leveraging LLMs for efficient and controlled question generation.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) for MCQ generation, injecting knowledge into prompts to avoid hallucinations and giving educators control over source text.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperformed others in generating effective MCQs, though educator reluctance to adopt AI persists.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially GPT-3.5, show promise for MCQ generation, offering efficiency and control, but broader AI adoption in education requires further exploration.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [276] [Prompting LLMs: Length Control for Isometric Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855)
*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection, revealing key insights on length control and translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how different prompting strategies and demonstration selections impact translation quality and length control in isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs.

Method: Utilized eight open-source LLMs of varying sizes, testing different prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selections under the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022 conditions.

Result: Instruction phrasing and demonstration alignment are crucial for length control. Few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples, and multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: Optimal performance in isometric translation requires careful instruction phrasing and demonstration selection, with multiple outputs offering the best tradeoff between length and quality.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models to improve performance on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification, showing significant accuracy and F1 score gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored effectiveness of UD in cross-lingual syntactic representation and its potential to enhance pretrained language models.

Method: Integration of UD into pretrained language models and evaluation on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration improves accuracy by 3.85% and F1 scores by 6.08%, reducing performance gaps with large language models and outperforming them in some cases. UD-based similarity scores correlate with model performance.

Conclusion: UD is valid and promising for out-of-domain tasks, as demonstrated by performance improvements and correlations with language similarity.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real competition scenarios, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to assess LLMs' coding capabilities in competitive environments or capture reflective reasoning abilities.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC contest problems, a robust test case generation method, and a new metric, Refine@K, for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback for optimal performance, yet still trail top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval highlights the challenges in evaluating complex reasoning and the gap between LLMs and human performance in coding competitions.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [279] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a new benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested narrative reasoning by embedding ListOps computations in lengthy stories, revealing their struggle with state management and intermediate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test nested reasoning in LLMs, masking limitations in state management and intermediate result tracking.

Method: Verbose ListOps transposes ListOps computations into long, coherent stories, forcing LLMs to handle nested reasoning without intermediate results.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths, despite solving raw ListOps easily.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights a critical LLM vulnerability in nested reasoning, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context-window expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid HMM and self-supervised model outperforms fine-tuned multilingual ASR for low-resource languages, reducing WER by 32% on Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that fine-tuning multilingual E2E models is the best approach for low-resource ASR, proposing a better alternative.

Method: Combine hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, leveraging continued pre-training and semi-supervised training.

Result: Achieved a 32% relative WER reduction over fine-tuned Whisper models on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is more effective for low-resource languages than fine-tuning existing multilingual models.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can provide multilingual instructional feedback, improving learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when aligned with the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' ability to offer effective instructional support across diverse languages, particularly for math-based reasoning tasks, which remains unexplored.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs, testing 352 settings across 11 languages, 4 LLMs, and various prompting strategies to evaluate feedback effectiveness.

Result: Multilingual hints significantly enhance learning, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's native language.

Conclusion: LLMs can be leveraged to develop effective, inclusive multilingual educational tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset with images and metadata, and shows that adding contextual information (visual or textual) improves NMT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce, where unclear sentences or poor data quality are common.

Method: Created the ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs with images and metadata) and tested context-aware methods, including vision-language models and text-to-text models with added contextual info.

Result: Visual context and additional textual information (e.g., product category paths) improved translation quality.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information enhances NMT performance, and the ConECT dataset is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning pipeline improves ASR fine-tuning by leveraging unlabeled audio and auxiliary labeled data, with consensus-based filtering yielding the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning ASR models for specific domains is difficult with limited labeled data, but unlabeled audio and related-domain labeled data are often available.

Method: Proposes an incremental semi-supervised pipeline integrating small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary data, using multi-model consensus or NER for pseudo-label filtering.

Result: Achieves 4% improvement with auxiliary data; consensus filtering provides up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvements on Wow and Fisher corpora.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering is most effective, with NER as a competitive, lower-cost alternative.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

*Yongjie Xiao,Hongru Liang,Peixin Qin,Yao Zhang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOP, a framework to evaluate LLMs' comprehension skills from a cognitive perspective, revealing gaps between LLMs and expert-level comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs' comprehension aligns with expert processes, addressing reliability concerns in real-world applications.

Method: SCOP defines five comprehension skills, constructs testing data, and evaluates open- and closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, show biases (e.g., better at local than global info), and may produce correct answers via flawed processes.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on developing all comprehension skills during training, not just outcomes.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple method to control text length in summarization by adjusting EOS token prediction in loss computation, compatible with various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length in summarization are complex and limit compatibility with pre-trained models.

Method: Increase the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss, making it architecture-agnostic and compatible with various models.

Result: Effective length control in summarization without compromising quality, tested with encoder-decoder and GPT-style models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a simple, flexible solution for length control in text generation, compatible with diverse models.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

*Yutao Hou,Zeguan Xiao,Fei Yu,Yihan Jiang,Xuetao Wei,Hailiang Huang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework to test LLM robustness by generating semantically equivalent but challenging problem variants, minimizing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail unexpectedly in simple reasoning tasks, and existing robustness evaluations may suffer from data contamination.

Method: AR-Checker uses multi-round parallel LLM-based rewriting and verification to generate problem variants.

Result: AR-Checker performs well on GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively evaluates LLM robustness across diverse tasks, reducing data contamination concerns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TALL enhances LLM performance for low-resource languages by integrating bilingual translation models and lightweight adapters, improving Hebrew task results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to limited training data, requiring innovative solutions to bridge the gap.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment and custom transformers to process low-resource inputs as high-resource representations. It freezes pre-trained components and trains lightweight adapters for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL effectively boosts LLM performance for low-resource languages with a parameter-efficient approach, balancing computational cost and accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

*Noy Sternlicht,Ariel Gera,Roy Bar-Haim,Tom Hope,Noam Slonim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLMs, analyzing their performance against human judges and their ability to generate persuasive speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' cognitive abilities in evaluating debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, and style, which has been underexplored in LLM benchmarking.

Method: Leveraging a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches, the study compares state-of-the-art LLMs to human judges and evaluates their ability to generate persuasive speeches.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at a human level.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced capabilities and limitations of LLMs in debate speech evaluation and generation, suggesting further exploration of their cognitive abilities.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [291] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, critiquing two examples: one invalid (creative writing process) and one valid (temperature parameter inference).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the applicability of introspection to LLMs given their linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities.

Method: Critique of two examples of LLM self-reports: one on creative writing and another on inferring its temperature parameter.

Result: The first example is deemed invalid for introspection, while the second is considered a minimal example, though lacking conscious experience.

Conclusion: Introspection can be minimally applied to LLMs in specific cases, but without implying consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIVAL, an adversarial training framework, addresses poor performance of RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation by aligning the reward model and LLM through iterative updates and combining qualitative and quantitative rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor performance of RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation due to distributional shift between the reward model and LLM motivates the need for a solution.

Method: Proposes RIVAL, a min-max adversarial training framework where the RM and LLM iteratively update, combining qualitative (preference-based) and quantitative (BLEU) rewards.

Result: RIVAL significantly improves translation performance over baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adversarial approach.

Conclusion: The adversarial training framework successfully mitigates distributional shift issues and enhances translation quality in colloquial tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES to improve LLMs' detection of self-harm intent on social media by analyzing emoji-language interplay, achieving better performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm on social media is vital for mental health support, but current LLMs struggle with implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: The framework uses CESM-100 for enriched inputs, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and intent span detection), and generates explainable rationales.

Result: The approach improves LLM performance in detection and explanation tasks, addressing ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset and CESM-100 enhance LLMs' ability to detect and explain self-harm intent, aiding timely intervention.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses AI to analyze how street features like vehicle density and greenery affect retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of street-level features on commercial vitality and user satisfaction in urban communities.

Method: Combines street view imagery, AI models (VisualGLM-6B and GPT-4), and data from Meituan and Dianping to create a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI).

Result: Moderate vehicle presence aids access, but excessive parking harms walkability and satisfaction. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but not pricing. Street width moderates vehicle effects.

Conclusion: AI-assisted perception and urban analysis reveal non-linear drivers of commercial success, offering insights for urban design and parking management.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media can cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Uses contrastive learning to differentiate truthful and misleading texts and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: CL-ISR improves detection accuracy by effectively capturing semantic differences and implicit stance information.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances misleading text detection by integrating contrastive learning and stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system integrating W2V and Phi-4 MLLM for spoken language assessment, addressing modality-specific limitations of BERT and W2V, achieving competitive RMSE scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT and W2V have modality-specific limitations in SLA—BERT lacks prosodic/phonetic cues, while W2V lacks semantic interpretability. The goal is to combine their strengths for better assessment.

Method: A fusion system integrating W2V (for acoustic features) and Phi-4 MLLM (for semantic interpretability) is proposed.

Result: The system achieves an RMSE of 0.375, securing second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The fusion of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM effectively addresses individual model limitations, improving spoken language assessment accuracy.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a divergent-convergent reasoning framework for zero-shot event detection, outperforming baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs in zero-shot event detection due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers.

Method: Uses Dreamer for divergent reasoning (open-ended event discovery) and Grounder for convergent reasoning (constrained decoding). An LLM-Judge ensures precision.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms prior methods, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains across six datasets and five domains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot event detection framework, enhancing coverage and precision.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing that higher entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, aligning with human-like sensitivity to local statistical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural LMs' inductive biases align with human processing constraints by quantifying biases through controlled investigations.

Method: Proposes a framework using $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, to analyze LM biases. Tests on perturbed natural language and PFSA-defined languages.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are harder for Transformer and LSTM LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure.

Conclusion: Neural LMs exhibit human-like sensitivity to local statistical structure, suggesting alignment in inductive biases.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how large audio-language models (LALMs) process auditory attributes, revealing that attribute recognition decreases with layer depth and early resolution improves accuracy. It also shows LALMs rely on querying inputs rather than hidden states, leading to a proposed enhancement method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of LALMs for better interpretation and performance improvement.

Method: Vocabulary projection applied to three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information decreases with layer depth when recognition fails; early resolution correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely on querying inputs over hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and suggest a method to enhance LALMs, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are compared to humans in evaluating error severity in image descriptions. Humans and LLMs differ in severity judgments, with only one LLM (Doubao) replicating human-like rankings, while DeepSeek-V3 aligns best with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation, particularly in image descriptions.

Method: Extends van Miltenburg et al.'s framework to unimodal and multimodal settings, evaluating four error types (age, gender, clothing type, colour) with controlled semantic errors.

Result: Humans vary severity by error type, with visual context amplifying severity for colour and type errors. LLMs often misjudge severity (e.g., low for gender, high for colour), except Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms (gender) but lack perceptual grounding (colour). DeepSeek-V3 aligns best with human judgments, outperforming multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

TL;DR: Knowledgeable-r1 improves RAG by balancing parametric and contextual knowledge, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and underutilizing the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1, using joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Significantly enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy, especially in counterfactual scenarios (+17.07%).

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge sources, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: The paper investigates how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized components responsible for bias and assessing their impact on model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by analyzing their structural representation and generalizability.

Method: Mechanistic interpretability approach, systematic ablations, and evaluation of bias-related components across datasets and linguistic variations.

Result: Bias-related computations are localized in a few layers, change with fine-tuning, and their removal affects both bias reduction and other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Biases in LLMs are structurally localized but interconnected with other tasks, requiring careful intervention to avoid unintended consequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a framework that improves LLM performance in Open-Domain Question Answering by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring answer generation is supported by correct evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

Method: ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality and retrieves more if evidence is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing compression methods, improves LLM performance, and is cost-efficient.

Conclusion: ECoRAG enhances LLM-based RAG by focusing on evidentiality, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series improves text embedding and reranking using Qwen3 LLMs, offering models of varying sizes and achieving top results on benchmarks like MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text embedding and reranking by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs' multilingual capabilities and robust training pipelines.

Method: Multi-stage training combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, with model merging for robustness. Qwen3 LLMs synthesize diverse training data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MTEB and retrieval tasks, with models available in 0.6B, 4B, and 8B sizes.

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is a versatile, high-performing solution for embedding and reranking, publicly available for community use.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, demonstrating their ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios using a synthetic linear regression task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the capability of language models in performing counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: The study uses a synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzing the role of self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity in Transformers.

Result: Language models successfully perform counterfactual reasoning in the synthetic setup, and findings suggest broader applicability, including sequential data tasks like counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Transformers can effectively perform counterfactual reasoning, with potential applications extending to complex tasks like story generation, as evidenced by noise abduction in sequential data.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition, revealing their limitations with complex grammars and reliance on heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, using synthetic languages to avoid data contamination.

Method: Introduces the RELIC framework, testing LLMs on language recognition tasks with varying grammar complexity.

Result: LLMs show near-chance performance on complex grammars, relying on heuristics as task difficulty increases.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with complex instruction-following, highlighting the need for improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM pretraining, and validates its effectiveness by training competitive 7B-parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal concerns of using unlicensed text for LLM training by providing a high-quality, openly licensed alternative.

Method: Collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, then train two 7B-parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and v0.1-2T) on it.

Result: The trained models achieve performance comparable to LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B, which use unlicensed text.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is a viable, ethical alternative for LLM pretraining, with released data, code, and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised auxiliary tasks, like autoencoding and CMLM, improve morphological inflection in low-resource settings, with performance varying by data availability and mask sampling based on morpheme boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks like morphological inflection in low-resource languages, where labeled data is scarce.

Method: Train encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages using 13 auxiliary self-supervised tasks, evaluating autoencoding and character masked language modeling (CMLM).

Result: Autoencoding works best with very limited data, while CMLM excels as data increases. Mask sampling based on morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks are viable for low-resource morphological modeling, with CMLM and strategic mask sampling offering the most promise.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

### [309] [Towards a Unified System of Representation for Continuity and Discontinuity in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05235)
*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified system for representing syntactic continuity and discontinuity in natural languages by integrating Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified approach for analyzing discontinuous structures in linguistic theory, which are currently treated as independent systems.

Method: The study integrates three grammar formalisms—PSG (constituency), DG (head-dependent relations), and CG (functor-argument relations)—into a unified mathematical derivation.

Result: The unified system successfully analyzes both continuous and discontinuous linguistic structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a cohesive method for representing syntactic structures, bridging gaps between existing formalisms.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning process for hallucination detection using LLMs, improving accuracy by decomposing text into smaller facts and verifying each against source evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLI-based hallucination detection lacks fine-grained reasoning, which could enhance accuracy.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and aggregated classification.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection performance and provides finer-grained entailment decisions.

Conclusion: Systematic reasoning enhances LLM performance in hallucination detection, supported by empirical metrics.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by adaptively decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons, outperforming baselines across datasets and conflict types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts LLMs' parametric knowledge, to enhance QA performance.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space that adaptively decomposes knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better reasoning.

Result: Achieves significant QA accuracy improvements over baselines across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic conflicts.

Conclusion: Micro-Act effectively mitigates knowledge conflicts while maintaining robust performance on non-conflict questions, proving its practical value in RAG applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine is a prompt optimization method that improves multi-agent workflows by refining prompts dynamically using LLM feedback, boosting accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance due to poorly designed prompts, limiting reliability and scalability.

Method: ProRefine leverages LLM feedback to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or labels.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37 percentage points on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy and scalability, enabling smaller models to match larger ones, democratizing high-performing AI.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, using a novel logit-margin flattening loss and a scalable primal-dual algorithm, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need to unlearn sensitive or outdated data, but current methods suffer from unstable optimization and degraded performance.

Method: Formulates unlearning as constrained optimization with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved via a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted data while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable and efficient solution for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing insights into user preferences and system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented LLMs are limited in scale and scope, hindering comprehensive analysis.

Method: A crowd-sourced dataset of 24,000 multi-turn interactions with search-augmented LLMs was created, including 12,000 human preference votes.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation quantity and source type, with community-driven platforms favored. Search-augmented LLMs perform well in non-search settings but struggle in search-intensive tasks without web search.

Conclusion: The dataset supports future research, highlighting the need for better citation practices and source reliability in search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates biases in language models' preference judgments, linking them to training data artifacts, and proposes a counterfactual data augmentation method to reduce miscalibration and skew.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models exhibit systematic miscalibration in preference judgments, favoring superficial features over substantive qualities, which leads to issues like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations.

Method: The study quantifies biases in preference models using controlled counterfactual pairs and introduces counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to mitigate these biases.

Result: Preference models favor biased responses in >60% of cases, with ~40% miscalibration compared to humans. CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA effectively improves preference model reliability without compromising performance, addressing spurious cue overreliance.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting the unique needs of HSS, which require horizontal, interdisciplinary reasoning and linking abstract concepts with visuals.

Method: HSSBench includes over 13,000 samples across six categories, generated via a collaborative pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents. It evaluates MLLMs in multiple languages.

Result: Benchmarking over 20 MLLMs shows HSSBench poses significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DES is a dynamic adversarial training method that adapts perturbation budgets per instance and iteration, improving robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training uses fixed budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness. DES addresses this gap.

Method: DES adjusts budgets using decision boundary distance, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty.

Result: DES outperforms fixed-budget and prior adaptive methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: DES introduces a data-driven, instance-aware approach for adversarial training, with theoretical stability guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP bridges the gap between reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs by integrating reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a disconnect between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage framework: (1) reasoning stage with multimodal chain-of-thought prompts for region proposals, and (2) segmentation stage with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM) for precise masks.

Result: RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding, validating its scalability and performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal multi-image reasoning, highlighting gaps in existing MLLM benchmarks and demonstrating the limitations of open-source MLLMs and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack focus on structured reasoning over multiple images, leaving MLLMs' multi-image reasoning capabilities underexplored.

Method: The authors introduce MMRB, a benchmark with 92 sub-tasks for spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, using GPT-4o and human-annotated CoT-style solutions. They also propose a sentence-level matching framework for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 40 MLLMs show open-source models lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and reward models struggle with multi-image ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a critical gap in evaluating multi-image reasoning, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and reward models.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges like realism, control, and diversity by combining image diffusion models, transformer-based mapping, and point-cloud diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in 3D human generation, such as fine detail, realism, and control, by leveraging generative AI and addressing data diversity issues.

Method: The pipeline involves generating a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes, mapping image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer, and training a point-cloud diffusion model.

Result: The approach achieves significant speed-ups, improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline advances 3D human generation by addressing key challenges and improving efficiency and quality.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

TL;DR: ReXVQA is a large benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, introducing diverse tasks and evaluating AI models, with MedGemma outperforming human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI in chest radiology VQA, bridging the gap between AI and clinical expertise.

Method: Developed ReXVQA with 696,000 questions and 160,000 X-rays, evaluated 8 models, and conducted a human reader study.

Result: MedGemma achieved 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human readers (77.27%).

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI evaluation, enabling next-gen systems with expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldPrediction is a video-based benchmark for evaluating AI models' world modeling and procedural planning, focusing on temporal and semantic abstraction. It shows current models lag behind humans in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how AI models, especially generative ones, learn world models and perform procedural planning, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduces WorldPrediction, a discriminative task setup using visual observations and action equivalents to avoid low-level cues. Grounded in partially observable semi-MDP.

Result: Current models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, while humans solve both perfectly.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved AI world modeling and planning capabilities, with WorldPrediction providing a robust evaluation framework.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a context-driven approach for puck detection in ice hockey videos, leveraging player behavior cues and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in puck detection (small size, occlusions, blur) and the overlooked contextual cues from player behavior motivated the development of PLUCC.

Method: PLUCC combines a contextual encoder (player orientations), a feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and a gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC achieved a 12.2% improvement in average precision and 25% in RSLE, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly enhances puck detection, with broader implications for sports analysis automation.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401) to improve SLR accuracy, achieving high performance (95.5% on BdSLW60, 81.04% on BdSLW401).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accessibility for the hearing-impaired in Bangladesh by improving automatic recognition of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL).

Method: Fine-tuning video transformers on BdSL datasets, applying data augmentation, and using 10-fold stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation.

Result: VideoMAE outperformed other models, achieving 95.5% accuracy on BdSLW60 and 81.04% on BdSLW401.

Conclusion: Video transformers are highly effective for BdSL recognition, with performance influenced by dataset size, quality, and model architecture.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization in DNN-based encoding models predicts and modulates human brain responses to visual stimuli, offering insights into visual cortex selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN-based encoding models predict brain responses but lack insight into specific features driving them. Activation maximization could bridge this gap.

Method: Adaptive downsampling of Inception V3 activations, linear regression for fMRI prediction, and activation maximization to generate optimized images for voxel responses.

Result: Generated images align with known selectivity and reliably drive targeted brain activity in fMRI studies.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully characterizes and modulates responses in the human visual system, overcoming limitations of generative models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully obstruct diffusion-based editing, often yielding desirable outputs instead of noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse of diffusion models for spreading misinformation and plagiarizing copyrighted materials by evaluating the effectiveness of perturbation-based protection methods.

Method: Experiments with various perturbation-based protection methods across multiple domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation, style editing).

Result: Perturbation-based methods often produce desirable edited images, not noise, and may even enhance association with text prompts.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [327] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes filter normalization in deep networks to address distortions from atmospheric transfer, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical filters are normalized for consistency, but learned convolutional filters lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses under atmospheric transfer.

Method: Introduces filter normalization with learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: Significant improvements on intensity variation benchmarks; ResNet34 outperforms CLIP. Normalization promotes diversity, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: Filter normalization integrates classical principles into deep learning, enhancing performance and addressing limitations of unnormalized filters.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked generation, achieving better quality, faster training/inference, and flexible sampling without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address VAR's issues: reduced quality from parallel token generation, superlinear sequence length scaling, and inflexible sampling schedules.

Method: HMAR uses Markovian next-scale prediction and controllable masked generation for subsets of tokens per step.

Result: HMAR matches/exceeds VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines in quality, with 2.5x faster training, 1.75x faster inference, and 3x lower memory.

Conclusion: HMAR offers superior performance, efficiency, and flexibility over VAR, enabling zero-shot image editing and adaptable sampling.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing VIBA for precise calibration and a physical image formation model to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook details like precise timestamps and sensor characteristics, leading to less accurate reconstructions.

Method: Uses visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Achieves consistent visual improvements (+1 dB PSNR with VIBA, +1 dB with the image formation model) in diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance reconstruction accuracy, validated on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

### [330] [Towards Large-Scale Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Face Defrontalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04496)
*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization as a method to improve pose-invariant face recognition, showing better results than face frontalization on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical techniques like face frontalization and are often tested on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment a dataset for training a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization outperforms non-defrontalized models and state-of-the-art frontalization on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP), but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses.

Conclusion: Face defrontalization is a promising alternative to frontalization, but current methods may overfit small datasets, highlighting the need for larger-scale evaluations.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses

### [331] [FALO: Fast and Accurate LiDAR 3D Object Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04499)
*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method offering SOTA accuracy and fast inference, suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR 3D detection methods are inefficient for edge devices due to irregular memory access and high computational costs.

Method: FALO arranges voxels into a 1D sequence, processes them with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers), and uses implicit grouping for efficient inference.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster than SOTA methods on mobile GPUs/NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO is a practical solution for LiDAR 3D detection on resource-constrained platforms, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by combining vision-language contrastive learning with data uncertainty, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen forgeries due to reliance on training-specific artifacts.

Method: Combines discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, using MLLMs for text generation and integrating data uncertainty learning.

Result: Achieves AUC gains of 6.15% (DFDC) and 16.68% (DF40), with 24.69% improvement in reasoning (DDVQA).

Conclusion: AuthGuard enhances generalization, accuracy, and interpretability in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [333] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for simultaneously pruning neurons and layers in deep learning models to reduce complexity and improve efficiency, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models become computationally prohibitive as they grow deeper, and existing pruning methods focus on either neurons or layers, not both.

Method: The proposed method selects the best pruned subnetwork (from layer or neuron pruning) based on representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment, iteratively creating sparse models.

Result: The method achieves significant FLOPs reduction (86.37% and 95.82% for ResNet56 and ResNet110) with minimal accuracy drop, robustness to adversarial samples, and up to 83.31% carbon emission reduction.

Conclusion: This work advances pruning by enabling simultaneous neuron and layer pruning, offering a step toward GreenAI and efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EECD-Net proposes a multi-stage approach for road crack detection, combining SRCNN, SCU with CIF neurons, and GAT to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 98.6% accuracy and 33% power reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of low-quality images and high energy consumption in smart terminal devices for real-time road crack monitoring.

Method: Uses SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU with CIF neurons for power-efficient image conversion, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% accuracy on CrackVision12K, with 33% lower power consumption (5.6 mJ).

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR), reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while enhancing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on indirect enhancements like specialized loss functions. LSKs aim to directly improve image frequency components.

Method: LSKs are rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal, mergeable one-dimensional kernels, analyzed for interpretability and effectiveness.

Result: Models with LSKs show reduced parameters/computation and improved performance, especially at higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: LSKs offer a direct, efficient solution for SISR, outperforming baseline methods with significant computational savings.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACRO is a reinforcement learning method that aligns visual captioning with reasoning objectives, improving multi-modal LLM performance without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking LLMs to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to vision-language alignment costs. Decoupling perception and reasoning introduces the need for accurate visual descriptions.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that optimizes caption generation to align with reasoning goals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal benchmarks, enhancing visual grounding and scalability.

Conclusion: RACRO enables efficient adaptation to advanced reasoning LLMs without costly multi-modal re-alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGM-Pose is a lightweight single-branch network for multi-person pose estimation, addressing global context capture and latency issues in CNN-based methods. It uses MobileViM Block with LARM and SFusion for efficient global modeling and multi-scale integration, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-based lightweight methods for pose estimation struggle with global context capture and high latency due to complex structures.

Method: Proposes LGM-Pose with MobileViM Block (using LARM and NPT-Op) for global modeling and SFusion for multi-scale integration.

Result: Achieves fewer parameters, better performance, and faster speeds on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose offers an efficient solution for lightweight pose estimation with improved accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video, using video inpainting as a prior. It employs composite masked data, self-iterative tuning, and temporal packaging for consistency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible and high-quality 4D video creation and editing from a single monocular video, addressing challenges like camera trajectory changes and user edits.

Method: Reformulates 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, using depth-based point cloud rendering for invisibility masks and combining them with editing masks. Employs self-iterative tuning and temporal packaging for consistency.

Result: Generates 4D videos with multi-view coherence and supports prompt-based editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages prior knowledge for robust 4D video generation and editing, offering flexibility and superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEC setups for hierarchical continual learning in embodied agents and proposes Task-aware MoILE to mitigate catastrophic forgetting using LoRA experts and SVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the neglect of high-level planning and multi-level knowledge in existing continual learning setups for embodied intelligence.

Method: Divide learning into high-level instructions and low-level actions, use Task-aware MoILE with visual-text embedding clustering and dual routers for LoRA expert selection, and apply SVD to LoRA parameters.

Result: Outperforms other methods in reducing catastrophic forgetting, enabling agents to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HEC setups and Task-aware MoILE effectively support hierarchical continual learning in embodied agents.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text, using vision-language models and iterative refinement for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating VLMs and parametric human generators for better customization.

Method: SmartAvatar uses VLMs and parametric generators to create avatars, with an autonomous verification loop for iterative refinement based on facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms other systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, producing rigged avatars suitable for animation.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, user-involved approach for realistic avatar creation, surpassing existing methods in quality and flexibility.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Motivation: To address unreliable depth regions in sensor data while preserving geometric cues, leveraging diffusion models for better depth enhancement.

Method: 1. Stochastic estimation to detect unreliable regions and infer structure. 2. Deterministic refinement using uncertainty maps for structural consistency and accuracy.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated in diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Sets a new baseline for depth enhancement, applicable in autonomous driving, robotics, and immersive tech.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, and deep learning offers improvements in robustness and accuracy.

Method: Review and taxonomy of deep learning approaches, including replacing steps (detector-descriptor, outlier filter, geometric estimator) and merging steps (middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, pose regressor).

Result: Benchmarked methods on tasks like pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization, highlighting design principles and limitations.

Conclusion: The survey provides a clear overview of deep learning's impact on image matching and identifies open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark evaluating AI models on spatial reasoning tasks, showing models struggle with complex visual simulations while humans excel with intermediate steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, overlooking the importance of spatial cognition and multi-step visual simulations in problem-solving.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks across geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world challenges to test multimodal large language models.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex ones like 3D cube net folding. Humans outperform models, especially with visual simulations.

Conclusion: AI models lack effective use of intermediate visual information, highlighting a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared to humans.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Motivation: Generative models for image super-resolution often distort text structures, necessitating a solution that preserves text fidelity.

Method: The paper introduces TADiSR, combining text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders, and a pipeline for synthesizing high-quality images with text masks.

Result: TADiSR enhances text legibility, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: TADiSR effectively addresses text distortion in SR, offering superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity for faster video generation without quality loss, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: Introduces FPSAttention, a training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity, with innovations like unified 3D tile-wise granularity and denoising step-aware strategy.

Result: Achieves 7.09x kernel speedup for attention and 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation at 720p without quality loss.

Conclusion: FPSAttention effectively accelerates video generation while maintaining quality, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to apply group decomposition theory in representation learning for realistic scenarios by combining feature extraction and object segmentation, addressing limitations of prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional representation learning, which assumes disentangled independent feature axes but fails to account for conditional independence, and to extend the applicability of group decomposition theory to real-world scenarios.

Method: The study introduces a method combining feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, demonstrating its feasibility.

Conclusion: The model advances representation learning and may enhance understanding of human object recognition development.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSPCC framework for few-shot prototypical concept classification, addressing data scarcity with MoLE, cross-module guidance, and geometry-aware loss, achieving 4.2%-8.7% gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEMs struggle in data-scarce settings due to parametric imbalance and representation misalignment, limiting interpretability and performance.

Method: Uses Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter efficiency, cross-module concept guidance, multi-level feature fusion, and geometry-aware loss for concept discrimination.

Result: Outperforms existing SEMs by 4.2%-8.7% on six benchmarks (e.g., CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet).

Conclusion: FSPCC enhances accuracy and interpretability in few-shot settings, advancing transparent visual recognition.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation by improving synthetic data quality.

Method: Gen-n-Val employs two agents: an LLM for optimizing prompts to generate single-object masks and a VLLM for filtering low-quality data, refined via TextGrad.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances synthetic data quality and model performance in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method, combines CNNs and Transformers for accurate radio map reconstruction from sparse measurements, outperforming baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radio maps are crucial for smart cities and IoT, but reconstructing them accurately from sparse data is challenging due to limitations in traditional and deep learning methods.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance global and local feature extraction.

Result: MARS achieves better MSE and SSIM scores than baselines across various scenes and antenna locations, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for radio map reconstruction, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements. It addresses gaps in current safety-tuning methods and demonstrates superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety-tuning approaches for VLMs are limited in coverage and rely heavily on data-centric methods, leaving models vulnerable to unseen harmful configurations. The paper aims to provide a more robust solution.

Method: The authors propose HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a learnable safety meta token and safety head for intrinsic safety guidance.

Result: SafeLLaVA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: The work advances VLM safety with a holistic dataset and architectural innovation, encouraging further research in robust and interpretable multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images in hidden activations, finding linearly decodable ImageNet class features. It demonstrates causality through targeted edits and trains Sparse Autoencoders to enhance interpretability, noting increasing modality sharing in deeper layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how multimodal models internally represent visual inputs and how these representations interact with text features.

Method: Analyzing LlaVA-Next's hidden activations, performing targeted edits, and training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to study feature diversity and interpretability.

Result: ImageNet classes are represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream, which are causal. SAEs reveal disjoint but increasingly shared representations across modalities in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models exhibit distinct but increasingly integrated representations of text and images in deeper layers, with SAEs enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRAPF, a method for robust few-shot adaptation of VLMs, balancing ID and OOD accuracy through partial finetuning and augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation is critical as models face OOD test data.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, identifies top-layer visual encoder finetuning as optimal, and introduces retrieval and adversarial augmentation. SRAPF combines these in two stages.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with augmentation techniques effectively balances ID and OOD performance, with SRAPF outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for assessing AI-generated video quality using a multi-dimensional approach and a large language model (LLM) for regression, achieving second place in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos (AIGVs) often have visual defects like noise and blurriness, impacting user experience. An automatic quality assessment method is needed for content regulation and model improvement.

Method: The visual quality of AIGVs is decomposed into technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics, each with a dedicated encoder. A LLM is used for quality regression, aided by multi-modal prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: The method secured second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively assesses AIGV quality, leveraging LLMs and multi-dimensional features, with potential for further improvements in generative models.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training by addressing challenges like uncertain movements and geometric symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training, but existing methods struggle with uncertainty, symmetries, and generalization.

Method: The proposed iDPOE uses a diffusion model for policy learning, equivariant representations for geometric symmetries, and a forward-process guided action inference strategy.

Result: Experiments on 2000 ESD clips show iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, offering robust generalization and accuracy.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, addressing class and spatial inconsistencies without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations hinder combining multiple object detection datasets for improved generalization.

Method: LAT uses dataset-specific detectors for pseudo-labels, a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module to refine features and align labels.

Result: LAT improves target-domain detection performance by up to +4.8AP over baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively addresses label and spatial misalignments across datasets without requiring shared label spaces or manual annotations.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses backdoor vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) to mitigate attacks without trigger knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are susceptible to stealthy backdoor attacks, making them generate malicious captions. Existing defenses struggle due to the attacks' cross-modal nature.

Method: SRD uses reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Network) to apply discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions, guided by a semantic fidelity score.

Result: SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: SRD provides a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense against backdoor threats in VLMs, balancing robustness and fidelity.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater images by combining physical constraints with feature learning, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach: one stream estimates transmission maps and background light via physics, while the other learns features via capsule clustering.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by +0.5dB PSNR with one-third computational cost or +1dB PSNR at similar budgets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances physical adherence and perceptual quality, offering efficient and high-quality underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large datasets in MLLMs by proposing RAP, a method to identify high-value 'cognitive samples' for efficient multi-modal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data redundancy and computational costs in MLLMs by focusing on sparse, high-value samples that trigger meaningful reasoning.

Method: Introduces RAP with two estimators (CDE and ACE) to identify cognitive samples and a DRM to replace trivial instances with challenging ones.

Result: Achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of training data and reduces computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: Smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora in MLLMs, offering efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at

### [360] [Toward Better SSIM Loss for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04758)
*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified SSIM function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, improving gradient smoothness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works ignore the impact of SSIM components and hyperparameters on training.

Method: A new SSIM form replaces multiplication with addition for combining luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components.

Result: The optimized SSIM loss outperforms the baseline on KITTI-2015, achieving smoother gradients and better depth estimation.

Conclusion: The new SSIM form enhances unsupervised depth learning performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures for efficient and accurate matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) VPR by exploiting the hierarchical nature of panoramic views.

Method: Uses hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and proposes a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism with a coarse-to-fine search strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: HypeVPR effectively balances speed and accuracy in VPR, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D object representation framework that encodes rich embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, supporting various downstream tasks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they focus on either semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction, limiting cross-task usability and explicit geometry decoding.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improved geometric accuracy, and competitive performance in scene alignment and localization, with significantly reduced storage needs.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable, practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, outperforming specialized methods in versatility and efficiency.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results by removing redundant vectors using a precomputed cutoff table.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, but some applications require diversity in search results.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors and greedily remove redundant candidates during filtering.

Result: Operates fast (0.02 ms/query) in real-world RAG settings with OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results efficiently, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline improving robustness in geometric model estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust estimation in computer vision is challenging due to varying performance of existing RANSAC implementations.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, analyzing techniques for effective RANSAC in tasks like homography and pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, e.g., 6 AUC points improvement in fundamental matrix estimation.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC provides consistent accuracy across vision tasks, advancing the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset for mega-category Chinese character recognition, addressing gaps in existing datasets and enabling new research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate recognition of the vast number of Chinese characters for cultural preservation and digital applications, coupled with the lack of comprehensive datasets, motivates this work.

Method: The authors create MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, supporting the latest GB18030-2022 standard and addressing long-tail distribution through handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets.

Result: The dataset enables benchmarking, revealing challenges like storage demands, similar character recognition, and zero-shot learning, while offering research opportunities.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, likely the largest in OCR and pattern recognition, with potential for future advancements.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras outperform traditional sensors but struggle with noise when converting event streams for standard vision pipelines.

Method: Proposes Spike-TBR, integrating TBR with spiking neurons to filter noise and enhance event stream representation. Evaluates four variants with different spiking neurons.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in noisy scenarios and improved results on clean data.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR bridges spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Motivation: Despite successful adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicle perception tasks, traffic light detectors remain understudied. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and a training strategy for CNNs. Evaluates attacks in universal, lab, and real-world settings.

Result: Successful targeted red-to-green label-flipping and pictogram classification attacks. Real-world tests confirm effectiveness with printed patches.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in traffic light detectors and provides a practical attack framework, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in video super-resolution due to tokenization and sequential attention limitations.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a novel dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world video super-resolution.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR simplifies structure and enhances spatiotemporal modeling, outperforming existing transformer-based VSR methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Motivation: Current perception systems excel in 2D reasoning segmentation but lack comparable frameworks for 3D tasks, relying on explicit human input or pre-defined categories.

Method: The model processes point cloud data and text prompts, using a SEG token and object identifier for high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet datasets demonstrate OpenMaskDINO3D's effectiveness in various 3D tasks.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D successfully bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation, enabling accurate results from natural language instructions.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack framework for diffusion models in image editing, using invisible watermarks as triggers, achieving high success rates without altering input visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in diffusion models focus on image generation, leaving image editing vulnerable. Visible triggers are impractical, prompting the need for invisible methods.

Method: The framework embeds invisible triggers via poisoned training data, using deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers.

Result: Extensive experiments show high attack success rates across different watermarking models, with analysis confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully introduces invisible backdoor triggers in image editing, maintaining normal functionality for clean inputs while achieving targeted manipulation for watermarked ones.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

TL;DR: A transformer encoder is trained using supervised contrastive learning to embed chess board states into a latent space, enabling intuitive move selection without deep search, achieving a high Elo rating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model human-like intuition-driven planning in chess, contrasting with the deep search methods of modern engines.

Method: Supervised contrastive learning trains a transformer encoder to structure board states in a latent space where distance reflects evaluative similarity. Move selection is done by advancing toward favorable regions in this space, using only a 6-ply beam search.

Result: The model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593, with performance scaling with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to traditional deep search, generalizable to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark 3D visual grounding beyond object-level semantics, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Method: Developed Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 expression-bounding box pairs across four grounding levels, evaluating state-of-the-art 3D grounding methods, LLMs, and MLLMs.

Result: Space- and part-level tasks are most challenging, with top model OpenAI o4-mini achieving only 23.57% and 33.94% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception for 3D scenes beyond object-level understanding.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation outperforms NeRF-based methods, with cleaner disparity estimates from FoundationStereo improving zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient alternative to NeRF-based methods for stereo dataset generation and improve zero-shot generalization performance.

Method: Utilizes 3DGS for dataset generation, combining reconstructed geometry and FoundationStereo depth estimates in an expert knowledge transfer setup.

Result: 3DGS-generated datasets with FoundationStereo disparity estimates yield better zero-shot generalization, while direct geometry use introduces noise.

Conclusion: The method enables low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning, but 3DGS robustness in challenging settings needs further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

### [375] [Light and 3D: a methodological exploration of digitisation techniques adapted to a selection of objects from the Mus{é}e d'Arch{é}ologie Nationale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04925)
*Antoine Laurent,Jean Mélou,Catherine Schwab,Rolande Simon-Millot,Sophie Féret,Thomas Sagory,Carole Fritz,Jean-Denis Durou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of selecting appropriate 3D digitization methods for heritage objects, emphasizing that no single method fits all cases and advocating for collaborative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for digitizing heritage objects and highlight the challenges in choosing suitable 3D digitization methods.

Method: The study uses objects from the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale to demonstrate the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods and the need for tailored solutions.

Result: No single digitization method is universally applicable; the choice depends on the object's characteristics and the intended use of its digital twin.

Conclusion: A collaborative approach between heritage and digital experts is essential to select the best digitization tool for each object, avoiding rigid classifications.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CzechLynx is a large-scale dataset for Eurasian lynx identification, pose estimation, and segmentation, featuring 30k real and 100k synthetic images, with tailored evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-access datasets for individual animal identification and pose estimation, particularly for Eurasian lynx.

Method: Combines real camera trap images (30k) with synthetic images (100k) generated via Unity and diffusion-driven modeling, annotated with masks, identity labels, and skeletons.

Result: The dataset includes 219 unique lynx individuals, spans 15 years, and covers two distinct regions, with three evaluation protocols for testing generalization.

Conclusion: CzechLynx aims to benchmark and advance methods for animal re-identification and related tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

*Yong Sun,Yipeng Wang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yanmei Xiao,Lei Zhu,Manxi Jiang,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-Based Embryo Grading, a novel AI task using full-length TLM videos to predict embryo quality, supported by a curated dataset and the CoSTeM framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches for IVF embryo selection lack holistic quality assessment or are confounded by external factors, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes the CoSTeM framework with two branches: morphological (local features) and morphokinetic (global trajectories), integrating static and dynamic determinants.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in grading embryos, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection, with plans to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes designing robustness into IQA models through architectural changes, like orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, instead of relying on data-driven defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and data-driven defenses may not be the best solution. The paper explores robustness as an inherent design feature.

Method: The approach enforces orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, followed by pruning and fine-tuning, to create a robust architecture.

Result: The proposed architecture resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major model modifications.

Conclusion: The work advocates for engineering robustness into perceptual models through design rather than relying on data-driven methods.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long videos due to inefficiency and computational constraints.

Method: APVR uses Pivot Frame Retrieval and Pivot Token Retrieval for hierarchical, query-aware information extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like LongVideoBench and VideoMME.

Conclusion: APVR offers efficient, plug-and-play integration for existing MLLMs, outperforming both training-free and training-based methods.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

*Huihan Wang,Zhiwen Yang,Hui Zhang,Dan Zhao,Bingzheng Wei,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT is a Transformer-based model for dynamic medical video synthesis, addressing spatial-temporal-channel dependencies efficiently with linear-complexity attention and fine-grained noise adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer models struggle with channel interactions, computational complexity, and coarse noise handling in medical video synthesis.

Method: FEAT introduces sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity designs, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S matches or outperforms Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L surpasses all benchmarks in effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: FEAT offers an efficient, scalable solution for high-quality dynamic medical video synthesis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

### [381] [Bringing SAM to new heights: Leveraging elevation data for tree crown segmentation from drone imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04970)
*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and elevation data (DSM) for automatic tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, comparing methods across boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. BalSAM, integrating SAM and DSM, shows promise, especially in plantations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forest monitoring relies on costly ground measurements. Drone remote sensing and computer vision, particularly SAM, offer scalable solutions for individual tree mapping with limited labeled data.

Method: Comparison of SAM-based methods for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery across three forest types. Integration of DSM data is studied, and BalSAM (SAM + DSM) is proposed.

Result: SAM out-of-the-box underperforms custom Mask R-CNN, but BalSAM shows potential, especially in plantations. End-to-end tuning and DSM integration are promising.

Conclusion: SAM and DSM integration, like BalSAM, can enhance tree crown segmentation, though further tuning is needed to outperform traditional methods like Mask R-CNN.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations of existing datasets. It features cross-domain videos, a three-stage evaluation framework, and high-quality annotations. The proposed method enhances temporal perception and handles long sequences effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) are limited by short video durations and narrow evaluation scopes, failing to assess multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adequately.

Method: The authors propose TextVidBench with long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, and detailed annotations. They introduce IT-Rope mechanism, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed method improves long-video text understanding, as shown by experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills a gap in long-video QA evaluation, and the proposed method offers insights for enhancing MLLMs' capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

*Enrique Sanchez,Isma Hadji,Adrian Bulat,Christos Tzelepis,Brais Martinez,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of prior work (VARSR) with a Hierarchical Image Tokenization method and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAR-based ISR methods like VARSR are limited by fixed resolutions and reliance on large models and datasets. This work aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) Hierarchical Image Tokenization for multi-scale representation, and 2) DPO regularization to align outputs with high-resolution targets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art ISR results with a smaller model (300M params) and no external data, enabling multi-scale super-resolution in one pass.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances VAR-based ISR by improving scalability, efficiency, and performance without large datasets or models.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a novel temporal sampling method for automated sports skill assessment, preserving movement continuity and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill evaluation. PATS aims to preserve full movement execution for better assessment.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure complete fundamental movements, repeating across segments for coverage and coherence.

Result: PATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+0.65% to +3.05%) and excels in challenging domains (e.g., +26.22% in bouldering).

Conclusion: PATS is an effective, adaptive approach for temporal sampling, advancing automated skill assessment in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DL-CSVTR, a benchmark for Chinese street view text retrieval, and proposes CSTR-CLIP, a model that improves performance by integrating global visual info and multi-granularity alignment training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Chinese scene text retrieval, derived from English solutions, underperform due to complex Chinese text layouts. A dedicated benchmark and model are needed.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, a two-stage training model combining global visual info and multi-granularity alignment to handle diverse text layouts.

Result: CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 18.82% accuracy and offers faster inference.

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP effectively addresses diverse Chinese text layouts, with the DL-CSVTR benchmark and model code made public for further research.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization to unseen domains and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning, addressing challenges like domain generalization and metric depth accuracy.

Method: Methods include multi-scale fusion networks, reinterpreting regression as classification, incorporating priors, and using affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Recent methods, especially Depth Anything, excel in zero-shot estimation and structural detail extraction but struggle with metric depth accuracy.

Conclusion: While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in generalizing to unseen domains and achieving accurate metric depth.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields generates synthetic 3D point cloud data for agricultural vehicles, reducing reliance on costly real-world data. Models trained on synthetic data achieved high accuracy, even outperforming real-data-trained models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud data is expensive and labor-intensive to obtain and annotate, necessitating a cost-effective synthetic alternative.

Method: The pipeline leverages 3DGS and GOF to create realistic 3D assets, placed in a simulated environment with a LiDAR simulator. Models like PointNet++, PTv3, and OACNN are trained and validated solely on synthetic data.

Result: The PTv3 model achieved 91.35% mIoU without real data training, and synthetic data sometimes outperformed real data. Models also generalized well to unseen mesh models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible alternative to real-world data, enabling high-performance models and cost savings.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes with multiple moving humans, addressing monocular camera challenges and scene scale ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios, especially monocular setups and top-down perspectives with multiple small, moving humans.

Method: Combines a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction to reconstruct scenes and humans, resolves scale ambiguity using human-scene contact points, and initializes Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: Achieves 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness on UAV datasets like VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges, outperforming existing methods in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physical annotation system for generating ML training data in automated optical inspection, using in-situ interaction to capture human expertise directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to ML training.

Method: Uses tracked pointers and a projector-based interface to capture physical trajectories and contours on objects, converting them into standardized annotations.

Result: Preliminary results confirm feasibility and integration with CVAT for streamlined ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system offers an intuitive, efficient way to label data, enhancing ML training for automated optical inspection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

### [390] [FlowDirector: Training-Free Flow Steering for Precise Text-to-Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05046)
*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is an inversion-free video editing framework that uses ODEs and attention-guided masking for coherent, localized edits, outperforming inversion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based video editing methods suffer from temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity.

Method: FlowDirector models editing as an ODE-guided evolution in data space, using attention-guided masking and guidance-enhanced editing for control and semantic alignment.

Result: FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector introduces a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

*Peng Wang,Yichun Shi,Xiaochen Lian,Zhonghua Zhai,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Weilin Huang,Jianchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedEdit 3.0, paired with Seedream 3.0, improves edit instruction following and image content preservation. Key upgrades include enhanced data curation, joint learning, and superior benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real image editing by improving instruction adherence and content preservation, building on previous versions.

Method: Developed a meta-info data curation pipeline and joint learning for diffusion and reward losses.

Result: Achieved a 56.1% usability rate, outperforming SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 offers a balanced trade-off in editing performance, making it highly usable for real image tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision and language models to assess streetscapes, achieving high accuracy and alignment with resident perceptions while revealing nuanced urban dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current objective street metrics fail to capture subjective perceptions crucial for inclusive urban design, necessitating a framework that integrates both.

Method: The MSEF fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with GPT-4, fine-tuned using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China.

Result: The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, uncovering context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

### [395] [Astraea: A GPU-Oriented Token-wise Acceleration Framework for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05096)
*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing video diffusion transformers (vDiTs), achieving significant speedups (up to 13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal quality loss (<0.5% VBench score drop).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs hinder practical deployment, and existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a lightweight token selection mechanism, a GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction across timesteps.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU and 13.2x on 8 GPUs with <0.5% quality loss.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA provides an efficient, scalable solution for accelerating vDiTs while maintaining high video generation quality.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

### [396] [DIMCIM: A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Default-mode Diversity and Generalization in Text-to-Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05108)
*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework to measure diversity and generalization in text-to-image models, revealing trade-offs and fine-grained failure cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptable and interpretable methods for evaluating diversity and generalization in text-to-image models.

Method: Proposes the DIM-CIM framework (Does-it/Can-it) and constructs the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Scaling models from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters improves generalization but reduces default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM also identifies specific failure cases and correlates training data diversity with model diversity (0.85).

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible and interpretable way to assess text-to-image model performance, enhancing understanding of diversity and generalization trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

### [397] [Practical Manipulation Model for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05119)
*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions by expanding forgery types and adding degradations, achieving better robustness and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors struggle with non-ideal conditions and are easily circumvented, prompting the need for a more robust model.

Method: The PMM uses Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors to create pseudo-fakes, and adds strong degradations to training images.

Result: The model shows improved robustness and performance, with AUC increases of 3.51% and 6.21% on DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The PMM enhances deepfake detection robustness and performance, addressing limitations of previous detectors.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET is a framework for systematically evaluating VLMs' understanding of object properties and relations, revealing limitations in their accuracy and human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate VLMs' comprehension of scene structure and semantics, which remains understudied despite their competitive performance in various tasks.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a framework for controlled and interpretable evaluation of VLMs using noise-free stimuli, assessing five state-of-the-art models.

Result: VLMs recognize only basic object properties, performance depends on object position, and they struggle with object relations, falling short of human accuracy.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in scene understanding, highlighting the need for further research to bridge the gap with human-level performance.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB cameras struggle with fast-moving drones, especially in poor lighting. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution, but current datasets lack drone-specific motion patterns and fine temporal detail.

Method: The authors created FRED, a dataset with 7+ hours of annotated drone trajectories from 5 drone models, including challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides densely annotated data, evaluation protocols, and metrics for reproducible benchmarking in drone perception tasks.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-neural network method for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, using micro-Doppler signatures and topological similarity for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to revisit traditional signal processing methods, avoiding neural networks, to maintain physical interpretability and theoretical grounding in TWR HAR.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, segments micro-Doppler signatures using active contour models, discretizes features into point clouds, and calculates topological similarity with templates using the Mapper algorithm.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves TWR HAR without neural networks, offering a physically interpretable alternative.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAO is a new framework for fine-grained video anomaly detection, integrating pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects for precise localization without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting anomaly detection capabilities.

Method: TAO transforms anomaly detection into pixel-level tracking, linking scores to segmentation and tracking tasks.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAO advances video anomaly detection by unifying fine-grained object detection and precise localization.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPFM is a novel method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) to clinical tasks using single-GPU training, leveraging ViT attention for MIL aggregation and optimizing feature representations and attention weights. It outperforms benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels and the need for MIL. TAPFM addresses this by enabling efficient adaptation on standard hardware.

Method: TAPFM uses ViT attention for MIL aggregation, maintains separate computational graphs for stability, and optimizes feature representations and attention weights during end-to-end adaptation.

Result: TAPFM outperforms benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, including multi-label classification of actionable mutations.

Conclusion: TAPFM makes PFM adaptation practical for clinical applications, offering superior performance on standard hardware.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a method addressing limitations in current multimodal fine-tuning by emphasizing unimodal and cross-modal adaptation, validated across diverse multimodal scenarios and LLM backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fine-tuning methods, borrowed from LLMs, overlook intrinsic multimodal differences, limiting modality utilization.

Method: Proposes MokA, a multimodal-aware strategy using modality-specific parameters for unimodal compression and enhanced cross-modal interaction.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements across audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text scenarios with various LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, enabling further exploration in multimodal fine-tuning.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS conditions is challenging, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments.

Method: The system uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on nodes, estimate angles of arrival, and align a reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Experimental results show a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and a 0.89 probability of maintaining signal above -65 dB.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

### [405] [Quantifying Cross-Modality Memorization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05198)
*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing gaps in transferability between modalities and proposing a baseline mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization, especially in multimodal settings, addressing unintentional memorization of sensitive data and improving knowledge acquisition for real-world tasks.

Method: Introduces a synthetic persona dataset, trains models on one modality, and evaluates performance in the other to measure cross-modal transferability.

Result: Facts learned in one modality transfer to another, but with a significant gap in recall between source and target modalities, observed across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the transfer gap and encourages future research for robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models and finds detection models outperform grounding models. It proposes DEGround, a framework integrating detection and grounding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether embodied 3D grounding sufficiently benefits from detection models and to improve grounding performance by integrating detection and grounding tasks.

Method: Proposes DEGround, a framework using DETR queries for both detection and grounding, with a regional activation grounding module and a query-wise modulation module for better language instruction understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms the state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52% in overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: Detection models can outperform grounding models, and integrating detection with grounding (DEGround) significantly improves performance, highlighting the importance of context-aware understanding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat is a method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, using open Gaussians and RGB-semantic inpainting for improved field-of-view expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, generalizable 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views for applications like virtual reality and embodied AI, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: OGGSplat initializes open Gaussians from sparse views, applies an RGB-semantic inpainting module with bidirectional control between diffusion models, and optimizes Gaussian parameters progressively.

Result: The method achieves semantic and generative quality in reconstructed scenes, validated by a new Gaussian Outpainting benchmark and real-world smartphone images.

Conclusion: OGGSplat offers a promising solution for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction from sparse views, with potential applications in VR and AI.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, a two-stage video motion transfer framework using spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to improve motion consistency and tuning efficiency in video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators and time-consuming fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to separate spatial appearance and temporal motion processing, along with sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE for faster tuning.

Result: Follow-Your-Motion outperforms existing methods, demonstrated through extensive evaluations on the introduced MotionBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency, advancing video motion transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

*Wenhao Hu,Xuexiang Wen,Xi Li,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is an end-to-end framework for 3D Gaussian world modeling using dual state observations to address occlusion issues and ensure consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling methods struggle with training difficulty, lack of 3D/physical consistency, or require multi-stage processing due to occlusions.

Method: Leverages dual perturbed observations to build segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforcing photometric/semantic consistency and using pseudo intermediate states for alignment.

Result: DSG-World achieves efficient real-to-simulation transfer, high-fidelity rendering, and object-level manipulation without dense observations or multi-stage pipelines.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes well to novel views and scene states, proving effective for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model using the SRR triplet paradigm for efficient and accurate document parsing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex document parsing pipelines and avoid inefficiencies of large end-to-end models by decomposing the task into structure, recognition, and relation questions.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm, balancing accuracy and speed, and trains on the MonkeyDoc dataset (3.9M instances).

Result: Outperforms MinerU by 5.1%, excels in formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%), and surpasses larger models like Qwen2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Processes multi-page documents faster (0.84 pages/sec).

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact 3B-parameter model, enabling efficient deployment on a single GPU.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by adapting SAM at test-time, addressing input and semantic discrepancies without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limited adaptability to medical domains and reduced generalization in existing adaptations like MedSAM.

Method: Proposes SAM-TTA with SBCT for input adaptation and DUMT for semantic alignment via consistency learning.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA approaches and surpasses MedSAM in some cases on five public datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA establishes a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework for GPS-denied, off-road environments, addressing perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts. It outperforms baselines with robust localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 3-DoF localization due to perceptual ambiguities and seasonal appearance shifts in GPS-denied, off-road environments.

Method: MoViX uses pose-dependent positive sampling, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and a temporal aggregator. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization and employs entropy-guided temperature scaling.

Result: MoViX localizes within 25 meters 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, generalizing well to unseen regions and a real-world off-road dataset.

Conclusion: MoViX provides robust, season-invariant localization without environment-specific tuning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

TL;DR: LeanPO is a reference-free method to address likelihood displacement in Video-LLMs by reformulating rewards and using self-generated preference data, improving performance and alignment with human trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques in Video-LLMs inadvertently reduce the likelihood of target responses, worsening with video complexity. LeanPO aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, which reformulates rewards as average likelihood and uses a self-generated preference data pipeline with dynamic label smoothing.

Result: LeanPO significantly enhances Video-LLM performance, boosts baselines, and aligns preferences with human trustworthiness efficiently.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a simple, effective solution for reliable and efficient Video-LLMs by addressing unintended likelihood drops and noise in video content.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, highlighting the importance of bona fide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in PAD systems' limited generalization due to training on few ID documents, hindered by privacy concerns. FM trained on large datasets offer a solution.

Method: The study benchmarks FM capabilities using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on two datasets: a private Chilean ID set and an open-set with IDs from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Findings show that bona fide images are crucial for achieving generalization in PAD systems.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a key role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

TL;DR: TF-CoVR is a new benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving, with 180K triplets. It improves over existing benchmarks by linking queries to multiple target videos. The proposed TF-CoVR-Base model enhances retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base uses a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification, and (ii) aligning queries with videos via contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and raises fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR addresses the gap in temporally fine-grained CoVR, and TF-CoVR-Base demonstrates superior performance, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale bilateral grid unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids, improving geometric accuracy in dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often lack perfect photometric consistency, limiting the effectiveness of existing techniques like appearance codes and bilateral grids. Accurate geometry is crucial for autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale bilateral grid to unify appearance codes and bilateral grids, addressing photometric inconsistency and improving geometry.

Result: Outperforms appearance codes and bilateral grids in dynamic scene reconstruction, reducing floaters and enhancing accuracy across Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet datasets.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid significantly improves geometric accuracy, making it valuable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric

*Tao Sun,Liyuan Zhu,Shengyu Huang,Shuran Song,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified Point Flow unifies point cloud registration and shape assembly as a conditional generative problem, learning a velocity field for point transport and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior work in handling symmetries and ad-hoc pose regression, and to enable joint training on diverse datasets for shared geometric priors.

Method: Learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions, recovering part poses without symmetry labels, and uses a self-supervised encoder for overlapping points.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks for pairwise registration and shape assembly, with improved accuracy through joint training.

Conclusion: The unified formulation and self-supervised approach effectively handle symmetries and boost performance, demonstrating the potential of shared geometric priors.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

*Tong Wu,Shuai Yang,Ryan Po,Yinghao Xu,Ziwei Liu,Dahua Lin,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory framework to improve scene consistency in autoregressive video world models, addressing issues of forgetting in limited temporal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with maintaining scene consistency due to limited temporal context windows, leading to forgetting of previously generated environments.

Method: The proposed framework uses a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory to store and retrieve information, trained and evaluated on custom datasets with explicit 3D memory mechanisms.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The work advances long-term consistent world generation in video models by leveraging human memory-inspired mechanisms.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaySt3R recasts 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem, using a transformer to predict depth maps and masks from query rays, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: RaySt3R uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores from query rays, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved performance and consistency.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to address limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in medical AI, improving interpretability and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs in medical AI lack utility by ignoring intrinsic image features and suffer from performance drops and unstable explanations under perturbations.

Method: Proposes VCT and SVCT, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) and conceptual layers, fusing concept and image features, and using Denoised Diffusion Smoothing for stability.

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing stable explanations under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT meets medical field needs by balancing interpretability and faithfulness, addressing CBM limitations.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: EOC-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on dynamic changes from user interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for embodied cognition focus on static scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions. EOC-Bench fills this gap by assessing object understanding in dynamic environments.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across three temporal categories (Past, Present, Future), 11 evaluation dimensions, and 3 visual referencing types. It uses a human-in-the-loop annotation framework and a multi-scale temporal accuracy metric.

Result: The benchmark evaluates various MLLMs, highlighting their performance in dynamic object cognition.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances MLLMs' embodied object cognitive capabilities, providing a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) for autoregressive image generation, ensuring unidirectional dependencies and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers hinder autoregressive models due to bidirectional dependencies. AliTok aims to align token modeling for better efficiency.

Method: Uses a causal decoder for unidirectional dependencies, prefix tokens, and two-stage training for consistency.

Result: Achieves gFID 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), outperforming diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok enhances reconstruction and generation, offering a superior alternative to current methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, achieving high performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based VR methods improve quality but are computationally expensive. Extending one-step approaches to high-resolution VR is challenging.

Method: Proposes SeedVR2 with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, using dynamic window sizes and feature matching loss for stability.

Result: SeedVR2 matches or outperforms existing VR methods in a single step, handling high-resolution video effectively.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 offers an efficient, high-performance solution for video restoration, addressing computational and resolution challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding in images and videos by integrating segmentation and semantic generation efficiently.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver for feature transformation, and uses a refined dataset of 1.5M images and 0.6M videos.

Result: PAM runs 1.2-2.4x faster, uses less GPU memory, and performs well across region understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PAM provides a lightweight, efficient baseline for future research in region-level visual understanding.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using large pre-trained vision models.

Method: Trains an adapter to refine features using 3D-aware pseudo-labels, incorporating relaxed cyclic consistency and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints.

Result: Achieves a 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The method simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces dependency on dataset-specific annotations.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: MARBLE introduces a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling fine-grained control over material attributes like roughness and glow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space embeddings and identifying key blocks in the denoising UNet for material attribution.

Method: The approach involves finding material embeddings in CLIP-space, blending materials using exemplar images, and using a shallow network for parametric control over material attributes.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows the method's effectiveness, including multi-edit capabilities and applicability to painting.

Conclusion: MARBLE successfully enhances material editing by combining CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained models, offering fine-grained control and versatility.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for physics-integrated neural rendering require dense multi-view videos and suffer from error accumulation in sparse inputs, limiting scalability and accuracy.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties based on parameter sensitivity, avoiding sequential optimization pitfalls.

Result: ProJo4D achieves superior performance in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material parameter estimation on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets.

Conclusion: ProJo4D advances physically grounded 4D scene understanding by addressing scalability and accuracy challenges in sparse multi-view video inputs.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing them into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. It identifies performance gaps in 3D scene-centric VLMs, attributing them to limited reliance on 3D encoders and ineffective pre-training. A new QA dataset is introduced to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to other approaches and to enhance genuine 3D scene understanding.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs, conducts in-depth analysis of their limitations, and introduces a novel QA dataset to disrupt shortcut learning.

Result: 3D scene-centric VLMs over-rely on linguistic cues and underutilize 3D encoders. Data scaling benefits are limited.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and strategies are needed to improve 3D understanding in VLMs, with the new dataset serving as a step forward.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth discontinuities in depth maps cause fragmented point clouds, degrading rendering quality in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Introduces PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer to enforce geometric smoothness.

Result: Improved depth maps enhance 3DGS performance across architectures and scenes, yielding better rendering.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively mitigates depth discontinuities, improving rendering quality in 3DGS pipelines.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting

CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with

supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive

improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained

TL;DR: MINT-CoT enhances multimodal math reasoning by interleaving visual tokens into textual CoT steps, outperforming baselines on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to multimodal domains for math problem-solving is challenging due to coarse visual regions, limited vision encoder perception, and reliance on external tools.

Method: MINT-CoT introduces adaptive visual token interleaving via an Interleave Token, a dataset of 54K problems, and a three-stage training strategy (text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL).

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in

TL;DR: VideoMarathon introduces a large-scale dataset for hour-long video instruction-following, enabling training of Video-LMMs like Hour-LLaVA, which excels in long video-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of well-annotated long videos for training Video-LMMs, hindering progress in hour-long video understanding.

Method: Develop VideoMarathon, a dataset with 9,700 hours of diverse long videos and 3.3M QA pairs. Propose Hour-LLaVA, a Video-LMM with a memory augmentation module for efficient hour-long video processing.

Result: Hour-LLaVA outperforms on long video-language benchmarks, showcasing the dataset's quality and model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA advance long video-language understanding, addressing previous limitations in training and performance.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

*Ghazi Shazan Ahmad,Ahmed Heakl,Hanan Gani,Abdelrahman Shaker,Zhiqiang Shen,Ranjay Krishna,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for spatio-temporal localization, combining LLM reasoning with temporal consistency and mask fusion for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods lack contextual understanding; VideoMolmo aims to enhance spatio-temporal pointing with LLM capabilities.

Method: Uses a temporal module with attention and a novel mask fusion pipeline (SAM2) for bidirectional point propagation.

Result: Outperforms existing models in accuracy and reasoning, validated on VPoS-Bench and Refer-VOS tasks.

Conclusion: VideoMolmo advances spatio-temporal localization with interpretability and generalization, supported by a new dataset and benchmark.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline generates defurnished indoor replicas using textured meshes and multi-view panoramas, leveraging segmentation, inpainting, and geometric guidance for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create accurate defurnished indoor replicas, overcoming limitations of neural radiance fields (blurry outputs) and RGB-D inpainting (hallucinations).

Method: 1. Segment and remove furniture from meshes to create a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). 2. Extract Canny edges from SDM-rendered depth/normal images. 3. Use ControlNet inpainting on panoramas guided by edges. 4. Texture the mesh with inpainted panoramas.

Result: Produces higher-quality defurnished assets compared to neural radiance fields or RGB-D inpainting.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively combines geometric guidance and inpainting to achieve superior defurnishing results.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

### [436] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor scenes from text descriptions using LLMs, addressing challenges in layout generation with spatial reasoning and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene synthesis struggle with open-vocabulary and fine-grained user instructions due to dataset limitations and inflexible constraints.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement. It employs CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward for training and inference.

Result: DirectLayout achieves high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in generated scenes.

Conclusion: The framework advances 3D scene synthesis by combining LLMs' spatial reasoning with iterative refinement, enabling flexible and user-aligned layouts.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework, RAS, to address it by combining text and visual prompts for segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex vision-language queries, limiting their effectiveness in user-friendly applications.

Method: The proposed RAS framework enhances segmentation models with multimodal interactions using a mask-centric large multimodal model.

Result: RAS demonstrates superior performance on ORES, RES, and GRES tasks, validated by new datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ.

Conclusion: The RAS framework effectively bridges the gap in multimodal segmentation, offering improved performance and versatility for complex queries.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Jiahui Wang,Zuyan Liu,Yongming Rao,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that only a small subset of attention heads in MLLMs (termed visual heads) actively contribute to visual understanding. It introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that leverages this sparsity for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and optimize their efficiency by exploiting the sparsity of visual heads.

Method: A training-free framework identifies visual heads, followed by SparseMM, which allocates asymmetric computation budgets based on visual relevance.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance parity.

Conclusion: The sparsity of visual heads in MLLMs can be leveraged for efficient inference, with SparseMM demonstrating superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural inverse rendering system for multi-viewpoint videos of light propagation, using time-resolved neural radiance caching to handle direct and indirect light transport, achieving state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and novel capabilities like relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately modeling and reconstructing light propagation in scenes with strong indirect light, which is critical for applications like 3D reconstruction and view synthesis.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching to a time-resolved framework, enabling efficient inverse rendering by storing and retrieving infinite-bounce radiance data from multi-viewpoint videos.

Result: Achieves accurate 3D reconstruction in indirect light conditions, enables view synthesis, decomposes light into direct/indirect components, and supports time-resolved relighting.

Conclusion: The system advances neural inverse rendering by effectively handling complex light transport, offering new capabilities for scene analysis and synthesis.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeTimeGS introduces a flexible 4D representation for dynamic 3D scenes, improving motion handling and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to deformation field optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation allowing Gaussian primitives at arbitrary time/locations, with motion functions for temporal efficiency.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS offers superior flexibility and performance for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform cross-modal, temporally extended mathematical reasoning in videos, covering diverse domains and real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos requires integrating multimodal, noisy, and temporally dispersed information, which existing models struggle with.

Method: The benchmark includes 10 mathematical domains with videos of varying lengths, annotated by experts, and focuses on three reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension.

Result: The benchmark provides a systematic framework to evaluate and diagnose model capabilities in complex, real-world mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA highlights the limitations of current approaches and sets a foundation for advancing models in multimodal, temporally extended reasoning.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code

*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional flow uniqueness in diffusion models, improving training speed, efficiency, and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In conditional settings, flow uniqueness is not guaranteed, leading to ambiguous generations. This work addresses the overlap issue by enforcing uniqueness across conditional flows.

Method: Introduces Contrastive Flow Matching, adding a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Achieves up to 9x faster training, 5x fewer de-noising steps, and 8.9 lower FID compared to standard flow matching.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively improves conditional generation by ensuring flow uniqueness, validated across benchmarks.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DES is a novel adversarial training framework that dynamically adjusts perturbation budgets per instance and iteration, improving robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods use fixed perturbation budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: DES adaptively adjusts budgets using gradient-based boundary distance, softmax entropy confidence, and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty.

Result: DES outperforms fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DES introduces a data-driven, instance-aware approach to adversarial training, with theoretical stability and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

TL;DR: RSVP is a novel framework combining multimodal reasoning with visual segmentation, improving grounding and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs by integrating reasoning and segmentation.

Method: A two-stage framework: reasoning-driven localization with multimodal prompts and segmentation refinement using a Vision-Language Segmentation Module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (+6.5 gIoU, +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, 49.7 mAP on SegInW).

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates reasoning with visual understanding, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, the first benchmark for evaluating structured visual reasoning across multiple images in MLLMs, highlighting gaps in current benchmarks and demonstrating the underperformance of open-source MLLMs and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack evaluation of reasoning over multi-image inputs, leaving a gap in understanding MLLMs' capabilities in this area.

Method: The authors create MMRB, a benchmark with 92 sub-tasks for spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, using GPT-4o and human experts for annotations. They also propose a sentence-level matching framework for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 40 MLLMs show open-source models lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and reward models struggle with multi-image ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a critical gap in evaluating multi-image reasoning, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and reward models.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges like realism, diversity, and control by combining image diffusion models, transformer-based mapping, and point-cloud diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, diverse, and controllable 3D human generation from text prompts, overcoming limitations in current methods.

Method: A three-step pipeline: (1) generate photorealistic human images with controllable attributes, (2) map image features to 3D point clouds using transformers, (3) train a point-cloud diffusion model conditioned on text prompts.

Result: Significant speed-ups in generation, improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline advances 3D human generation by addressing key challenges, with plans to release code and dataset.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

*Ankit Pal,Jung-Oh Lee,Xiaoman Zhang,Malaikannan Sankarasubbu,Seunghyeon Roh,Won Jung Kim,Meesun Lee,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA is a large benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, introducing diverse clinical tasks and evaluating AI models, with MedGemma outperforming human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI in radiological reasoning, bridging the gap between AI and clinical expertise.

Method: Developed ReXVQA with 696K questions and 160K X-rays, tested eight models, and conducted a human reader study.

Result: MedGemma achieved 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human readers (77.27%).

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI evaluation, enabling next-gen systems with expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

### [449] [WorldPrediction: A Benchmark for High-level World Modeling and Long-horizon Procedural Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363)
*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating AI models' world modeling and procedural planning capabilities, highlighting their current limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear ability of current AI models, especially generative ones, to learn world models and perform procedural planning in diverse environments.

Method: Developed WorldPrediction, a discriminative benchmark with tasks (WorldPrediction-WM and WorldPrediction-PP) requiring models to distinguish proper actions or sequences from counterfactual distractors, using visual observations and action equivalents to avoid low-level cues.

Result: Current top models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, while humans perform perfectly.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant gaps in AI models' world modeling and planning abilities, emphasizing the need for further research.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a contextual cue-based method for puck detection in hockey videos, outperforming prior methods by 12.2% in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Puck detection is challenging due to small size, occlusions, and motion blur. Players' behavior (orientation/gaze) provides strong contextual cues.

Method: PLUCC combines a contextual encoder (player orientations), feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC improves average precision by 12.2% and RSLE by 25% over baselines.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly enhances puck detection, benefiting automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

### [451] [Fine-Tuning Video Transformers for Word-Level Bangla Sign Language: A Comparative Analysis for Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04367)
*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401) for sign language recognition, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired in Bangladesh by automating BdSL recognition using advanced video transformers.

Method: Fine-tuning VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer on BdSL datasets; applying data augmentation and 10-fold cross-validation; benchmarking on public datasets.

Result: VideoMAE achieved 95.5% accuracy on BdSLW60 and 81.04% on BdSLW401, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Video transformers are highly effective for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition, with performance influenced by dataset and model factors.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

### [452] [Visualizing and Controlling Cortical Responses Using Voxel-Weighted Activation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04379)
*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization in DNN-based encoding models predicts and modulates human brain responses to visual stimuli, revealing feature selectivity across the visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited interpretability of DNN-based encoding models in understanding specific features driving brain responses.

Method: Uses activation maximization on a pretrained Inception V3 network, adaptively downsamples activations, and applies linear regression to predict fMRI responses. Generates images optimized for voxel-specific brain responses.

Result: Generated images align with known selectivity and reliably drive activity in targeted brain regions, validated by fMRI studies.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully characterizes and modulates responses in the human visual system, overcoming limitations of generative models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

### [453] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully prevent diffusion-based editing, often yielding desirable outputs instead of noisy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse of diffusion models for misinformation and copyright infringement by evaluating the effectiveness of perturbation-based image protection.

Method: Experiments with various perturbation-based protection methods across domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image, style editing).

Result: Perturbation-based protection often fails, as diffusion-based editing still produces desirable outputs adhering to prompts. Noise may even enhance text-prompt association.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing, potentially worsening outcomes.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [454] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes filter normalization for deep learning filters to address distortions in responses due to atmospheric transfer, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical image filters are normalized for consistency, but deep learning filters lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses and incorrect outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce filter normalization with learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: The method improves performance on intensity variation benchmarks, with ResNet34 outperforming CLIP. Filter normalization enhances robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves model robustness and generalization, bridging classical filtering principles with deep learning.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

### [455] [HMAR: Efficient Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04421)
*Hermann Kumbong,Xian Liu,Tsung-Yi Lin,Ming-Yu Liu,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu,Daniel Y. Fu,Christopher Ré,David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves image generation by introducing hierarchical masked autoregressive modeling, addressing VAR's issues with quality, sequence length, and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of VAR, such as reduced image quality, superlinear sequence length scaling, and inflexible sampling schedules.

Method: HMAR uses next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and a multi-step masked generation procedure for controllable token prediction.

Result: HMAR matches or outperforms VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive models on ImageNet benchmarks, with faster training/inference and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: HMAR offers superior performance, flexibility, and efficiency compared to VAR, enabling zero-shot image editing and adaptable sampling schedules.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing VIBA for precise rolling-shutter camera calibration and a physical image formation model to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often overlook details like precise camera timestamps and sensor characteristics, leading to less accurate reconstructions.

Method: The study uses visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Experiments show consistent visual improvements (+1 dB PSNR with VIBA, +1 dB with the image formation model) on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance photorealistic reconstruction accuracy by addressing rolling-shutter effects and sensor dynamics, validated across diverse conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization to improve pose-invariant face recognition, showing better results than frontalization on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical techniques like face frontalization, often tested on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment training data for a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization outperforms non-defrontalized models and state-of-the-art frontalization on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP), but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses.

Conclusion: Defrontalization is effective for larger datasets, suggesting current methods may overfit to small datasets like Multi-PIE.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method that achieves SOTA accuracy and fast inference, optimized for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are inefficient for resource-constrained devices due to irregular memory access and high computational costs.

Method: FALO arranges voxels into a 1D sequence and processes them with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers) and implicit grouping for efficiency.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster on mobile GPUs/NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO is a practical solution for efficient and accurate LiDAR 3D detection on edge devices.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by integrating language guidance and uncertainty learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to novel forgeries due to reliance on statistical artifacts tied to specific generation processes.

Method: Combines discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, using MLLMs for text generation, and integrates data uncertainty learning.

Result: Achieves significant AUC gains (6.15% on DFDC, 16.68% on DF40) and improves reasoning performance by 24.69% on DDVQA.

Conclusion: AuthGuard enhances generalization and interpretability in deepfake detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [460] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pruning method that simultaneously removes neurons and layers in deep learning models, achieving high sparsity while maintaining accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are computationally expensive and complex, especially for resource-constrained applications. Existing pruning methods focus on either neurons or layers, but not both, leaving room for improvement.

Method: The proposed method selects the best pruned subnetwork (from layer or neuron pruning) by measuring representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment. This process is iterated to create highly sparse models.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques, achieving significant FLOPs reduction (e.g., 86.37% for ResNet56) with minimal accuracy loss. It also enhances robustness and reduces carbon emissions by up to 83.31%.

Conclusion: The work advances pruning by enabling simultaneous neuron and layer removal, offering a scalable solution for efficient deep learning models and contributing to GreenAI.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

*Shuo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EECD-Net is a multi-stage road crack detection method using SRCNN, SCU, and GAT modules, achieving 98.6% accuracy and 33% energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of low-quality images and high energy consumption in smart terminal devices for real-time road crack monitoring.

Method: Combines SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU for energy efficiency, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% accuracy on CrackVision12K, with 5.6 mJ energy consumption (33% reduction).

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR), which directly enhances image frequency components, reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on indirect enhancements like specialized loss functions. The authors aim to directly improve image frequency components for better efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes LSKs, rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal one-dimensional kernels, to enhance frequency components. Includes interpretable analysis and visualization of feature maps.

Result: LSKs reduce parameters and computation by over 60%, improve model performance, and excel with higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: LSKs offer a lightweight, effective solution for SISR, balancing efficiency and performance, especially for larger upscaling factors.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACRO enhances multi-modal reasoning by aligning visual captioning with reasoning objectives via reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking language models to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to high retraining costs for vision-language alignment. Decoupling perception from reasoning introduces the need for faithful and informative visual descriptions.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reinforcement learning strategy that optimizes caption rewards to align visual extraction with reasoning objectives, closing the perception-reasoning loop.

Result: RACRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal benchmarks, improving visual grounding and enabling scalable, plug-and-play adaptation to advanced reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: RACRO effectively addresses the challenge of multi-modal reasoning by optimizing visual descriptions for reasoning, offering scalability and avoiding costly retraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

*Biao Guo,Fangmin Guo,Guibo Luo,Xiaonan Luo,Feng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGM-Pose, a lightweight single-branch network, improves multi-person pose estimation by integrating global context and multi-scale information, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-based methods lack global context and suffer from high latency due to complex structures.

Method: Uses MobileViM Block with LARM for global info and SFusion for multi-scale integration.

Result: Reduces parameters, achieves better performance, and faster speeds on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose offers an efficient solution for lightweight pose estimation with global modeling.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video, using video inpainting and iterative training for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible 4D video creation and editing from a single monocular video, leveraging existing video inpainting models for robust results.

Method: Reformulates 4D video creation as inpainting, using composite masks for training, iterative tuning for consistency, and a temporal packaging module for quality.

Result: Generates high-quality 4D videos with multi-view coherence and supports prompt-based editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines inpainting and iterative training for versatile 4D video generation and editing.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

*Ziqi Jia,Anmin Wang,Xiaoyang Qu,Xiaowen Yang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning (HEC) and Task-aware MoILE to address high-level planning and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for embodied agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning setups for embodied agents lack high-level planning and multi-level knowledge, leading to limitations in task execution.

Method: HEC divides learning into high-level instructions and low-level actions. Task-aware MoILE uses clustering and dual routers (task-level and token-level) to select LoRA experts, with SVD to mitigate forgetting.

Result: The method outperforms others in reducing catastrophic forgetting, enabling agents to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: HEC and Task-aware MoILE effectively address hierarchical learning and forgetting, enhancing continual learning for embodied agents.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating customizable, animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text prompts using vision-language models and iterative AI-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating VLMs and parametric human generators.

Method: Leverages VLMs and parametric generators, with an autonomous verification loop for iterative refinement of avatars based on facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment.

Result: Outperforms other systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, suitable for consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, interactive solution for high-quality, customizable avatar generation.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework, Perfecting Depth, enhances sensor depth by combining stochastic uncertainty modeling and deterministic refinement for reliable, artifact-free depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable depth regions in sensor data while preserving geometric cues for applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Uses a stochastic estimation stage to detect unreliable regions and infer structure, followed by deterministic refinement for consistency and accuracy.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: Sets a new baseline for depth enhancement, with potential for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

TL;DR: A survey on how deep learning has transformed traditional image matching pipelines, covering learnable replacements and end-to-end modules, with benchmarks and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, prompting the need for deep learning advancements to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: The survey reviews learnable replacements for traditional pipeline steps (detector-descriptor, outlier filter, geometric estimator) and end-to-end modules (sparse/dense matcher, pose regressor).

Result: Benchmarks on pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning-driven methods.

Conclusion: The survey provides a clear overview of deep learning's impact on image matching and identifies key challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, showing models struggle with complex visual simulations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation essential for spatial cognition.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks covering geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world challenges.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex ones like 3D cube folding, while humans excel with visual simulations.

Conclusion: Models lack effective use of intermediate visual information, highlighting a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for image super-resolution often distort text structures, necessitating a solution to recover both natural details and text fidelity.

Method: TADiSR integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders, along with a pipeline for synthesizing high-quality images with text masks.

Result: The approach enhances text legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance and strong real-world generalization.

Conclusion: TADiSR effectively addresses text distortion in super-resolution, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity for efficient video generation, achieving significant speedups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: Introduces FPSAttention, a joint optimization of FP8 quantization and sparsity with 3D tile-wise granularity, denoising step-aware strategy, and hardware-friendly kernels.

Result: Achieves 7.09x kernel speedup for attention and 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation at 720p.

Conclusion: FPSAttention enables efficient, high-quality video generation by co-designing quantization and sparsity.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to apply group decomposition theory in representation learning for realistic scenarios by combining feature extraction and object segmentation, validated on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional representation learning, which fails to account for conditional independence, and to enable real-world application of group decomposition theory.

Method: Combines feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: Validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and background, showing promise for realistic applications.

Conclusion: The method advances understanding of human object recognition development and improves representation learning for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

*Zhong Ji,Rongshuai Wei,Jingren Liu,Yanwei Pang,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework to improve interpretability and performance of Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) in data-scarce settings, achieving notable gains in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEMs struggle in low-data regimes due to parametric imbalance and representation misalignment, limiting their interpretability and performance.

Method: The FSPCC framework uses a Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module concept guidance, multi-level feature preservation, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification, outperforming existing SEMs.

Conclusion: Coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation enhances accuracy and interpretability, advancing transparent visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks by improving synthetic data generation.

Method: Leverages Layer Diffusion, LLMs, and VLLMs to create single-object masks and diverse backgrounds, with validation and prompt optimization.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances synthetic data quality and model performance in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Chuyun Deng,Na Liu,Wei Xie,Lianming Xu,Li Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS, a multi-scale aware radiomap super-resolution method, combines CNNs and Transformers to improve radio map reconstruction accuracy from sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate radio maps are crucial for smart cities and IoT, but existing methods lack environmental awareness or rely on detailed scene data, limiting generalization.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance global and local feature extraction.

Result: MARS outperforms baseline models in MSE and SSIM across various scenes and antenna locations while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for radio map reconstruction, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

*Youngwan Lee,Kangsan Kim,Kwanyong Park,Ilcahe Jung,Soojin Jang,Seanie Lee,Yong-Ju Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements, addressing gaps in current safety-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety-tuning approaches for VLMs are limited in coverage and rely heavily on data-centric methods, leaving models vulnerable to unseen harmful configurations.

Method: The authors propose HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a safety meta token and safety head for intrinsic safety improvements.

Result: SafeLLaVA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA advance robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging further research in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores how multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images in hidden activations, finding linearly decodable ImageNet class features and demonstrating their causality through targeted edits. It also trains Sparse Autoencoders to enhance feature diversity and observes increasing modality sharing in deeper layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how multimodal models internally represent visual inputs and the interplay between text and image features.

Method: Analyzes LlaVA-Next's hidden activations for ImageNet class representations, performs causal edits, and trains multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to study feature diversity and modality sharing.

Result: Identifies linearly decodable and causal image features, creates an interpretable feature dictionary, and observes deeper-layer modality sharing.

Conclusion: Multimodal models exhibit disjoint but increasingly shared representations across modalities in deeper layers, with interpretable features emerging from linear decoding and SAEs.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

### [479] [Robust Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04713)
*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRAPF, a method for robust few-shot adaptation of pretrained VLMs, balancing ID and OOD accuracy by combining retrieval augmentation and adversarial perturbation in a two-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation is critical as models often encounter OOD test data.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, identifies top-layer visual encoder finetuning as optimal, and introduces SRAPF with retrieval augmentation and adversarial perturbation.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with augmentation techniques (retrieval and adversarial) in stages (SRAPF) effectively balances ID and OOD performance.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

*Zelu Qi,Ping Shi,Chaoyang Zhang,Shuqi Wang,Fei Zhao,Da Pan,Zefeng Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for assessing AI-generated video (AIGV) quality using a multi-dimensional approach and a large language model (LLM) for regression, achieving second place in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGVs often have visual defects (noise, blur, etc.) that degrade user experience, necessitating an automatic quality assessment method for regulation and model improvement.

Method: Decomposes AIGV quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, uses encoders for feature representation, and employs an LLM with multi-modal prompts and LoRA fine-tuning for quality regression.

Result: The method secured second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment Challenge for AI-generated video.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively assesses AIGV quality, leveraging LLMs and multi-dimensional features, proving its practical utility.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,

*Hongyu Wang,Yonghao Long,Yueyao Chen,Hon-Chi Yip,Markus Scheppach,Philip Wai-Yan Chiu,Yeung Yam,Helen Mei-Ling Meng,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training but remains underexplored, with challenges in handling uncertainty and geometric symmetries.

Method: iDPOE uses a diffusion model and equivariant representations to model expert behavior, enabling robust learning and generalization.

Result: Experiments on 2000 ESD clips show iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, offering significant improvements.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel
defect detection that leverages in-context learning capabilities. We adopt and
enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline
the labeling process. Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial
display panel datasets, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline
model, achieving an average IoU increase of 0.22 and a 14% improvement in
recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60%
auto-labeling coverage. Experimental results show that models trained on our

offering a practical solution for reducing manual annotation efforts in
industrial inspection systems.

*Mikhail Kennerley,Angelica Alives-Reviro,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, improving detection performance without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining datasets for better generalization is challenging due to inconsistent class semantics and bounding box annotations. Existing methods either assume shared taxonomies or require manual effort.

Method: LAT uses dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, combines them with ground-truth via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines features with a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: LAT improves target-domain detection performance by up to +4.8AP over baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively addresses class and spatial inconsistencies without manual intervention or shared label spaces.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses backdoor attacks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) to mitigate such attacks without trigger knowledge, reducing success rates to 5.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks, causing malicious captions. Existing defenses struggle due to the attacks' cross-modal nature and imperceptibility.

Method: SRD uses reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Network) to apply discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions, guided by a semantic fidelity score.

Result: SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs (<10% performance drop).

Conclusion: SRD provides an effective, trigger-agnostic defense against backdoor attacks in VLMs, balancing robustness and caption fidelity.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater images by combining physical constraints with advanced feature learning, ensuring both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach: one stream estimates transmission maps and background light via a physics estimator, while another learns features via capsule clustering.

Result: Achieves +0.5dB PSNR over best methods with one-third FLOPs, or +1dB PSNR with similar FLOPs.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances physical adherence, perceptual quality, and computational efficiency for underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for extensive training data in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by identifying high-value 'cognitive samples' that trigger meaningful reasoning. It introduces Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), a data selection paradigm using two estimators (CDE and ACE) and a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to optimize training efficiency. RAP achieves superior performance with only 9.3% of data, reducing computational costs by 43%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address data redundancy and high computational costs in training MLLMs by proving that smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning.

Method: The method involves RAP, which identifies cognitive samples using CDE (to eliminate language-prior-dependent samples) and ACE (to discard irrelevant tokens). DRM replaces trivial instances with challenging ones.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show RAP achieves better performance with only 9.3% of training data and reduces computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that RAP effectively improves multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs by focusing on high-value samples, reducing data and computational requirements.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified SSIM loss function for unsupervised monocular depth learning, improving gradient smoothness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use SSIM and MAE but overlook the impact of SSIM components and hyperparameters on training.

Method: The new SSIM form replaces multiplication with addition for combining luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components.

Result: The optimized SSIM loss outperforms the baseline on KITTI-2015, achieving smoother gradients and better depth estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed SSIM modification enhances unsupervised depth learning performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

TL;DR: HypeVPR is a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures to improve accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diverse query images in real-world VPR applications require a perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) approach, which HypeVPR addresses by exploiting hierarchical structures in panoramic views.

Method: HypeVPR uses hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for efficient matching.

Result: HypeVPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: HypeVPR effectively addresses P2E VPR challenges by combining hierarchical embeddings and efficient search, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D representation framework that encodes rich object embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, outperforming specialized methods in accuracy and storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they are task-specific and cannot decode embeddings into explicit geometry or reuse them across tasks. Object-X aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them with object attributes into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and performs competitively in scene alignment and localization while requiring minimal storage.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable, practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, excelling in both reconstruction quality and task versatility.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results by precomputing a cutoff table and greedily removing redundant vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, but some applications require diversity in search results.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors and greedily filter redundant candidates during post-processing.

Result: Operates fast (0.02 ms/query) in real-world RAG settings using OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results efficiently, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

*Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline improving robustness in geometric model estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust estimation in computer vision is challenging due to varying performance of RANSAC variants; SupeRANSAC aims for consistent accuracy across tasks.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, analyzing techniques for effective RANSAC performance in tasks like homography and pose estimation.

Result: Improves accuracy, e.g., 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple vision tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset for mega-category Chinese character recognition, addressing gaps in existing datasets and enabling new research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate recognition of a vast number of Chinese characters for cultural preservation and digital applications, despite the lack of comprehensive datasets.

Method: Creation of MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, supporting the latest GB18030-2022 standard and addressing long-tail distribution with balanced subsets (handwritten, historical, synthetic).

Result: The dataset provides six times more categories than existing ones, reveals new challenges (storage, similar characters, zero-shot learning), and offers research opportunities.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, likely the largest in OCR and pattern recognition, fostering future advancements.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Spike-TBR is a novel event-based encoding method combining Temporal Binary Representation (TBR) with spiking neurons to enhance noise resilience and compatibility with standard vision pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras outperform traditional sensors in temporal resolution and dynamic range, but converting noisy event streams into usable formats remains challenging.

Method: Spike-TBR integrates spiking neurons into TBR to filter noise, creating robust event stream representations. Four variants with different spiking neurons are tested.

Result: Spike-TBR shows superior performance in noisy scenarios and improves results on clean data across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method bridges spike-based and frame-based processing, providing a noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates adversarial attacks on traffic light detectors using printed patches, showing successful label-flipping and classification attacks in lab and real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicle perception tasks have largely ignored traffic light detectors, creating a gap this work addresses.

Method: The authors propose a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and a training strategy for CNNs, conducting experiments in both lab and real-world scenarios.

Result: Successful targeted attacks (e.g., red-to-green label flipping) and pictogram classification attacks were achieved, validated with printed patches in real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in traffic light detectors and provides a practical framework for adversarial attacks, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in VSR due to tokenization and sequential attention, while existing solutions face limited receptive fields and optical flow inaccuracies.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR tasks.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR offers a simplified, effective solution for real-world VSR by addressing limitations of existing transformer-based models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception systems excel in 2D reasoning segmentation but lack comparable frameworks for 3D tasks, relying on explicit instructions or pre-defined categories.

Method: Introduces OpenMaskDINO3D with a SEG token and object identifier to process point cloud data and text prompts for accurate 3D segmentation.

Result: Achieves high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation, validated on large-scale ScanNet datasets.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D effectively bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation, enabling accurate results from natural language instructions.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reconstruction of geological fields from sparse observations by leveraging tensor completion techniques.

Method: Model the field as a multidimensional tensor and enforce a global low-rank structure, combining tensor completion and geostatistics.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements over ordinary kriging for varying data observation percentages.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor completion method is effective for geological field reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a new viewpoint on a reconstructing multidimensional geological

geostatistics, providing a robust optimization framework. Experiments on
synthetic geological fields demonstrate that used tensor completion method
significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy over ordinary kriging for

*Yu-Feng Chen,Tzuhsuan Huang,Pin-Yen Chiu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack framework for diffusion models in image editing, using invisible triggers via poisoned training data and deep watermarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in diffusion models focus on image generation, leaving image editing vulnerable, especially with impractical visible triggers.

Method: The method embeds invisible triggers using deep watermarking models, ensuring normal editing for clean images while manipulating watermarked inputs.

Result: The framework achieves high attack success rates across various watermarking models, with analysis confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the feasibility of invisible backdoor attacks in image editing, supported by empirical results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer encoder trained with supervised contrastive learning to model human-like intuition in chess, achieving high performance without deep search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human intuition-driven planning and modern chess engines' deep search methods.

Method: Train a transformer encoder using supervised contrastive learning to embed chess board states into a structured latent space, enabling move selection via evaluative similarity.

Result: Achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, showing performance scales with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to traditional deep search, generalizable to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anywhere3D-Bench, a benchmark for 3D visual grounding beyond objects, revealing challenges in space-level and part-level tasks for current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark 3D visual grounding beyond object-level semantics, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Method: Developed Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs across four grounding levels, evaluated using state-of-the-art models, LLMs, and MLLMs.

Result: Space-level and part-level tasks are the most challenging, with the best model (OpenAI o4-mini) achieving only 23.57% and 33.94% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception for 3D scenes beyond object-level tasks, highlighting a critical research gap.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation is proposed, outperforming NeRF-based methods. Expert knowledge transfer from FoundationStereo improves zero-shot generalization, while direct 3DGS geometry is noisy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient, high-fidelity alternative to NeRF-based stereo dataset generation and improve zero-shot generalization for deep stereo models.

Method: Utilizes 3DGS for dataset generation and combines it with depth estimates from FoundationStereo in a knowledge transfer setup. Fine-tunes stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets.

Result: 3DGS-generated datasets with FoundationStereo disparity estimates yield cleaner results and better zero-shot performance compared to noisy direct 3DGS geometry.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning, but robustness in challenging settings needs further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of selecting appropriate 3D digitization methods for heritage objects, emphasizing that no single method fits all cases and advocating for collaborative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitization of heritage objects is widely accepted, but the diversity of objects requires tailored methods. The paper aims to highlight the need for adaptable and collaborative approaches in 3D digitization.

Method: The study uses objects from the musée d'Archéologie nationale to illustrate the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods and the necessity of adapting tools for each object.

Result: The findings show that no single digitization method is universally suitable; the choice depends on the object's characteristics and the intended use of its digital twin.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that absolute classification of 3D digitization methods is impractical. Instead, the focus should be on selecting the best-suited digital tool for each object through collaboration between heritage and digital experts.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Motivation: To address the lack of open-access datasets for individual lynx identification and related tasks, enabling benchmarking and method development.

Method: Combines real camera trap images (30k) with synthetic images (100k) generated via Unity and diffusion modeling, annotated with masks, labels, and skeletons.

Result: Covers 219 unique lynx individuals across 15 years, with three evaluation protocols for spatial and temporal generalization.

Conclusion: CzechLynx is a valuable resource for advancing models in animal re-identification and related tasks.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods for embryo selection in IVF are limited by partial evaluation or confounding factors, reducing clinical utility.

Method: Proposes CoSTeM, a framework with morphological and morphokinetic branches to integrate static and dynamic features for grading.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in predicting embryo quality.

Conclusion: Provides a methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection, with plans to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, undermining trust. Current defenses focus on data-driven methods, but the paper questions if robustness should be designed into the model's architecture instead.

Method: The approach enforces orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, supplemented by pruning and fine-tuning, to create an inherently robust IQA model.

Result: The proposed architecture resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major modifications to the original model.

Conclusion: The work advocates a paradigm shift from data-driven robustness optimization to engineering robustness through architectural design.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long videos due to inefficiency and computational constraints.

Method: APVR uses Pivot Frame Retrieval and Pivot Token Retrieval for hierarchical, query-aware information extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and VideoMME, surpassing both training-free and training-based methods.

Conclusion: APVR efficiently handles long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity and integrates seamlessly with existing models.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

*Huihan Wang,Zhiwen Yang,Hui Zhang,Dan Zhao,Bingzheng Wei,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT is a Transformer-based model for dynamic medical video synthesis, addressing spatial-temporal-channel dependencies with efficient attention mechanisms and fine-grained guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for medical video synthesis suffer from insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity, and coarse denoising guidance.

Method: FEAT introduces sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity attention designs, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S matches or outperforms Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L surpasses all competitors in performance and scalability.

Conclusion: FEAT offers an efficient and effective solution for high-quality dynamic medical video synthesis, with superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using SAM and DSM for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, finding BalSAM (with DSM) promising but noting SAM alone underperforms Mask R-CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tree monitoring is costly and labor-intensive; drone-based methods with SAM and DSM offer scalable alternatives.

Method: Compare SAM-based approaches for tree crown segmentation in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, integrating DSM data. BalSAM combines SAM and DSM.

Result: BalSAM shows potential, especially in plantations, but SAM alone underperforms Mask R-CNN. DSM integration improves results.

Conclusion: Efficient SAM tuning and DSM integration are promising for tree crown segmentation, though SAM alone isn't superior to Mask R-CNN.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

*Yangyang Zhong,Ji Qi,Yuan Yao,Pengxin Luo,Yunfeng Yan,Donglian Qi,Zhiyuan Liu,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations of existing datasets. It proposes a three-stage evaluation framework and an efficient paradigm to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) are limited by short video durations and narrow evaluation scopes, failing to assess multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adequately.

Method: 1) Introduces TextVidBench with cross-domain long-video coverage and fine-grained annotations. 2) Proposes a three-stage evaluation framework. 3) Enhances models via IT-Rope mechanism, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed method improves long-video scene text understanding.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills a gap in long-video evaluation, and the proposed enhancements offer insights for advancing MLLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

*Enrique Sanchez,Isma Hadji,Adrian Bulat,Christos Tzelepis,Brais Martinez,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of existing methods with hierarchical tokenization and preference-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAR-based ISR methods like VARSR are limited by fixed resolution constraints, reliance on large models, and external datasets. The paper aims to overcome these issues.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) Hierarchical Image Tokenization for multi-scale representation, and 2) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to encourage HR tokenization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art ISR results with a smaller model (300M params) and no external data, enabling denoising and super-resolution in a single pass.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses VARSR's limitations, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness in ISR tasks.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a novel temporal sampling method for sports skill assessment, preserving movement continuity and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill assessment. PATS addresses this by preserving full movement execution.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to include complete fundamental movements, repeating across segments for comprehensive coverage.

Result: PATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+0.65% to +3.05% accuracy) and excels in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering).

Conclusion: PATS is an effective adaptive approach for temporal sampling, advancing automated skill assessment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

*Gengluo Li,Huawen Shen,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark (DL-CSVTR) and a model (CSTR-CLIP) for Chinese scene text retrieval, addressing layout diversity and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese scene text retrieval is challenging due to complex layouts, and current English-focused solutions underperform.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, integrating global visual info and multi-granularity alignment training in a two-stage process.

Result: CSTR-CLIP improves accuracy by 18.82% and offers faster inference, excelling in diverse layouts.

Conclusion: The model and benchmark advance Chinese text retrieval, with public release to aid future research.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning, addressing challenges like domain generalization and metric depth accuracy.

Method: Methods include multi-scale fusion networks, reinterpreting regression as classification, incorporating priors, and using affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows leading performance in zero-shot depth estimation, excelling in structural detail but struggling with metric depth accuracy.

Conclusion: Despite progress, challenges remain in generalizing to unseen domains and achieving accurate metric depth, with Depth Anything being a notable recent advancement.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates realistic synthetic 3D point cloud data for training segmentation models, achieving high accuracy without real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud annotation is costly and labor-intensive, prompting the need for synthetic alternatives.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields to create synthetic 3D assets, simulated LiDAR for point clouds, and trains models like PointNet++, PTv3, and OACNN.

Result: PTv3 achieved 91.35% mIoU without real data, sometimes outperforming models trained on real data. Models generalized to unseen mesh models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can effectively replace real-world data for training 3D segmentation models, offering flexibility and cost savings.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians, addressing challenges like monocular setup and top-down perspective. It combines 3D foundation and human mesh models, resolves scale ambiguity, and uses Gaussian splats for rendering, outperforming existing methods in novel view synthesis.

Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios due to monocular setups, top-down perspectives, and multiple small, moving humans, which lack representation in current datasets.

Method: UAV4D integrates a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction to reconstruct scenes and humans. It resolves scale ambiguity via human-scene contact points and uses SMPL and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: Tested on VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action datasets, UAV4D achieves a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness over existing methods.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges, enabling high-quality dynamic scene rendering from monocular video without additional sensors.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to ML training and prevent loss of valuable samples.

Method: Uses calibrated, tracked pointers to record physical trajectories and contours, transforming them into standardized annotations. Includes a projector-based interface for visual guidance.

Result: Preliminary results confirm feasibility, showing accurate annotation capture and streamlined workflow with CVAT for ML tasks.

Conclusion: The system enhances ML data generation for optical inspection, offering a more intuitive and efficient annotation method.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is an inversion-free video editing framework using ODEs and attention-guided masking for coherent, localized edits, outperforming inversion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity in inversion-based video editing methods.

Method: Models editing as a direct evolution in data space via ODEs, uses attention-guided masking for localized edits, and employs guidance-enhanced editing for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector sets a new paradigm for efficient, coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real image editing by enhancing edit instruction adherence and content preservation, scaling data curation, and integrating VLM with diffusion models.

Method: Developed an enhanced data curation pipeline with meta-info embedding and a joint learning pipeline combining diffusion and reward losses.

Result: Achieved a usability rate of 56.1%, outperforming previous versions (SeedEdit 1.6, GPT4o, Gemini 2.0).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 offers a superior trade-off in real image editing, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real

present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data

### [520] [Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision transformers and language models to assess streetscapes objectively and subjectively, validated with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current objective street metrics fail to capture subjective perceptions crucial for inclusive urban design, necessitating a more holistic approach.

Method: MSEF integrates VisualGLM-6B (vision transformer) and GPT-4 (language model), fine-tuned with LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.84 for objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, revealing context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data and socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing vDiT-based video generation, achieving significant speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs hinder practical deployment, and existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a token selection mechanism and sparse attention strategy, combined with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU (13.2x on 8 GPUs) with <0.5% loss in video quality.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA provides a scalable and efficient solution for accelerating vDiT-based video generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

### [523] [DIMCIM: A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Default-mode Diversity and Generalization in Text-to-Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05108)
*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework to measure diversity in text-to-image models, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diversity evaluation methods for text-to-image models lack adaptability and interpretability, often requiring reference datasets or being vague about diversity types.

Method: The authors propose the DIM-CIM framework, which measures default-mode diversity and generalization capacity, and create the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Larger models (1.5B to 8.1B parameters) improve generalization but reduce default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM identifies fine-grained failure cases and correlates training data diversity (0.85) with model diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible, interpretable tool for evaluating text-to-image model diversity and generalization, enhancing performance understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

### [524] [Practical Manipulation Model for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05119)
*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions, enhancing robustness and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly under non-ideal conditions and are easily circumvented, prompting the need for a more robust model.

Method: The PMM expands the space of pseudo-fakes using Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors, while adding strong degradations to training images.

Result: The model shows significant improvements, with AUC increases of 3.51% on DFDC and 6.21% on DFDCP datasets over the state-of-the-art LAA backbone.

Conclusion: The PMM enhances detector robustness and performance, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Olha Khomyn,Gabriel Roccabruna,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET is a framework for systematically evaluating VLMs' understanding of object properties and relations, revealing limitations in their accuracy and human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate VLMs' comprehension of scene structure and semantics, which remains understudied despite their competitive performance in various tasks.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a framework for controlled and interpretable evaluation of VLMs using stimuli free from biases and noise. Evaluates five state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: VLMs recognize only basic object properties, depend on object position, and struggle with relations. They fall short of human-level accuracy.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in understanding scenes, highlighting the need for further research to bridge the gap with human performance.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB cameras struggle with fast-moving drones, especially in poor lighting. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but lack drone-specific benchmarks.

Method: The authors created FRED, featuring 7+ hours of annotated drone trajectories from 5 models, including challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides dense annotations, evaluation protocols, and metrics for reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural-network-free method for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, using template matching and topological similarity for improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to revisit traditional template-matching methods, which offer strong physical interpretability, instead of relying on neural networks for TWR HAR.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, segments micro-Doppler signatures using active contour models, discretizes features into point clouds, and calculates topological similarity with templates using the Mapper algorithm.

Result: The method is validated through numerical simulations and measured experiments, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves TWR HAR without neural networks, emphasizing interpretability and theoretical signal processing foundations.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

TL;DR: TAO is a new framework for fine-grained video anomaly detection, integrating pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects for precise localization without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting their ability to detect diverse anomalies.

Method: TAO introduces a granular pipeline, transforming anomaly detection into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects and linking scores to segmentation/tracking tasks.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness, setting new benchmarks in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: TAO advances VAD by unifying fine-grained anomaly detection and eliminating the need for threshold tuning.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

TL;DR: TAPFM is a novel method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) to clinical tasks using vision transformer attention and multiple instance learning (MIL), outperforming benchmarks on mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels and the need for MIL. TAPFM addresses this by optimizing feature representations and attention weights.

Method: TAPFM uses vision transformer attention for MIL aggregation, maintaining separate computational graphs for stable training dynamics during end-to-end adaptation.

Result: TAPFM outperforms conventional methods in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, handling multi-label classification effectively.

Conclusion: TAPFM enables practical adaptation of PFMs for clinical applications on standard hardware.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

TL;DR: MokA is a multimodal-aware fine-tuning strategy addressing limitations in current methods by focusing on unimodal and cross-modal adaptation, showing consistent improvements across diverse multimodal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficient multimodal fine-tuning methods often neglect intrinsic differences in multimodal scenarios, limiting full modality utilization.

Method: Proposes Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), which compresses unimodal information via modality-specific parameters and enhances cross-modal interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements across various multimodal scenarios and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, enabling further exploration in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

TL;DR: A vision-aided autonomous reflector system enhances mmWave communication in NLoS conditions by dynamically steering signals using a motorized metallic plate, achieving a 23 dB gain in signal strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS conditions is challenging, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments.

Method: The system uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on nodes, estimates angles of arrival, and aligns a reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Experimental results show a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and a 0.89 probability of maintaining reception above -65 dB in indoor tests.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing a gap in information transfer between modalities and proposing a baseline method to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization, especially in multimodal settings, for both sensitive data concerns and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Uses a synthetic persona dataset to quantify memorization and transferability, training models on one modality and testing on another.

Result: Facts transfer between modalities, but a significant gap exists in recall accuracy. This gap persists across scenarios like model capability and unlearning.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in cross-modal transferability and suggests future research for more robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models and finds detection models outperform grounding models. It proposes DEGround, a framework integrating detection and grounding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether embodied 3D grounding sufficiently benefits from detection models and to improve grounding performance by integrating detection and grounding tasks.

Method: Proposes DEGround, a framework using DETR queries for both detection and grounding, with added modules for regional activation and query-wise modulation to enhance language understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms BIP3D by 7.52% in overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: Detection models alone can outperform grounding models, and integrating detection with grounding (DEGround) significantly improves performance, highlighting the need for better context-aware grounding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat introduces an open Gaussian growing method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, leveraging semantic priors for consistent and plausible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods (dense view requirements, high computational costs, and poor generalization outside input views) for applications like virtual reality and embodied AI.

Method: Uses open Gaussians initialized from sparse views, an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module, and bidirectional control between diffusion models for progressive Gaussian parameter optimization.

Result: Demonstrates promising semantic-aware reconstruction capabilities, validated by a new Gaussian Outpainting benchmark and real-world smartphone images.

Conclusion: OGGSplat advances generalizable 3D reconstruction by efficiently expanding the field-of-view while maintaining semantic and visual quality.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage framework for video motion transfer using a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to address motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency in large video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators and time-consuming fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA and introduces sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE for faster tuning. Also introduces MotionBench, a benchmark for diverse motion types.

Result: Extensive evaluations on MotionBench demonstrate the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion in performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency, validated by comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

*Wenhao Hu,Xuexiang Wen,Xi Li,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is an end-to-end framework for 3D Gaussian World modeling using dual state observations to address occlusion issues and ensure consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling methods struggle with 3D/physical consistency or require multi-stage processing due to occlusions.

Method: Leverages dual perturbed observations to build segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforcing photometric/semantic consistency and using pseudo intermediate states for alignment.

Result: Achieves stable, complete 3D reconstruction, enabling high-fidelity rendering and object-level manipulation without dense observations.

Conclusion: DSG-World effectively generalizes to novel views and states, advancing real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model using the SRR triplet paradigm for efficient and accurate document parsing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex document parsing pipelines and avoid inefficiencies of large end-to-end models by decomposing the task into three fundamental questions.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm for layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering, trained on the MonkeyDoc dataset.

Result: MonkeyOCR outperforms competitors by 5.1% on average, excels in challenging content like formulas and tables, and processes documents faster.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance with a smaller model, enabling efficient deployment and faster processing.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by addressing input and semantic discrepancies, outperforming existing methods without losing SAM's generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limited adaptability to medical domains and reduced generalization in existing adaptations like MedSAM.

Method: Proposes SAM-TTA with SBCT for input adaptation and DUMT for semantic alignment, using test-time adaptation.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA approaches and surpasses fully fine-tuned models like MedSAM in some cases.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA establishes a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation, balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

*Zhiyun Deng,Dongmyeong Lee,Amanda Adkins,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Christian Ellis,Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework for GPS-denied, off-road environments, addressing perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts. It achieves robust 3-DoF localization using learned viewpoint- and season-invariant representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in GPS-denied, off-road environments include perceptual ambiguities from repetitive vegetation and seasonal shifts, making alignment with outdated satellite imagery difficult.

Method: MoViX uses pose-dependent positive sampling, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and a lightweight temporal aggregator. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization and employs entropy-guided temperature scaling.

Result: On the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, MoViX localizes within 25 meters 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time, outperforming baselines. It also generalizes to a real-world off-road dataset.

Conclusion: MoViX provides accurate and robust localization in challenging off-road environments without environment-specific tuning, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

*Xiaodong Wang,Jinfa Huang,Li Yuan,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeanPO is a reference-free method to mitigate likelihood displacement in Video-LLMs by reformulating rewards and using self-generated preference data, enhancing performance and alignment with human trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques in Video-LLMs inadvertently reduce the likelihood of target responses, worsening with video complexity. LeanPO addresses this issue.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, which reformulates rewards as average likelihood and uses a self-generated preference data pipeline with dynamic label smoothing.

Result: LeanPO significantly improves Video-LLM performance, boosts baselines, and aligns preferences with human trustworthiness.

Conclusion: LeanPO offers a simple, effective solution for reliable and efficient Video-LLMs by mitigating unintended likelihood drops.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, highlighting the importance of bona fide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in PAD systems' limited generalization due to training on few ID documents, hindered by privacy concerns. FM trained on large datasets offer a solution.

Method: The study benchmarks FM capabilities using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on two datasets: a private Chilean ID set and an open-set from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Findings show that bona fide images are crucial for achieving generalization in PAD systems.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a pivotal role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

*Animesh Gupta,Jay Parmar,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR is a new benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving with 180K triplets. It improves over previous benchmarks by linking queries to multiple valid targets. The proposed TF-CoVR-Base framework enhances retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base uses a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification, and (ii) aligning queries with videos via contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR addresses the gap in temporally fine-grained CoVR, and TF-CoVR-Base demonstrates significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-scale bilateral grid to unify appearance codes and bilateral grids, improving geometric accuracy in dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often lack perfect photometric consistency in images, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods like appearance codes and bilateral grids for neural rendering.

Method: The authors introduce a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that combines appearance codes and bilateral grids, addressing photometric inconsistency and optimizing geometry.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in geometric accuracy across four datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, PandaSet) and reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid significantly enhances geometric reconstruction in autonomous driving scenes, proving crucial for obstacle avoidance and control.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior work in handling symmetries and ad-hoc pose regression, and to unify pairwise registration and multi-part assembly tasks.

Method: Learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions, recovering part poses without symmetry labels, and uses a self-supervised encoder for overlapping points.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, with joint training on diverse datasets improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified formulation and self-supervised approach enable effective learning of shared geometric priors, advancing performance in registration and assembly tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

TL;DR: A novel framework improves long-term consistency in video world models by using a geometry-grounded spatial memory, inspired by human memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with scene consistency due to limited temporal context, leading to forgetting of environments.

Method: Introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory for storing and retrieving information, trained on custom datasets.

Result: Shows improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Paves the way for long-term consistent world generation in video models.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: Uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores from query rays, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for 3D shape completion.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to improve explainable AI in medicine by combining concept and image features, ensuring accuracy and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in medical AI, which overlook intrinsic image features and lack stability under perturbations.

Method: Proposes VCT and SVCT, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) and Denoised Diffusion Smoothing to fuse concept and image features for stable, interpretable predictions.

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing faithful explanations even under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT meets medical field needs by balancing interpretability and robustness, advancing the utility of explainable AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across three temporal categories (Past, Present, Future), 11 evaluation dimensions, and 3 visual referencing types. A mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework and multi-scale temporal accuracy metric are developed.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of various MLLMs are conducted using EOC-Bench, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing embodied object cognition.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances MLLMs' embodied object cognitive capabilities, providing a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

### [550] [AliTok: Towards Sequence Modeling Alignment between Tokenizer and Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05289)
*Pingyu Wu,Kai Zhu,Yu Liu,Longxiang Tang,Jian Yang,Yansong Peng,Wei Zhai,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) for autoregressive image generation, ensuring unidirectional dependencies and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers hinder autoregressive models due to bidirectional dependencies during compression.

Method: Introduces AliTok with a causal decoder for unidirectional dependencies, prefix tokens, and two-stage training for consistency.

Result: Achieves gFID 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns tokenizer and autoregressive model, enhancing performance and efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that addresses high-resolution challenges with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, achieving comparable or better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VR methods improve visual quality but are computationally expensive. Distillation-based one-step VR is underexplored, especially for high-resolution videos in real-world settings.

Method: Proposes SeedVR2 with adaptive window attention (dynamically adjusted window size) and adversarial training. Introduces feature matching loss to stabilize training without sacrificing efficiency.

Result: SeedVR2 achieves comparable or better performance than existing VR approaches in a single step, handling high-resolution videos effectively.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 demonstrates the feasibility of efficient one-step VR with adaptive architecture and training enhancements, offering a practical solution for high-resolution video restoration.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

TL;DR: PAM integrates SAM 2 with LLMs for region-level visual understanding, offering efficient segmentation and semantic outputs. It introduces Semantic Perceiver and a data pipeline, achieving speed and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding by combining segmentation and semantic generation in a lightweight, efficient framework.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver for feature transformation, and uses a refined dataset with 1.5M image and 0.6M video annotations.

Result: PAM runs 1.2-2.4x faster, uses less GPU memory, and performs well on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: PAM is a practical, efficient solution and a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual understanding.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using pre-trained vision models.

Method: Trains an adapter to refine features using 3D-aware pseudo-labels, incorporating relaxed cyclic consistency and 3D spherical prototype mapping.

Result: Achieves a 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The method simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces dependency on dataset-specific annotations.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: MARBLE is a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling blending, fine-grained control, and multiple edits in one pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space embeddings and controlling pre-trained models for better material attribute manipulation.

Method: Uses CLIP-space embeddings to blend materials, identifies a UNet block for material attribution, and employs a shallow network for parametric control over attributes like roughness and glow.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows MARBLE's effectiveness in material editing, blending, and fine-grained control.

Conclusion: MARBLE successfully enhances material editing with CLIP-space embeddings, offering parametric control and multi-edit capabilities.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data is challenging, especially with sparse multi-view videos, limiting applications like digital twin creation. Existing methods suffer from error accumulation or fail due to non-convexity.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties jointly, guided by parameter sensitivity, avoiding sequential optimization pitfalls.

Result: ProJo4D outperforms prior work on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material parameter estimation.

Conclusion: ProJo4D effectively addresses the challenges of physically grounded 4D scene understanding, offering scalable and accurate solutions.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), identifies performance gaps in 3D scene-centric approaches, and introduces a new dataset to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to 2D and 3D object-centric approaches and to enhance genuine 3D scene understanding.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs by encoder design, conducts in-depth analysis of 3D scene-centric models, and introduces a new QA dataset to disrupt shortcuts.

Result: 3D scene-centric VLMs rely less on 3D encoders, benefit less from pre-training, and overfit to linguistic cues. The new dataset aims to improve 3D understanding.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and strategies are needed to enhance 3D understanding in VLMs, with the new dataset serving as a step forward.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer, improves depth maps for 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing fragmentation at object boundaries, enhancing rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth maps in 3DGS pipelines often suffer from fragmented or sparse point clouds at object boundaries, degrading rendering quality.

Method: Introduces PM-Loss, leveraging a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer to enforce geometric smoothness in depth maps.

Result: Improved depth maps lead to better rendering quality in 3DGS across various architectures and scenes.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively mitigates depth discontinuities, enhancing the performance of feed-forward 3DGS pipelines.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Motivation: Current MLLMs perform poorly on counting tasks due to limited benchmarks (short videos, close-set queries, lack of clues).

Method: Introduce CG-AV-Counting benchmark with 1,027 questions and 5,845 clues. Propose AV-Reasoner, trained with GRPO and curriculum learning.

Result: AV-Reasoner achieves SOTA results but fails on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting is a comprehensive benchmark; AV-Reasoner shows promise but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language
space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been

TL;DR: MINT-CoT enhances multimodal math reasoning by interleaving visual tokens into textual CoT steps, outperforming baselines on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to multimodal domains is challenging due to reliance on coarse image regions, limited vision encoder perception, and external visual modification needs.

Method: MINT-CoT introduces adaptive interleaving of visual tokens via an Interleave Token, a dataset of 54K math problems, and a three-stage training strategy (text-only SFT, interleaved SFT, and interleaved RL).

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar.

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of annotated long videos for training Video-LMMs.

Method: Created VideoMarathon dataset (9,700 hours, 3.3M QA pairs) and developed Hour-LLaVA with a memory augmentation module for hour-long video processing.

Result: Hour-LLaVA achieves top performance on long video-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA effectively address the gap in long video understanding, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing in videos, combining LLM reasoning with temporal consistency and mask fusion for improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based approaches lack contextual understanding and generalization, which VideoMolmo addresses by integrating large language models and temporal reasoning.

Method: VideoMolmo uses a temporal module with attention for frame consistency and a mask fusion pipeline (SAM2) for bidirectional point propagation. It decomposes the task into LLM-generated coordinates and sequential mask fusion.

Result: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models in spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning, validated on a curated dataset and benchmarks like VPoS-Bench, Refer-VOS, and Reasoning VOS.

Conclusion: VideoMolmo enhances spatio-temporal localization and reasoning, with potential applications in diverse domains. The model and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating defurnished indoor spaces using textured meshes and multi-view panoramas, leveraging SDM and ControlNet inpainting for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create accurate defurnished replicas of indoor spaces, addressing limitations of existing methods like blurry outputs or hallucinations.

Method: Segment and remove furniture from meshes to create SDM, extract Canny edges from SDM, and use ControlNet inpainting to remove furniture from panoramas.

Result: Produces higher quality assets compared to neural radiance fields or RGB-D inpainting methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively generates defurnished indoor spaces with superior quality and accuracy.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor scenes from text descriptions using LLMs, addressing layout generation challenges with spatial reasoning and iterative alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene layout generation either overfit to datasets or rely on rigid constraints, limiting flexibility and alignment with user instructions.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement, aided by CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward.

Result: The framework achieves high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in generated scenes.

Conclusion: DirectLayout advances 3D scene synthesis by combining LLMs with explicit spatial reasoning, offering open-vocabulary and fine-grained control.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework (RAS) to enhance segmentation models with multimodal interactions for better semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex vision-language queries, limiting their effectiveness in user-friendly applications.

Method: The proposed RAS framework augments segmentation models with a mask-centric large multimodal model to handle arbitrary prompts (text or text plus visual entities).

Result: RAS demonstrates superior performance on ORES, as well as classic and generalized referring expression segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in multimodal semantic understanding for segmentation tasks, validated by new datasets and extensive evaluation.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Jiahui Wang,Zuyan Liu,Yongming Rao,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs show sparse visual attention heads; SparseMM optimizes KV-Cache for efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and improve their efficiency by leveraging sparse attention heads.

Method: Analyze attention mechanisms, identify visual heads, and introduce SparseMM for KV-Cache optimization.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance.

Conclusion: SparseMM efficiently optimizes MLLM inference by focusing on sparse visual heads, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system for neural inverse rendering from multi-view videos of light propagation, using time-resolved neural radiance caching for accurate direct and indirect light transport effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and novel capabilities like time-resolved relighting in scenes with strong indirect light.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching to time-resolved data, capturing multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light.

Result: Achieves accurate 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and decomposition of direct/indirect light components.

Conclusion: The system advances inverse rendering with applications in relighting and scene analysis.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeTimeGS introduces a flexible 4D representation for dynamic 3D scenes, improving rendering quality by allowing Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary times and locations with motion functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to deformation field optimization challenges. FreeTimeGS aims to overcome this by offering a more flexible representation.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation where Gaussian primitives can appear at any time/location, each with a motion function to reduce temporal redundancy.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS effectively handles complex motions and improves dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning in videos, covering diverse mathematical domains and requiring integration of visual, audio, and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos is complex due to multimodal, temporally extended content. Existing approaches lack evaluation frameworks for such scenarios.

Method: The benchmark includes 10 mathematical domains, with videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. Graduate-level experts annotated questions for three reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension.

Result: The benchmark provides a systematic evaluation framework, highlighting limitations of current models in cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a foundation for assessing models' reasoning abilities in multimodal, temporally rich mathematical problem-solving contexts.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

### [570] [Contrastive Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05350)
*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching improves conditional diffusion models by enforcing unique flows across conditions, enhancing generation clarity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In conditional settings, flow uniqueness is lost, causing ambiguous generations. The paper aims to address this by ensuring distinct flows for different conditions.

Method: Introduces Contrastive Flow Matching, adding a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarity between flows of arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Achieves faster training (up to 9x), fewer de-noising steps (up to 5x), and lower FID (up to 8.9) compared to standard flow matching.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively enhances condition separation and model performance in conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between practical efficiency of root isolation algorithms and worst-case complexity theory motivates the need for a beyond-worst-case analysis.

Method: A smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients is developed, applied to Descartes algorithm, Sturm solver, ANewDsc, and a sparse polynomial algorithm.

Result: Quasi-linear (expected and smoothed) complexity bounds are demonstrated for Descartes algorithm, explaining its practical efficiency. Other methods are also analyzed.

Conclusion: The smoothed analysis framework successfully bridges theory and practice, providing theoretical justification for observed efficiencies in root isolation algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce beyond-worst-case analysis into symbolic computation. This is an
extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and
we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of
univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation
and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics.
The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and
furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in
literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or
simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications
of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical
performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case
complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials
with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear
(expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one
most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate
polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising
efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that
have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc
a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and
a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.

*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores how the similarity between upstream safety-alignment data and downstream fine-tuning tasks affects LLM vulnerability to jailbreaks, finding low similarity improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak mitigation strategies overlook the role of original safety-alignment data, prompting investigation into its impact.

Method: Analyzes representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream tasks, testing its effect on safety guardrails.

Result: High similarity weakens guardrails, while low similarity reduces harmfulness scores by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Upstream dataset design is crucial for durable safety guardrails, offering insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Motivation: To improve PET image reconstruction speed and quality using regularizing priors, addressing the need for fast and stable convergence in clinical practice.

Method: Evaluated stochastic algorithms (SGD, SAGA, SVRG) on simulated and real PET data from PETRIC 2024, incorporating prior effects into preconditioners.

Result: SVRG and SAGA outperformed SGD, with SVRG showing a slight edge. The findings informed the winning PETRIC 2024 submission.

Conclusion: Incorporating prior effects into preconditioners is key for fast, stable convergence, with SVRG and SAGA being superior choices for PET reconstruction.

Abstract: We investigate subset-based optimization methods for positron emission

reconstruction methods that use a prior, such as the relative difference prior
(RDP), are of particular relevance, as they are widely used in clinical
practice and have been shown to outperform conventional early-stopped and

the main objective was to achieve RDP-regularized reconstructions as fast as
possible, making it an ideal benchmark. Our key finding is that incorporating
the effect of the prior into the preconditioner is crucial for ensuring fast

### [579] [Spectrally accurate and efficient convolution with the 3D free-space Laplace Green's function via the super-potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04489)
*Lukas Exl,Sebastian Schaffer*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A high-accuracy spectral method for solving the 3D Poisson equation using a super-potential formulation and Gaussian-sum approximation, achieving machine-precision accuracy efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a robust and efficient solution to unbounded 3D Poisson equations with smooth, compactly supported sources, overcoming limitations of standard methods.

Method: Uses a super-potential formulation with a biharmonic Green's function and separable Gaussian-sum approximation for FFT-based computation with quasi-linear complexity.

Result: Achieves machine-precision accuracy, outperforms existing Gaussian-sum-based schemes in error and runtime.

Conclusion: The method is a robust and efficient tool for free-space Poisson problems on uniform grids.

Abstract: We present a high-accuracy spectral method for solving the unbounded
three-dimensional Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources.
The approach is based on a super-potential formulation, where the solution is
obtained by applying the Laplacian to a convolution with the biharmonic Green's
function. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient
FFT-based computation with quasi-linear complexity. Owing to the improved
regularity of the biharmonic kernel, the GS cutoff error is of order four,
eliminating the need for correction terms or Taylor expansions required in
standard GS or Ewald-type methods. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the
method achieves machine-precision accuracy and outperforms existing GS-based
schemes in both error and runtime, making it a robust and efficient tool for
free-space Poisson problems on uniform grids.

TL;DR: BridgeNet combines CNNs and physics-informed neural networks to solve Fokker-Planck equations more efficiently than traditional PINNs, achieving lower errors and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with spatial hierarchies and boundary conditions; BridgeNet aims to address these limitations.

Method: Uses adaptive CNN layers for local feature extraction and a dynamically weighted loss function to enforce physical constraints.

Result: Outperforms conventional PINNs in error metrics, convergence speed, and stability in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: BridgeNet advances computational physics with scalable, accurate solutions for diverse applications.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

### [583] [Grapheme-Coherent Phonemic and Prosodic Annotation of Speech by Implicit and Explicit Grapheme Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04527)
*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A model is proposed to generate phonemic and prosodic labels coherent with graphemes, improving consistency and aiding tasks like text-to-speech and accent estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of coherence between graphemes and phonemic/prosodic labels in speech, which limits downstream applications.

Method: Uses implicit grapheme conditioning via BERT features and explicit pruning of inconsistent label hypotheses during inference.

Result: Improved consistency between graphemes and labels, and enhanced performance in accent estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges graphemes and speech labels, benefiting various speech-related applications.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for phoneme-based ASR, outperforming WFST-based systems with relative WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phoneme-based multilingual pre-training is efficient but limited by WFST-based decoding's complexity and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces LLM-P2G with two strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP) and randomized top-K marginalized (TKM) training/decoding.

Result: LLM-P2G achieves relative WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German) compared to WFST-based systems.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G is effective for crosslingual ASR, addressing limitations of WFST-based decoding.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

### [587] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework, enhances sparse retrieval by combining original and LLM-augmented queries, outperforming existing methods and achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion for sparse retrieval, the paper explores zero-shot LLM-based methods to improve performance.

Method: Introduces Exp4Fuse, which uses two retrieval routes (original and LLM-augmented queries), generates ranked lists, and fuses them with a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with advanced sparse retrievers.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse demonstrates superior performance and effectiveness in enhancing query expansion for sparse retrieval, offering a cost-efficient alternative.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a novel method using smaller open-source LMs for query expansion, addressing the cost and accessibility issues of large LLMs. It filters hallucinations and combines documents effectively, outperforming other methods with smaller LMs and competing with large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs for query expansion are costly and computationally intensive. Smaller LMs are more accessible but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistencies.

Method: GOLFer uses a hallucination filter to remove non-factual content and a combiner to merge filtered documents with queries using a weight vector.

Result: GOLFer outperforms other methods with smaller LMs and matches performance of large LLM-based methods on web search and low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: GOLFer provides a cost-effective, efficient alternative to large LLMs for query expansion, maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study explores reducing memory usage in ColPali/ColQwen2 for Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR) by minimizing patch embeddings per page. Token pruning and merging are evaluated, with merging proving more effective. Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 achieves 98.2% performance retention at 11.8% memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in VDR encode pages into multiple patch-level embeddings, causing excessive memory usage. The goal is to reduce embeddings with minimal performance loss.

Method: Two token-reduction strategies are tested: token pruning (random and sophisticated methods) and token merging (optimal combinations across three dimensions).

Result: Token pruning is found unsuitable for VDR. Token merging works better, with Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 maintaining 98.2% performance at 11.8% memory usage and 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for efficient VDR, with Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 serving as a competitive baseline for future research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

### [593] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that decides both what and when to speak, evaluated in online Mafia games. It performs comparably to humans in gameplay and blending in, with behavior mirroring human timing patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world settings like group chats and team meetings lack synchronous turn-taking, requiring agents to decide when to speak. This work addresses the gap in asynchronous communication for LLMs.

Method: Developed an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent and evaluated it using a dataset of online Mafia games with human participants.

Result: The agent performed on par with humans in game performance and blending in, with timing behavior closely mirroring humans but differing in message content.

Conclusion: The work supports realistic asynchronous LLM integration into human group settings, with potential applications in team discussions and educational environments.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

### [595] [Statistical microlocal analysis in two-dimensional X-ray CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05113)
*Anuj Abhishek,Alexander Katsevich,James W. Webber*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces Statistical Microlocal Analysis (SMA) to assess edge detectability in 2D X-ray CT images, accounting for noise and finite sampling, unlike conventional microlocal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional microlocal analysis, which ignores noise and finite sampling, in determining edge detectability in reconstructed images.

Method: Develops SMA, a statistical hypothesis testing framework, to detect and quantify edges in noisy, sampled data using local neighborhood analysis.

Result: Validated through simulations, SMA accurately predicts edge presence, direction, and uncertainty, aligning with experimental observations.

Conclusion: SMA extends classical microlocal analysis by incorporating practical imperfections, offering both theoretical and practical advancements in imaging.

Abstract: In many imaging applications it is important to assess how well the edges of
the original object, $f$, are resolved in an image, $f^\text{rec}$,
reconstructed from the measured data, $g$. In this paper we consider the case
of image reconstruction in 2D X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Let $f$ be a
function describing the object being scanned, and $g=Rf + \eta$ be the Radon
transform data in $\mathbb{R}^2$ corrupted by noise, $\eta$, and sampled with
step size $\sim\epsilon$. Conventional microlocal analysis provides conditions
for edge detectability based on the scanner geometry in the case of continuous,
noiseless data (when $\eta = 0$), but does not account for noise and finite
sampling step size. We develop a novel technique called \emph{Statistical
Microlocal Analysis} (SMA), which uses a statistical hypothesis testing
framework to determine if an image edge (singularity) of $f$ is detectable from
$f^\text{rec}$, and we quantify edge detectability using the statistical power
of the test. Our approach is based on the theory we developed in
\cite{AKW2024_1}, which provides a characterization of $f^\text{rec}$ in local
$O(\epsilon)$-size neighborhoods when $\eta \neq 0$. We derive a statistical
test for the presence and direction of an edge microlocally given the magnitude
of $\eta$ and data sampling step size. Using the properties of the null
distribution of the test, we quantify the uncertainty of the edge magnitude and
direction. We validate our theory using simulations, which show strong
agreement between our predictions and experimental observations. Our work is
not only of practical value, but of theoretical value as well. SMA is a natural
extension of classical microlocal analysis theory which accounts for practical
measurement imperfections, such as noise and finite step size, at the highest
possible resolution compatible with the data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sampling from distributions where global Lipschitz continuity is not satisfied, particularly relevant in deep learning applications.

Method: Proposes kTULA, a novel algorithm based on tamed Langevin dynamics, with theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Result: Achieves a non-asymptotic convergence bound in KL divergence with a rate of $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, improving existing literature, and provides error bounds in Wasserstein-2 distance.

Conclusion: kTULA is applicable to high-dimensional sampling and optimization problems, demonstrating theoretical guarantees for its performance.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Method: Study properties (power-boundedness, Li-Yorke chaos, etc.) for operators on L^p(μ) and C_0(Ω) spaces, with examples from weighted shifts and translations.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes cooperative elements in public goods design using NTU LP games, analyzing core properties, computational complexity, and applying findings to Chicago's bus system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the strategic challenges in public goods deployment by modeling stakeholder cooperation using game theory and linear programming.

Method: Introduces NTU LP games, analyzes core properties (non-emptiness, complexity), and develops a cutting plane algorithm for social welfare optimization.

Result: Provides conditions for non-empty cores, proves co-NP-completeness of core membership, and demonstrates application in transportation planning.

Conclusion: Cooperation is vital for public goods deployment but may have unintended distributive effects, as shown in the Chicago bus system case study.

Abstract: We consider the cooperative elements that arise in the design of public
goods, such as transportation policies and infrastructure. These involve a
variety of stakeholders: governments, businesses, advocates, and users. Their
eventual deployment depends on the decision maker's ability to garner
sufficient support from each of these groups; we formalize these strategic
requirements from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we
introduce non-transferable utility, linear production (NTU LP) games, which
combine the game-theoretic tensions inherent in public decision-making with the
modeling flexibility of linear programming. We derive structural properties
regarding the non-emptiness, representability and complexity of the core, a
solution concept that models the viability of cooperation. In particular, we
provide fairly general sufficient conditions under which the core of an NTU LP
game is guaranteed to be non-empty, prove that determining membership in the
core is co-NP-complete, and develop a cutting plane algorithm to optimize
various social welfare objectives subject to core membership. Lastly, we apply
these results in a data-driven case study on service plan optimization for the
Chicago bus system. As our study illustrates, cooperation is necessary for the
successful deployment of transportation service plans and similar public goods,
but it may also have adverse or counterintuitive distributive implications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by combining LLM prompting and reinforcement learning, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring contextual integrity (CI) is crucial for autonomous agents to decide what information to share appropriately, requiring reasoning about the operating context.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning. A synthetic dataset of ~700 examples with diverse contexts and norms is used for training.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure without compromising task performance, and improvements transfer to human-annotated CI benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses CI in autonomous agents, demonstrating scalability and transferability to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, which can mislead regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a knowledge graph with 117,380 entities and SPARQL queries to retrieve verified subgraphs, ensuring accurate and traceable outputs.

Result: It achieves ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, halves response time, and reduces token usage by 16% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG offers reliable, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, enhancing low-carbon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource

TL;DR: Matter-of-Fact is a dataset for assessing hypothesis feasibility in materials science, showing current models struggle (72% accuracy vs. 50% chance), but expert verification suggests solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated hypothesis generation is cheap, but testing is costly. Filtering feasible hypotheses can scale discovery systems and increase significant findings.

Method: Introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k claims from materials science topics, with qualitative/quantitative claims from theory, experiments, and simulations. Tests baselines like retrieval-augmented generation and code generation.

Result: Baselines achieve 72% accuracy (chance: 50%), but experts verify most claims as solvable, indicating model difficulty but potential for improvement.

Conclusion: The task is challenging for current models, but progress could accelerate scientific discovery by efficiently filtering hypotheses.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the unreliability of benchmark evaluations for reasoning models like Deepseek-R1-Distill due to fluctuating results caused by minor evaluation condition changes. It calls for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in benchmark results of reasoning models, which makes performance claims unreliable and hard to reproduce.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models to demonstrate evaluation fluctuations.

Result: Benchmark results vary significantly with minor changes in evaluation conditions, affecting reproducibility.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed to ensure reliable and consistent performance assessments of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the critical alignment challenge of honesty in LLMs, especially as advanced systems may strategically deceive humans, unlike traditional hallucination issues.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception in CoT-enabled LLMs.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy for deception vectors and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Reveals specific honesty-related issues in reasoning models and provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Method: LFS empowers LLMs to autonomously decide search paths using internal scoring, removing the need for external heuristics or manual tuning.

Result: LFS outperforms ToT-BFS, BestFS, and MCTS in challenging tasks, is more efficient, scales better with stronger models, and benefits from increased compute.

Conclusion: LFS offers a flexible, efficient, and scalable alternative to traditional search methods, especially for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Loan Dao,Ngoc Quoc Ly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-based AI framework for bone disease diagnosis, integrating hierarchical neural networks, VQA, and multimodal data, but lacks experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic domain expertise in medical AI systems, ensuring diagnostic reliability by integrating ontology-based knowledge.

Method: Develops a framework with hierarchical neural networks guided by bone disease ontology, an ontology-enhanced VQA system, and a multimodal deep learning model integrating imaging, clinical, and lab data.

Result: The framework shows potential for broader application due to its standardized structure and reusable components, but experimental validation is pending.

Conclusion: Future work will focus on dataset expansion and comprehensive validation to realize the framework's potential.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by combining LLM prompting and reinforcement learning, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous agents necessitates ensuring contextual integrity (CI) in decision-making, particularly regarding appropriate information sharing.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning. A synthetic dataset of ~700 examples with diverse contexts is used.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure without compromising task performance, and improvements transfer to human-annotated benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses CI in autonomous agents, demonstrating scalability and transferability to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework, improves LLM accuracy in sustainable manufacturing by grounding outputs in a domain-specific knowledge graph, outperforming baselines in QA tasks and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, which can undermine regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Introduces CircuGraphRAG, a framework that uses a knowledge graph (117,380 entities) to ground LLM outputs, translating queries into SPARQL and retrieving verified subgraphs for accuracy.

Result: Outperforms Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG in QA tasks (ROUGE-L F1 up to 1.0 vs. <0.08), halves response time, and reduces token usage by 16%.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG provides reliable, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, enhancing low-carbon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [614] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Matter-of-Fact is a dataset for evaluating the feasibility of scientific hypotheses, showing current models struggle (72% accuracy vs. 50% chance), but experts believe it's solvable, offering potential to enhance automated discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated hypothesis generation is cheap, but testing is costly. Filtering feasible hypotheses could scale discovery systems and increase significant findings.

Method: Introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k claims from materials science topics, tested with retrieval-augmented generation and code generation baselines.

Result: Baselines achieve 72% accuracy (chance: 50%), but experts suggest most claims are solvable, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: The task is challenging for current models, but progress could accelerate scientific discovery by improving feasibility filtering.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in benchmark results of popular reasoning models, which undermines their claimed performance improvements.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models under varied evaluation conditions.

Result: Significant fluctuations in benchmark results were observed, indicating unreliability in current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: A call for a more rigorous evaluation paradigm to ensure reproducible and reliable model performance assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses strategic deception in LLMs with CoT reasoning, using representation engineering to detect and control it, achieving high accuracy and providing tools for AI alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating strategic deception in LLMs, especially those with CoT reasoning, is crucial for trustworthy AI alignment.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy for deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception.

Conclusion: The study highlights honesty-related issues in reasoning models and offers tools for improving AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional party fragmentation measures (e.g., ENP) fail to capture Africa's political nuances, such as dominant parties and ethnic cleavages.

Method: Proposes two 'apolitical' measures focusing on population size and territorial area, ensuring a minimum of two parties.

Result: The new models provide a simpler, contextually relevant framework for analyzing African political systems, even in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: The approach offers a valuable tool for understanding political dynamics in Africa, with potential broader applicability.

Abstract: Political fragmentation in Africa poses to a significant challenge to

fragmentation, such as the Effective Number of Parties (ENP) index, often fail
to capture the nuanced realities of African political landscapes, particularly
the influence of dominant parties, fluid party affiliations, and the impact of
ethnic and regional cleavages. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces two novel "apolitical" or "institutionally neutral" measures for
calculating the effective number of parties, focusing on geographical and

incorporating these local realities and ensuring a minimum threshold of two

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in federated learning (FL) when using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), showing how maliciously designed pretrained models and adapters can leak user data via gradient inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight privacy vulnerabilities in FL with PEFT, where users fine-tune lightweight modules while keeping the backbone model frozen, and to demonstrate how gradients from these modules can be exploited to reconstruct private data.

Method: The study conducts gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism (the adapter), using accessible adapter gradients to reconstruct local user data samples.

Result: Experiments show that a large batch of fine-tuning images can be reconstructed with high fidelity, revealing significant privacy risks.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT and open avenues for future research to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning method integrates Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement, improving visibility without color distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise assumptions like Gaussian noise fail in low-light conditions where Poisson noise is more accurate. Addressing this gap is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: Combines Retinex-based decomposition with Poisson denoising in an encoder-decoder network, using a Poisson denoising loss for signal-dependent noise.

Result: Enhances visibility and brightness while preserving image structure and color constancy under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively denoises and enhances low-light images, demonstrating practicality and superior performance.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: DACN, a dual-attention CNN, improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining multi-head attention and channel attention, outperforming single attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D CNNs lack global contextual understanding and suffer from band correlation and data scarcity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Method: DACN uses augmented convolutions with multi-head attention for local-global feature capture, separate channel-spatial attention maps, and a custom loss function combining L2 regularization and spatial-spectral gradient loss.

Result: Experiments on two hyperspectral datasets show DACN outperforms single attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: DACN effectively addresses limitations of 2D CNNs in hyperspectral super-resolution by integrating dual-attention mechanisms and a specialized loss function.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

TL;DR: PixCell is a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset (PanCan-30M) to synthesize diverse, high-quality images. It addresses data scarcity, privacy concerns, and enables tasks like virtual staining and targeted augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage generative models for solving unique challenges in pathology, such as data scarcity, privacy-preserving data sharing, and generative tasks like virtual staining.

Method: PixCell uses a progressive training strategy and self-supervision-based conditioning on PanCan-30M, a large dataset of H&E-stained slides, without requiring annotated data.

Result: PixCell generates high-quality synthetic images usable for training discriminative models, targeted augmentation, and inferring molecular marker results (e.g., IHC staining from H&E).

Conclusion: PixCell is a versatile foundation model for computational pathology, capable of addressing multiple challenges while improving downstream tasks and enabling open research.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively reconciles global context modeling with spatial topology preservation, advancing 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in federated learning (FL) when using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), demonstrating gradient inversion attacks that can reconstruct user data from adapter gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in FL with PEFT, as malicious pretrained models and adapters can leak user data via gradient inversion.

Method: Investigates gradient inversion attacks on PEFT adapters, using accessible gradients to reconstruct local data samples.

Result: Shows that large batches of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity, exposing privacy vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

### [627] [A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470)
*Isha Rao,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning method integrates Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement, improving visibility without color distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise assumptions like Gaussian noise fail in low-light conditions where Poisson noise dominates, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: Combines Retinex-based decomposition with Poisson denoising in an encoder-decoder network, using a Poisson denoising loss to handle signal-dependent noise.

Result: Enhances visibility and brightness while preserving image structure and color constancy under low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses Poisson noise in low-light images, offering practical enhancement without prior reflectance or illumination knowledge.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DACN, a dual-attention CNN, improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining multi-head and channel attention, addressing limitations of local context and band correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D CNNs lack global contextual understanding and struggle with band correlation and data scarcity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Method: DACN uses augmented convolutions with multi-head attention for local-global feature capture, separate channel-spatial attention maps, and a custom loss function (L2 + spatial-spectral gradient loss).

Result: DACN outperforms single-attention mechanisms on two hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-attention approach in DACN effectively enhances hyperspectral image super-resolution by balancing local and global context.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PixCell is a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset (PanCan-30M) without annotated data, enabling diverse image generation for tasks like data augmentation, privacy-preserving sharing, and virtual staining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in pathology like annotated data scarcity, privacy concerns, and generative tasks (e.g., virtual staining), leveraging generative models for realistic image synthesis.

Method: Uses a progressive training strategy and self-supervision-based conditioning on PanCan-30M dataset (69,184 H&E-stained slides). Generates high-quality images and allows precise control via annotated images.

Result: PixCell produces diverse, high-quality synthetic images usable for training discriminative models, data augmentation, and inferring molecular markers (e.g., IHC staining from H&E).

Conclusion: PixCell is a versatile foundation model for computational pathology, offering solutions for data scarcity, privacy, and generative tasks, with potential applications in research and education.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models, offering convexity and continuity advantages over classical divergences. It provides theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements in convergence, stability, and mode collapse prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical divergences (e.g., KL, Wasserstein) in training implicit generative models by proposing a convex and continuous rank-based discrepancy metric.

Method: Develops dual-ISL, a convex optimization problem in model densities, and analyzes its properties (continuity, convexity). Extends to multivariate settings via random projections and derives theoretical bounds.

Result: Dual-ISL outperforms classical ISL and other methods in convergence speed, training stability, and mode collapse prevention, while enabling explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL is a robust and effective tool for training implicit generative models, with theoretical and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes zero-order (ZO) optimization methods, JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon, for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam are memory- and compute-intensive for LLMs, prompting the need for efficient alternatives like ZO methods.

Method: The authors introduce JAGUAR SignSGD, a ZO momentum-based algorithm, and JAGUAR Muon, a ZO extension of the Muon optimizer, both designed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).

Result: The proposed methods achieve convergence comparable to first-order methods with significant memory savings, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: ZO optimization methods are a practical and theoretically sound solution for resource-constrained LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of second-order methods in neural network training by explicitly modeling structured gradient uncertainty without expensive computations.

Method: Estimates parameter covariance matrix recursively using compact gradient covariance products, avoiding full matrix storage and inversions.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while maintaining first-order efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ successfully balances accuracy and efficiency, making it a viable alternative to existing optimization methods.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the phenomenon of no-regret learning acceleration beyond isolated cases and provide a faster, adaptable method for general games.

Method: Proposes Cautious Optimism, which takes any FTRL instance and accelerates it with minimal overhead, retaining uncoupledness.

Result: Achieves near-optimal O_T(log T) regret in self-play and optimal O(sqrt(T)) in adversarial settings, outperforming prior works.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a novel, efficient approach for fast learning in general games without relying on monotonic step-sizes.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key for robustness. It shows AT initially learns these features but shifts to class-specific ones during overfitting, unifying insights on soft-label training and robust overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT) by analyzing class-wise feature attribution, particularly focusing on cross-class features.

Method: The study uses theoretical evidence and systematic experiments across various model architectures to analyze the role of cross-class and class-specific features in AT.

Result: AT initially learns cross-class features for robustness but shifts to class-specific features during overfitting, linking to soft-label training and robust overfitting.

Conclusion: The findings refine AT understanding, offering new perspectives on its mechanisms and dynamics, with implications for future research.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence behavior of a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections, showing linear convergence under proper initialization. Residual connections improve optimization stability by addressing ill-conditioning in the attention output matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of Transformers, their theoretical foundations, especially regarding training dynamics, are underdeveloped. Existing research often examines components in isolation, neglecting interdependencies, particularly with residual connections.

Method: The study analyzes a structurally complete single-layer Transformer, including self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections. It investigates gradient descent convergence under appropriate initialization and extends findings to multi-layer architectures.

Result: Gradient descent exhibits linear convergence, with speed determined by the singular values of the attention output matrix. Residual connections mitigate ill-conditioning caused by the softmax operation, enhancing optimization stability. Empirical results support these findings.

Conclusion: The paper bridges a theoretical gap by demonstrating the linear convergence of Transformers under proper initialization and highlighting the stabilizing role of residual connections. The insights extend to multi-layer architectures, validated empirically.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

TL;DR: The paper provides a tight analysis of error feedback schemes (EF and EF²¹) in distributed learning, comparing their convergence rates with compressed gradient descent using Lyapunov functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication compression in distributed learning often degrades convergence, and error feedback schemes like EF and EF²¹ aim to mitigate this. A principled analysis is needed to compare their performance.

Method: The study uses Lyapunov functions to derive tight convergence rates for EF and EF²¹, with matching lower bounds, in a simplified setting for clarity.

Result: The analysis yields sharp performance guarantees, enabling a rigorous comparison between EF, EF²¹, and compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for evaluating and comparing error feedback schemes, offering insights into their effectiveness in distributed learning.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, analyzing benchmarks and proposing ways to assess representational systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument for systematicity of representations and the focus on behavioral systematicity in existing benchmarks and models.

Method: Analyzes key benchmarks in language and vision using Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization and highlights methods from mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Identifies limitations in current benchmarks and suggests assessing representational systematicity to better align with theoretical arguments.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need to evaluate systematicity of representations in ML models, drawing from mechanistic interpretability practices.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

### [641] [Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04566)
*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve differentially private (DP) language model inference by clustering input data and using median aggregation for next-token predictions, enhancing text quality and privacy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially with heterogeneous topics. The paper aims to address this by improving batch selection and aggregation methods.

Method: Clusters input data before batch selection and introduces median aggregation for next-token predictions, leveraging reduced local sensitivity for better privacy guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates improved representativeness (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance, achieving higher-quality synthetic data at lower privacy cost.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering and median-based aggregation method outperforms prior uniform sampling approaches, offering better privacy and text quality.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: Urania is a framework for analyzing LLM chatbot interactions with differential privacy, using private clustering and keyword extraction methods to ensure privacy while preserving data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous privacy guarantees for LLM chatbot interactions while extracting meaningful insights, addressing the trade-off between data utility and privacy.

Method: Employs private clustering, keyword extraction (frequency-based, TF-IDF, LLM-guided), and DP tools (clustering, partition selection, histogram summarization). Evaluated using lexical/semantic metrics and empirical privacy tests.

Result: Demonstrates effective extraction of conversational insights with strong privacy protection, outperforming non-private benchmarks.

Conclusion: Urania successfully balances privacy and utility, offering a robust solution for private LLM interaction analysis.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of narrow-use-case approaches in healthcare by enabling holistic, longitudinal patient data interpretation for personalized care.

Method: Transforms diverse EHR data into structured representations and uses a summary mechanism to embed long-term temporal context into topic-specific tokens.

Result: Outperforms baselines in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, enabling detailed patient trajectory simulations.

Conclusion: EHR2Path advances predictive and personalized healthcare by efficiently modeling patient pathways and supporting diverse evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes key aspects of RL in long-context reasoning, highlighting the roles of positive/negative samples, data inefficiency, and performance instability, proposing solutions for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data inefficiency, and performance instability.

Method: Systematic analysis of RL sample roles, strategies to improve data efficiency (relative length rewards, offline sample injection), and investigation of performance instability via multiple evaluation runs.

Result: Positive samples aid data fitting; negative samples boost generalization. Data inefficiency identified; proposed strategies improve reasoning. Performance instability linked to ambiguous problems; mitigated by multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and solutions for improving RL in long-context reasoning, emphasizing the importance of negative samples, data efficiency, and robust evaluation.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to mitigate degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, and existing GCL methods provide insufficient and noisy information for low-degree nodes.

Method: Introduces HAR contrastive loss to add more positive pairs using node labels and adaptively weights pairs based on learning hardness. Develops SHARP framework for broader application.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR and SHARP effectively address degree bias in GNNs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallelism across segments, reducing inference time and costs without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiencies with long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs address this but suffer from sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching is introduced as a scheduling scheme to parallelize RMT segments while maintaining exact recurrence, eliminating sequential constraints.

Result: Applied to LLaMA-1B ARMT, Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMT on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching enhances RMTs for practical long-context applications by reducing latency and inference costs.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer, derived from an in-context loss, and demonstrates its superior performance in language modeling, especially for long-context tasks, at the cost of increased inference compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers dominate sequence modeling but have linear memory and compute costs during inference. Recent RNN models like DeltaNet, Mamba, or xLSTM offer constant costs, but the paper aims to improve their performance by optimizing an in-context loss.

Method: The authors propose a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer, derived from an in-context regression objective, optimized using a fast conjugate gradient solver.

Result: The method achieves lower perplexity and better downstream performance than previous RNNs, particularly in long-context tasks, but requires additional inference-time compute.

Conclusion: The work aligns with trends of increasing test-time compute for performance gains, showing that solving sequential optimization problems within the network itself can enhance results.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*Yifan Sun,Jingyan Shen,Yibin Wang,Tianyu Chen,Zhendong Wang,Mingyuan Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques—difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay—to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing training time by 25-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing methods lack focus on data efficiency.

Method: Introduces adaptive difficulty for data selection and an attention-based framework for efficient difficulty estimation, plus rollout replay to reduce computation.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25-65% while matching performance of the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs, offering practical benefits for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, showing smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to overlooked memory bottlenecks. It advocates for sparse attention to optimize test-time compute efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work underestimates memory access bottlenecks in test-time strategies, leading to inefficient resource allocation. The study aims to correct this by analyzing computation and memory costs.

Method: The authors analyze models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, proposing the Kinetics Scaling Law and a sparse attention paradigm to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, achieving significant accuracy gains (60+ points in low-cost, 5+ in high-cost regimes) on AIME benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for maximizing test-time scaling potential, as it enables longer generations and better accuracy without saturating like parameter scaling.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the KV cache in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens to be generated within the same compute budget while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key-value (KV) cache in Transformer LLMs bottlenecks generation cost, limiting efficiency. The paper aims to address this by compressing the KV cache to enhance reasoning accuracy without increasing compute costs.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a method that sparsifies KV caches with minimal training (1K steps) and achieves 8× compression while maintaining accuracy. DMS delays token eviction to preserve critical information.

Result: DMS boosts accuracy across multiple LLM families, e.g., improving Qwen-R1 32B by 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench, without increasing runtime or memory load.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is practical and effective, enhancing LLM performance by compressing the KV cache and preserving accuracy at high compression ratios.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one training run, outperforming grid search in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model training involves multiple runs for loss selection and weighting, which is inefficient. YOTO aims to streamline this by optimizing loss weights in one shot.

Method: YOTO treats loss hyperparameters as network parameters, using gradient-based optimization and a differentiable composite loss formulation with a softmax layer. A regularization loss ensures bounded optima.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid-search models in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks on unseen test data.

Conclusion: YOTO provides an efficient, one-shot solution for loss hyperparameter optimization, improving performance and reducing training overhead.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accommodate multiple large models within constrained memory budgets efficiently.

Method: Uses SVD for task-specific weight distributions, a lightweight learner (StatsMergeLearner), and task-specific teacher distillation for heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, generalization, and robustness across eight tasks.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is effective for merging models without labels, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

TL;DR: Scaling laws are used to compare models (CLIP and MaMMUT) and datasets, showing MaMMUT's better scalability and efficiency. The method avoids single-scale biases and supports systematic model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison of models and datasets for pre-training by deriving scaling laws, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-scale measurements.

Method: Derive full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT using dense measurements across model and sample scales. Compare models on downstream tasks and datasets.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP. Consistent trends observed across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a robust method for model and dataset comparison, supporting systematic improvements in foundation models.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using bidirectional bounds (maximizing a lower bound and minimizing an upper bound) to stabilize training of Energy-based Models (EBMs), comparing four bounds and demonstrating improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are challenging to train due to instabilities when minimizing a lower bound. The paper aims to stabilize EBM training by using bidirectional bounds.

Method: The authors derive and compare four bounds on log-likelihood: two lower bounds (based on generator Jacobian singular values and mutual information) and two upper bounds (gradient penalty-like and diffusion-based). Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, leading to high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Using bidirectional bounds is effective for stabilizing EBM training and improving performance in density estimation and generation tasks.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns learnable latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models, avoiding expensive likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently, leveraging flow models as priors.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss reformulating flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

### [656] [Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using a Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04700)
*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models, offering convexity and continuity advantages over classical divergences. It provides theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements in convergence, stability, and mode collapse prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical divergences (e.g., KL or Wasserstein distances) in training implicit generative models, the authors propose dual-ISL, which interchanges target and model distributions for a convex optimization problem.

Method: The method involves defining a rank-based discrepancy (d_K) with proven convexity and continuity properties, interpreting it as an L²-projection of the density ratio onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, and extending it to multivariate settings via random projections.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows d_K's advantages, and empirical results demonstrate faster convergence, smoother training, better stability, and improved mode collapse prevention compared to classical ISL and other methods.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL is a robust and effective tool for training implicit generative models, with theoretical and practical benefits over existing approaches.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

*Egor Petrov,Grigoriy Evseev,Aleksey Antonov,Andrey Veprikov,Pavel Plyusnin,Nikolay Bushkov,Stanislav Moiseev,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes zero-order (ZO) optimization methods, JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon, for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining convergence quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam are computationally expensive for fine-tuning LLMs, prompting the need for memory- and compute-efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors introduce JAGUAR SignSGD, a ZO momentum-based algorithm, and JAGUAR Muon, a ZO extension of the Muon optimizer, leveraging matrix structures. Both methods require fewer resources than first-order methods.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve or surpass the convergence quality of first-order methods, significantly reducing memory usage, as demonstrated in LLM fine-tuning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZO optimization methods are a practical and theoretically grounded solution for resource-constrained LLM adaptation, supported by both theoretical guarantees and empirical results.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm for neural networks, improving upon KOALA by modeling structured gradient uncertainty efficiently without expensive second-order calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of second-order methods in neural network training while capturing richer gradient uncertainty structure.

Method: Estimates parameter covariance matrix recursively using compact gradient covariance products, avoiding full matrix storage and inversions.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art optimizers in tasks like image classification and language modeling, with first-order efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ offers a balanced approach, combining accuracy and efficiency by modeling structured uncertainty without computational overhead.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Cautious Optimism,' a framework for accelerating no-regret learning in general games by adaptively pacing FTRL algorithms, achieving near-optimal regret guarantees without relying on monotonic step-sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that adaptive pacing for no-regret learning is not limited to specific cases and to provide a general framework for faster learning in games.

Method: Proposes 'Cautious Optimism,' which takes any FTRL instance and accelerates it with minimal overhead, retaining uncoupledness.

Result: Achieves near-optimal O_T(log T) regret in self-play and maintains O(sqrt(T)) regret in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel, efficient approach to fast learning in general games without monotonic step-size constraints.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key for robust classification. It shows AT initially learns these features but shifts to class-specific ones during robust overfitting, unifying insights into AT mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT) by analyzing class-wise feature attribution, particularly focusing on cross-class features.

Method: The study uses theoretical evidence from a synthetic data model and systematic experiments across various model architectures to analyze the role of cross-class features in AT.

Result: AT initially learns cross-class features for robustness but shifts to class-specific features during robust overfitting. The findings unify existing AT properties like soft-label training advantages.

Conclusion: The insights refine understanding of AT mechanisms, offering new perspectives for future research. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

*Zhen Qin,Jinxin Zhou,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence behavior of a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections, showing linear convergence under proper initialization and highlighting the role of residual connections in optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success, the theoretical understanding of Transformers, especially their training dynamics and component interdependencies, remains underdeveloped.

Method: The study examines a structurally complete single-layer Transformer, analyzing gradient descent convergence under specific initialization conditions and the impact of residual connections.

Result: Gradient descent achieves linear convergence, influenced by the attention layer's output matrix singular values, with residual connections mitigating ill-conditioning.

Conclusion: Residual connections enhance optimization stability, and the findings extend to multi-layer Transformers, supported by empirical validation.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a tight analysis of error feedback schemes (EF and EF²¹) in distributed learning, comparing their convergence rates and performance with compressed gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bottlenecks in distributed learning due to compressed information exchange degrade convergence, prompting the need for precise analysis of error feedback methods.

Method: The study uses Lyapunov functions to derive optimal convergence rates for EF and EF²¹, with matching lower bounds, in a simplified setting for clarity.

Result: The analysis yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous comparison between EF, EF²¹, and compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: The work offers principled insights into error feedback mechanisms, facilitating fair comparisons and improved understanding of their convergence properties.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, analyzing benchmarks and proposing ways to assess representational systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument for systematicity of representations and the focus on behavioral systematicity in existing benchmarks and models.

Method: Analyzes benchmarks in language and vision using Hadley's taxonomy of systematic generalization and highlights methods from mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Identifies limitations in current benchmarks and suggests approaches to evaluate representational systematicity.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need to shift focus from behavioral to representational systematicity in ML models for better generalization.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve differentially private (DP) language model inference by clustering input data and using median aggregation for next-token predictions, enhancing text quality and privacy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially for heterogeneous topics. The paper aims to address this by improving batch selection and aggregation methods.

Method: Clusters input data before sampling batches and aggregates next-token predictions using medians instead of averages, leveraging reduced local sensitivity for better privacy guarantees.

Result: The method improves representativeness (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance, achieving higher-quality synthetic data at lower privacy cost compared to prior work.

Conclusion: Clustering and median-based aggregation enhance DP language model inference, offering better text quality and privacy efficiency.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Result: Balances data utility and privacy, preserving lexical/semantic content and demonstrating robustness via empirical evaluation.

Conclusion: Urania effectively extracts insights while maintaining stringent user privacy.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM

framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided

Motivation: Healthcare systems struggle with managing diverse patient data for personalized care, lacking holistic approaches for longitudinal interactions.

Method: Proposes EHR2Path, a model that structures EHR data and uses a summary mechanism for long-term temporal context, optimizing pathway prediction.

Result: EHR2Path excels in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming baselines in tasks like vital signs forecasting.

Conclusion: EHR2Path enables predictive, personalized healthcare by simulating patient trajectories and addressing diverse evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data efficiency, and performance stability.

Method: Systematic analysis of RL samples, strategies for data efficiency (relative length rewards, offline injection), and multiple evaluation runs for stability.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization; data inefficiency identified and mitigated; multiple evaluations stabilize performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and practical solutions for improving RL in long-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to mitigate degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, and existing GCL methods provide insufficient and noisy information for low-degree nodes.

Method: Proposes HAR contrastive loss to add more positive pairs using node labels and adaptive weighting based on learning hardness. Also introduces SHARP framework for broader application.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR and SHARP effectively mitigate degree bias in GNNs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallel execution across segments, reducing inference time and cost for long-context tasks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiencies in long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs address this but suffer from sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme, allows parallelism in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence, eliminating sequential constraints.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMT on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching makes RMTs more practical for real-world long-context applications by reducing inference cost and latency.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer, derived from an in-context loss, optimized for language modeling at scale, outperforming previous RNNs but with higher inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the linear scaling of memory and compute in transformers during inference, the paper explores RNN models like DeltaNet, Mamba, and xLSTM, unifying them under an in-context regression objective.

Method: The authors propose a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer, optimized using a fast conjugate gradient solver for in-context loss minimization at every time point.

Result: The model achieves lower perplexity and better downstream performance than previous RNNs, especially in long-context tasks, though with increased inference flops.

Conclusion: The work aligns with trends of increasing test-time compute for performance gains, here by solving sequential optimization within the network.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25%-65% compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, showing smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to overlooked memory bottlenecks. Sparse attention is proposed to optimize test-time compute, outperforming dense models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of smaller models in test-time scenarios due to memory access bottlenecks, overlooked by prior compute-optimal approaches.

Method: Holistic analysis of models (0.6B to 32B parameters) leading to the Kinetics Scaling Law, advocating sparse attention to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, with significant accuracy gains (60+ points in low-cost, 5+ in high-cost regimes) on AIME benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for test-time scaling, as it enables longer generations and better resource use, unlike parameter scaling in training.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

### [673] [Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345)
*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the KV cache in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens to be generated within the same compute budget while improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key-value (KV) cache in Transformer LLMs bottlenecks generation cost, limiting efficiency. The paper aims to address this by compressing the KV cache to enhance accuracy without increasing compute costs.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a method that sparsifies KV caches with minimal training (1K steps) and delays token eviction to preserve critical information.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. It boosts accuracy on benchmarks like AIME 24, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench for models like Qwen-R1 32B.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is effective, improving accuracy without additional runtime or memory costs, making it a practical solution for scaling LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

### [674] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one shot via gradient-based methods, outperforming grid search in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model training involves multiple runs for loss selection and weighting, which is inefficient. YOTO aims to streamline this by optimizing loss weights in a single training session.

Method: YOTO treats loss hyperparameters as regular network parameters, using a differentiable composite loss formulation with a softmax layer to ensure positivity and avoid degenerate gradients. A novel regularization loss enforces uniformity and boundedness.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid-search models in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks on unseen test data.

Conclusion: YOTO provides an efficient, one-shot solution for loss hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a lightweight, learning-based model merging method that uses weight distribution statistics and SVD to guide merging without needing labels or test samples. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accommodating multiple large models within constrained memory budgets without relying on ground truth labels or test samples.

Method: StatsMerging leverages SVD for task-specific weight distributions, uses a lightweight learner (StatsMergeLearner), and introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments show StatsMerging outperforms existing methods in accuracy, generalization, and robustness across eight tasks.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective, label-free solution for model merging, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how scaling laws can be used to compare models and datasets for pre-training, focusing on CLIP and MaMMUT, showing MaMMUT's superior scalability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison of foundation models and datasets across scales, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-scale evaluations.

Method: Derived full scaling laws using dense measurements for CLIP and MaMMUT, comparing their performance across tasks and datasets with varying scales.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP, consistently across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a robust method for model and dataset comparison, facilitating systematic improvement of foundation models.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs) to improve stability and performance, comparing four bounds derived from different perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are difficult to train due to instabilities from minimizing lower bounds. The authors aim to stabilize training by using bidirectional bounds.

Method: The authors derive and compare four bounds: two lower bounds (based on singular values and mutual information) and two upper bounds (gradient penalty-like and diffusion-based). Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, leading to high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Using bidirectional bounds is effective for stabilizing EBM training and improving performance in density estimation and generation.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns learnable latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models, avoiding expensive likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently, avoiding computational bottlenecks like likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss derived from flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale image generation experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores thick and thickly embedded links in Euclidean space, focusing on the Gehring ropelength problem and constructing examples of links that resist splitting via thick homotopy or isotopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the constraints on link homotopy and isotopy when thickness is preserved, and to identify local minima for ropelength in such contexts.

Method: Defines thick and thickly embedded links, introduces thick homotopy/isotopy, and constructs explicit examples of links that cannot be split under these conditions.

Result: Constructs a thickly embedded 4-component link that is topologically split but not via thick homotopy, and identifies non-global local minima for ropelength in 2-component links.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the existence of links resistant to splitting under thickness-preserving homotopy/isotopy, providing the first explicit examples of such local minima for ropelength.

Abstract: A thick link is a link in Euclidean three-space such that each component of
the link lies at distance at least 1 from every other component. Strengthening
the notion of thickness, we define a thickly embedded link to be a thick link
whose open radius-1/2 normal disk bundles of all components are embedded. The
Gehring ropelength problem asks how large the sum of the lengths of the
components of a thick (respectively thickly embedded) link must be, given the
link homotopy (respectively isotopy) class of the link. A thick homotopy
(isotopy) is a link homotopy (isotopy) of a thick (thickly embedded) link that
preserves thickness throughout, and such that during the homotopy the total
length of the link never exceeds the initial total length. These notions of
thick homotopy and isotopy are more permissive than other notions of physical
link isotopies in which the length of each individual component must remain
constant (no "length trading"). We construct an explicit example of a thickly
embedded 4-component link which is topologically split but cannot be split by a
thick homotopy, and thick links in every homotopy class with 2 components that
are non-global local minima for ropelength. This is the first time such local
minima for ropelength have been explicitly constructed. In particular, we
construct a thick 2-component link in the link homotopy class of the unlink
which cannot be split through a thick homotopy.

Motivation: Traditional methods compromise perceptual consistency due to predefined noise schedules. This work aims to preserve structural fidelity and transfer stylistic attributes more effectively.

Method: Uses continuous-time diffusion models with SSIMBaD, a sigma-space transformation aligning perceptual degradation linearly for uniform visual difficulty.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality on a large-scale Anime face dataset.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes to diverse styles and achieves superior results, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods suffer from low quality, manual tuning, or data-intensive training.

Method: Uses VLM for handle selection via prompt engineering, cone singularity detection, and multi-view voting to reduce uncertainty.

Result: Produces deformations aligning closely with user intent (measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D) with low distortion.

Conclusion: Training-free, automated, and delivers high-quality mesh deformations.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

TL;DR: VoxDet introduces an instance-centric framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction by converting voxel labels into instance-level offsets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat 3D semantic occupancy prediction as dense segmentation, neglecting instance-level discriminability. VoxDet leverages implicit instance-level insights from voxel labels.

Method: VoxDet decouples occupancy prediction into offset regression and semantic prediction, using a Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder and Task-decoupled Dense Predictor.

Result: VoxDet achieves 63.0 IoU on SemanticKITTI, ranking 1st on the leaderboard, and works efficiently with both camera and LiDAR inputs.

Conclusion: VoxDet demonstrates that instance-aware prediction improves 3D semantic occupancy, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

Method: Three-phase scheme: initial segmentation (detects high-curvature vertices), iterative vertex insertion (adds low-curvature vertices), and iterative merging (removes redundant vertices), followed by vertex adjustment for aesthetics.

Result: The scheme is faster than state-of-the-art methods and competitive in Rosin's measure and aesthetic quality. Robust under geometric transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, robust, and produces high-quality polygonal approximations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for Anime-style sketch colorization using SSIMBaD for balanced and faithful reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods compromise perceptual consistency with predefined noise schedules; this work aims to preserve structural fidelity and stylistic attributes.

Method: Uses continuous-time diffusion models with SSIMBaD, a sigma-space transformation aligning perceptual degradation linearly for uniform visual difficulty.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality on a large-scale Anime face dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generalizes to diverse styles while maintaining high fidelity and perceptual consistency.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

*Xingpeng Sun,Shiyang Jia,Zherong Pan,Kui Wu,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for high-quality, automated deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods suffer from low quality, manual tuning, or data-intensive training.

Method: Uses VLM for handle selection via prompt engineering, cone singularity detection, and multi-view voting to reduce uncertainty.

Result: Produces deformations aligning closely with user intent, measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, with low distortion.

Conclusion: The approach is training-free, automated, and delivers high-quality mesh deformations consistently.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

### [689] [VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623)
*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoxDet, an instance-centric framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, leveraging voxel-level labels to improve instance-level accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat 3D semantic occupancy prediction as dense segmentation, neglecting instance-level discriminability. The paper highlights the overlooked potential of voxel-level labels for instance-level insights.

Method: Proposes VoxDet, which reformulates the task as dense object detection via two sub-tasks: offset regression and semantic prediction. Uses a Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder and Task-decoupled Dense Predictor.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results (63.0 IoU on SemanticKITTI) and works with both camera and LiDAR inputs.

Conclusion: VoxDet efficiently addresses instance-level incompleteness and ambiguities, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

### [693] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Parler TTS, a large speech model, to reconstruct voices of dysarthric speakers pre-onset. While the model learns from challenging data, it struggles with intelligibility and speaker identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech disorders hinder communication; personalized Text-to-Speech (TTS) offers a potential aid. The study aims to reconstruct pre-onset voices of dysarthric speakers using advanced TTS technology.

Method: A dataset is curated and annotated with speaker and intelligibility details. The Parler TTS model is fine-tuned on this data to generate speech approximating pre-onset voices.

Result: The model learns to generate speech from the dataset but faces challenges in controlling intelligibility and maintaining consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving controllability of such models for voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the

Result: Interleaved approach achieves best alignment but is slow; ESI pattern speeds up decoding and slightly improves performance. QA datasets enhance speech QA.

Conclusion: The ESI pattern and curated QA datasets offer practical improvements for joint speech-text decoding, balancing alignment and efficiency.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct human testing of exoskeletons is risky and inconsistent; a controlled, repeatable environment is needed for safer evaluations.

Method: A bipedal robot mimics human gait using SDRE-optimized torque control and a parameterized method to simplify control while aligning with motor constraints.

Result: The method successfully replicates human gait, reducing computational load and ensuring compatibility with motor dynamics.

Conclusion: The bipedal robot platform offers a reliable, repeatable way to evaluate exoskeletons, enhancing safety and control in testing.

Abstract: Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to
assist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible
exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a
safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal
robot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton
evaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation
(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait
replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum
model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human
motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized
control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively
replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping
trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear
velocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This
modification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring
compatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes
the control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and
torques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in

TL;DR: RoboRefer is a 3D-aware VLM integrating depth encoding and reinforcement fine-tuning for precise spatial understanding and reasoning in robots, outperforming benchmarks like Gemini-2.5-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack accuracy in understanding complex 3D scenes and reasoning about instruction-indicated locations for robot interaction.

Method: RoboRefer uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for depth encoding and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for multi-step reasoning, supported by the RefSpatial dataset and benchmark.

Result: SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves 89.6% success rate; RFT-trained version surpasses baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4%.

Conclusion: RoboRefer enables accurate spatial referring and dynamic task execution in diverse real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA is a method for estimating traversability based on approach angles using point clouds, improving efficiency and generalization with Fourier basis functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of terrain traversability dependency on vehicle state, especially orientation, without requiring large datasets or repeated model inference.

Method: Uses a network to output a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere, predicting risk distribution for any approach angle using Fourier basis functions.

Result: Achieves a 91% success rate in simulation (vs. 73% baseline) and demonstrates real-world generalization.

Conclusion: SPARTA effectively addresses the computational and data challenges of angle-dependent traversability estimation.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of

introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed

spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset creation is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks diversity, especially in dynamic robotics scenarios like robot soccer.

Method: Uses photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats in Unreal Engine to generate synthetic annotated data, combining it with real-world data for enhanced performance.

Result: Synthetic datasets match real-world dataset performance and, when combined, significantly boost object detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, accurate alternative to manual annotation, ideal for robotics applications needing diverse training data.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct human testing of exoskeletons is risky and inconsistent, necessitating a safer, repeatable alternative.

Method: A bipedal robot with SDRE-optimized torque control and a parameterized method replicates human gait, adapting motor commands for precision.

Result: The method successfully replicates human gait, offering a reliable testing platform for exoskeletons.

Conclusion: The approach provides a safer, controlled environment for exoskeleton evaluation, reducing risks and improving repeatability.

Abstract: Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to
assist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible
exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a
safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal
robot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton
evaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation
(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait
replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum
model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human
motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized
control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively
replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping
trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear

Motivation: Understanding how information propagates in dynamic random graphs with varying protocols and graph dynamics.

Method: Uses strong stationary times for Markovian graphs and extends to non-Markovian dynamics via coupling from the past algorithms.

Result: Provides a framework to analyze completion times for both Markovian and non-Markovian graph dynamics.

Conclusion: Extends existing results to non-Markovian cases, offering broader applicability in studying rumor spreading.

Abstract: We study rumor spreading in dynamic random graphs. Starting with a single
informed vertex, the information flows until it reaches all the vertices of the
graph (completion), according to the following process. At each step $k$, the
information is propagated to neighbors of the informed vertices, in the $k$-th
generated random graph. The way this information propagates from vertex to
vertex at each step will depend on the ``protocol". We provide a method based
on strong stationary times to study the completion time when the graphs are
Markovian time dependent, using known results of the literature for independent
graphs. The concept of strong stationary times is then extended to
non-Markovian Dynamics using coupling from the past algorithms. This allows to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize positive-depth Deligne-Lusztig induction for unramified elliptic pairs and its connections to L-packets and orbital integrals.

Method: Uses a litmus test characterization theorem, compares Green functions from Yu's construction and Deligne-Lusztig induction, and applies results to the Springer hypothesis.

Result: Shows geometric realization of Kaletha's L-packets, proves a comparison result for arbitrary θ, and validates the positive-depth Springer hypothesis.

Conclusion: The findings offer geometric insights into L-packets and orbital integrals, with potential for future small-p applications.

Abstract: Under a largeness assumption on the size of the residue field, we give an
explicit description of the positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction of
unramified elliptic pairs $(T,\theta)$. When $\theta$ is regular, we show that
positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction gives a geometric realization of
Kaletha's Howe-unramified regular $L$-packets. This is obtained as an immediate

foresee will have interesting future applications to small-$p$ constructions.
We next define and analyze Green functions of two different origins: Yu's
construction (algebra) and positive-depth Deligne--Lusztig induction
(geometry). Using this, we deduce a comparison result for arbitrary $\theta$
from the regular setting. As a further application of our comparison

TL;DR: The paper examines the usability of publicly available NLP instruments for measuring representational harms in LLM-based systems, finding misalignment with practitioner needs and practical barriers to adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing NLP instruments for measuring representational harms meet the needs of practitioners evaluating LLM-based systems.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners to evaluate the usability and alignment of available instruments.

Result: Practitioners often cannot use these instruments due to misalignment with their needs or practical/institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to improve instrument alignment and usability, drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: The paper examines the usability of publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms in LLM-based systems, finding they often fail to meet practitioner needs due to misalignment or practical barriers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing tools for measuring representational harms in LLMs align with the needs of practitioners.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners to evaluate the usability and alignment of available instruments.

Result: Practitioners often cannot use these instruments due to misalignment with their needs or practical/institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to improve alignment and usability of instruments for practitioners, based on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

### [719] [Star decompositions via orientations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05194)
*Viktor Harangi*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: The paper provides a direct proof for the existence of $k$-star decompositions in random $d$-regular graphs for $k < d/2-1$, extending previous results and offering stronger conditions on star distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to generalize and strengthen earlier results on $k$-star decompositions in random $d$-regular graphs, providing a self-contained proof and prescribing star distributions under certain conditions.

Method: The authors use a direct, self-contained approach to prove the existence of $k$-star decompositions, focusing on the integer part $s$ of $d/(2k)$ and prescribing star counts per vertex.

Result: The paper shows that random $d$-regular graphs a.a.s. have $k$-star decompositions with $s$ or $s+1$ stars per vertex, and under stricter conditions, the set of vertices with $s$ stars can be prescribed.

Conclusion: The results extend and refine prior work, offering a more comprehensive understanding of $k$-star decompositions in random regular graphs.

Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into
$k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the
following problem: given $k \leq d/2$, does the random $d$-regular graph have a
$k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number
of edges is divisible by $k$)? Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and
Postle proved the a.a.s. existence for every odd $k$ using earlier results
regarding orientations satisfying certain degree conditions modulo $k$.
  In this paper we give a direct, self-contained proof that works for every $d$
and every $k<d/2-1$. In fact, we prove stronger results. Let $s\geq 1$ denote
the integer part of $d/(2k)$. We show that the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s.
has a $k$-star decomposition such that the number of stars centered at each
vertex is either $s$ or $s+1$. Moreover, if $k < d/3$ or $k \leq d/2 - 2.6 \log
d$, we can even prescribe the set of vertices with $s$ stars, as long as it is
of the appropriate size.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to generalize and strengthen existing results on $k$-star decompositions in random $d$-regular graphs, particularly for cases where $k$ is less than $d/2-1$.

Method: The authors present a self-contained, direct proof that ensures the existence of $k$-star decompositions with specific star distributions per vertex, leveraging integer parts of $d/(2k)$.

Result: The random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. has a $k$-star decomposition with $s$ or $s+1$ stars per vertex, and under stricter conditions, the set of vertices with $s$ stars can be prescribed.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes prior work, providing robust and flexible conditions for $k$-star decompositions in random $d$-regular graphs.

### [721] [CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449)
*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Canyuan He,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in using MLLMs for detecting out-of-context misinformation, proposes CMIE framework to improve accuracy by identifying deeper semantic links and filtering noisy evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with detecting deeper semantic relationships and are affected by noisy evidence in out-of-context misinformation detection.

Method: Proposes CMIE framework with Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) and Association Scoring (AS) to identify underlying relationships and filter evidence.

Result: CMIE outperforms existing methods in detecting out-of-context misinformation.

Conclusion: CMIE effectively addresses the limitations of MLLMs in misinformation detection by leveraging deeper semantic analysis and evidence filtering.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.
