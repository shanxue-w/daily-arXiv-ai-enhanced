Its usual replacement,\nthe $L_2$ star discrepancy, is smooth but exhibits other pathologies shown by\nJ. Matou\\v{s}ek. In an attempt to address these problems, we introduce the\n\\textit{average squared discrepancy} which averages over $2^d$ versions of the\n$L_2$ star discrepancy anchored in the different vertices of $[0,1]^d$. Not\nonly can this criterion be computed in $O(dn^2)$ time, like the $L_2$ star\ndiscrepancy, but also we show that it is equivalent to a weighted symmetric\n$L_2$ criterion of Hickernell's by a constant factor. We compare this criterion\nwith a wide range of traditional discrepancy measures, and show that only the\naverage squared discrepancy avoids the problems raised by Matou\\v{s}ek.\nFurthermore, we present a comprehensive numerical study showing in particular\nthat optimizing for the average squared discrepancy leads to strong performance\nfor the $L_2$ star discrepancy, whereas the converse does not hold."}

Exploiting ideas originating in our recent paper [4], we exhibit\nan optimal condition on the magnitude of the friction coefficient under which\nwe prove the existence of an absolutely continuous solution for arbitrary\nabsolutely continuous loads in the case of the most general 2D problem. We\nprovide examples showing that, when the condition is violated, spontaneous\njumps in time of the solution may occur, even when the load varies absolutely\ncontinuously in time. We argue that these spontaneous jumps in time of the\nsolution in the quasi-static problem reveal a transition of the process from a\nquasi-static nature to a dynamic nature, interpreted as the mathematical\nsignature of the onset of friction-induced vibrations in the elastodynamic\ncontact problem with dry friction."}

We\naim at considering solutions with infinite energy and we study the Cauchy\nproblem in the uniformly local spaces associated with the norm\n$$\\|u\\|_{L^2_{\\text{ul}}(\\mathbb{R},Y)}= \\sup_{a\\in\\mathbb{R}^d}\n\\|u(x)\\|_{L^2(B(a,1),Y)}.$$ For the classical parabolic equation, i.e. if\n$Y=\\mathbb{R}$, it is known that the Cauchy problem is ill-posed in the weak\nversion of the uniformly local spaces but well-posed in a stronger version,\nwhere additional uniform continuity is required. In this paper, we show that\nthe linear operator $\\partial^2_{xx} - B$ is not necessarily a sectorial\noperator in any version of the uniformly local Lebesgue space, due to the\npossible non-density of its domain. Then, we use the theory of parabolic\nabstract evolution equations to set a well-posed Cauchy problem, even in the\nweak version of the uniformly local space. In particular, we believe that this\npaper offers a new perspective on the comparison between both versions of the\nuniformly local spaces and also provides a new natural example of differential\noperators with non-dense domain."}

Secondly, an applicant is typically not\ninterested in a marginal coverage guarantee which averages over all possible\n(but not available) training data sets, but rather in a guarantee conditional\non the specific training data. This work tackles these problems by, firstly,\nshowing that full conformal prediction sets are conditionally conservative\ngiven the training data if the conformity score is stochastically bounded and\nsatisfies a stability condition. Secondly, we propose an approximation for the\nfull conformal prediction set that has asymptotically the same training\nconditional coverage as full conformal prediction under the stability\nassumption derived before, and can be computed more easily. Furthermore, we\nshow that under the stability assumption, $n$-fold cross-conformal prediction\nalso has the same asymptotic training conditional coverage guarantees as full\nconformal prediction. If the conformity score is defined as the out-of-sample\nprediction error, our approximation of the full conformal set coincides with\nthe symmetrized Jackknife.

In this work, we review\nthe axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three\nmain contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing\nexplicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full\nset of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more\nsources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a\nthree-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total\ninformation, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based\ndecomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources\nexceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its\ninconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and\nsynergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of\nrandom variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms\nsuch as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of\nhigh-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive\nexperiments on the Ising model.

Exogenous information is modelled via\nfiltration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the \"realised tree\", and\nan abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.\n  Based on this, a consistent model of \"rules\" is introduced, leading to the\nnotion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger\n(2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of\norder-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of\nstochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems\nformulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an\napproximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In\nthis formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis\nis essentially well-ordered.\n  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of \"extensive form characteristics\"\nis introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from\nwell-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence,\nwhich is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction\nbehaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is\ntackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a\nsuitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a\nnatural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory\napplies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing issues in\nFudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017) ."}

Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short\nin assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual\nnoise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,\nneither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent\nneural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential\ngeneralization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),\na novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation\nby exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical\npartitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural\nrelationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to\nnon-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,\nit shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely\nindicating when SCS has been altered.

In\nparticular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and\nDecision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align).
