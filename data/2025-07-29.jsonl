This in turn\nexacerbates the traffic congestion around schools, further compounding the\nproblem of long bus rides, creating a vicious cycle. It also results in\nunderutilized school buses and higher bus operating costs per rider. To address\nthese challenges, this paper focuses on the design of rural school bus routes\nand schedules, a particularly challenging problem due to its unique operational\ncomplexities, including mixed loading and irregular road networks. We formalize\na rural school bus routing and scheduling model that tackles these complexities\nwhile minimizing the total bus ride time of students. We develop an original\nroad network-aware cluster-then-route heuristic that leverages our problem\nformulation to produce high-quality solutions. For real-world case studies, our\napproach outperforms status quo solutions by reducing the bus ride times of\nstudents by 37-39 %. Our solutions also make the school bus more attractive,\nhelping address both the underutilization of school buses and the prevalence of\nprivate commutes. Our routing and scheduling approach can improve school bus\nuse by 17-19 % and reduce car trips that induce congestion near schools by\n12-17 %. Many rural school districts share the operational characteristics\nmodeled in this study, including long bus rides, high operational expenditures,\nmixed loading, and a high proportion of car-based school commutes, suggesting\nthe broad applicability of our approach.

Lower latency\nconstraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade\ndecoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system\nis considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its\nabundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically\ncapacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical\napplicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly\napplied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large\nspatial DoF.

Within\nthis framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization\nbehavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving\nproperty of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints\nand large spatial DoF.

An alternating\noptimization approach combines convex optimization for beamforming/phase shifts\nwith exhaustive search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for orientation.\nMajorization-Minimization-based algorithms solve subproblems iteratively.\nSimulation results show the framework achieves 24.1% rate improvement via\nexhaustive search and 20.0% via PSO over the non-rotatable RIS baseline, with\nPSO performance close to the exhaustive search upper bound, highlighting the\nbenefits of physical-layer multicast and orientation optimization."}

However, the\nincreasing dimensionality of these models -- in terms of both the number of\nagents and the size of their state space -- poses significant computational\nchallenges, particularly in the context of optimal control. In this work, we\npropose a scalable control frame work for large-scale ABMs based on a twofold\nmodel order reduction strategy: agent clustering and projection-based reduction\nvia Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).

However, it requires\ncomputationally expensive sequences of affine deformation followed by\nminimization of the potential energy to incrementally find the path in the\npotential energy landscape that corresponds to the correct solution trajectory.\nTherefore, we propose an athermal parallel stepping scheme that significantly\nimproves the computational time necessary to find the correct solution\ntrajectory using a multi-thread approach. Our approach proposes athermal\nstepping at two levels. Level I stepping provides a sequence of initial guesses\nat large increments by affine deformation of the system and land-marking anchor\npoints on the potential energy landscape. Level II stepping performs a set of\nindividual finely resolved athermal quasistatic deformation steps between the\ninherent structures of the initial level I guesses executed in parallel. The\nevaluated candidate trajectory is then verified by consecutively comparing the\nconfiguration of every last level II result with the corresponding inherent\nstructure of the level I guesses at the same strain states.

The key is a\nstrict consistency between the conserved variables and the geometric moments\n(i.e., the integrals of monomials) of every cut cell.

This type of\npermutation, when applied to the index of terms of a series, is defined to be\nboth convergence-preserving and \"fixing\" at least one divergent series, that\nis, rearranging the terms of any convergent series will result in a convergent\nseries, while rearranging the terms of some divergent series will result in a\nconvergent series. In general, if a divergent series can be fixed to converge\nin some way (it does not need to be by $\\lambda$-permutation), it is called a\n\"conditionally divergent series\". In 2006, another mathematician Daniel\nVelleman raised an open problem related to $\\lambda$-permutation: for a\nconditionally divergent series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n,n\\in \\mathbb{N},a_n\\in\n\\mathbb{R}$, let $S=\\{L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\colon L =\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{a_{\\sigma\\left(n\\right)}}$ $\\text{for some }\n\\lambda\\text{-permutation } \\sigma\\}$, can $S$ ever be something between\n$\\emptyset$ and $\\mathbb{R}$? This paper is devoted to partially answering this\nopen problem by considering a subset of $\\lambda$-permutation constraint by how\nwe can permute, named type R $\\lambda$-permutation.

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics."}

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics."}

We study a class of\nproblems where the objective function, evaluated at the PTO decision, is\nasymmetric with respect to estimation errors.

To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive\nfuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional\narchitecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding\nwindow to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction\nstrategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short\nand long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to\nautomatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships\namong them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require\nhuman involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce\ncalculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global\ncharacteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing\nredundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a\npartially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly\nmine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which\ngives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct\nsub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained\nlevel. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the\nmulti-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the\ncorresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with\nother competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the\nexperimental results."}

The problem is cast as a convex\nvariant of dynamic optimal transport, with additional nonlinear\ntemporal-spatial inequality constraints of momentum, modeled after the\nfundamental diagram from traffic theory. This constraint imposes a\ndensity-dependent upper bound on the admissible flux, capturing flow saturation\nand congestion effects, and thus leaves space for kinetic optimization. The\nformulation follows the Benamou-Brenier transportation rationale, whereby\nkinetic energy over density and momentum fields is optimized subject to the\nmass conservation law. We develop proximal splitting methods, namely the\nDouglas-Rachford and Chambolle-Pock algorithms, which exploit the separable\nstructure of the constraint set and require only simple proximal operations,\nand can accommodate additional (time-varying) spatial restrictions or\nobstacles.

The method represents the solution\nusing a neural network and imposes the boundary condition via a Lagrange\nmultiplier, based on a saddle-point formulation inspired by the classical Uzawa\nalgorithm. The scheme is mesh-free, compatible with automatic differentiation\nand extends naturally to problems with scattering and heterogeneous media. We\nestablish convergence of the continuum formulation and analyse the effects of\nquadrature error, neural approximation and inexact optimisation in the discrete\nimplementation.

Connections between DW shells and various\ngraphical descriptions, as well as gain and phase measures, are established\nthrough an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we examine\nthe relationships and relative conservatism among various separation\nconditions. A rotated Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) concept is proposed as a\nmixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion\nis derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D\ngraphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a\nreliable algorithm for visualizing the rotated SRGs and include an example to\ndemonstrate the non-conservatism of the proposed condition."}

Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the\nset points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage\neconomic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including\nphysics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The\nhierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In\nparticular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and\ncontinuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage\nsystems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day\nauctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no\nintra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to\nfollow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the\nwinter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation.\nFinally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the\nthermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by\nstatic battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging."}
