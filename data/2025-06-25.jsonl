This allows us to define defective resonances and associated\nexceptional points based on the geometric and algebraic multiplicities. Based\non the theory on holomorphic Fredholm operator-valued functions, we show\nfractional-order sensitivity of defective resonances with respect to operator\nperturbation. This property is particularly important in physics and associated\nwith intriguing phenomena, e.g., enhanced sensing and dissipation. A defective\nresonance is sought based on the perturbation analysis and Nystr\\\"om\ndiscretization of the boundary integral equation.

While UAV trajectory\noptimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it\nsuffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory\noptimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial\nreconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low\nenergy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel\nmanipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these\nparadigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted\nuniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential\ninformation to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper\n(Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems\nfor both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna\npositions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2)\nUAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF\nvectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct\noperational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages\nin low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its\nenergy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under\nresource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by\nleveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the\ncomplementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro\nmobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency,\nand deployment complexity in future wireless networks."}

To cope with the computational complexity of the model, we propose\na heuristic based on an Iterated Local Search (ILS) procedure coupled with a\nSet Partitioning problem. To further speed up the heuristic, we develop two\nlower bounds on the corresponding first-stage customer sequences.

In this work, we introduce a unified framework\nthat jointly optimizes both route choices and departure times to minimize\nsystem travel times. We formulate the problem as an optimization model and show\nthat our congestion model yields an unbiased estimate of travel times derived\nfrom a discretized version of Vickrey's bottleneck model. To solve large-scale\ninstances, we develop a custom metaheuristic based on a large neighborhood\nsearch framework. We assess our method through a case study on the Manhattan\nstreet network using real-world taxi data. In a setting with exclusively\ncentrally controlled AMoD vehicles, our approach reduces total traffic delay by\nup to 25 percent and mitigates network congestion by up to 35 percent compared\nto selfish routing. We also consider mixed-traffic settings with both AMoD and\nconventional vehicles, comparing a welfare-oriented operator that minimizes\ntotal system travel time with a profit-oriented one that optimizes only the\nfleet's travel time. Independent of the operator's objective, the analysis\nreveals a win-win outcome: across all control levels, both autonomous and\nnon-autonomous traffic benefit from the implementation of balancing and\nstaggering strategies."}

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an\nonline reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying\nMDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG\nmechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges\nto a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,\nand individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves\nguaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret."}

We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes.

Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality.

In this paper, we establish new results concerning two\nkey properties of $\\Pi(G)$: recognisability and purity. We demonstrate that\nrecognisability by the prime simplicial complex is strictly stronger than\nrecognisability by the prime graph. Notably, we present the first known example\nof a group that is recognisable by its prime simplicial complex and spectrum,\nbut not by its prime graph, and is not a direct product of two isomorphic\nsimple groups. Furthermore, we classify groups with pure prime simplicial\ncomplexes (i.e., all maximal simplices have the same size) across several\ninfinite families of finite simple groups. We also provide a partial\nclassification for non-abelian finite simple groups whose prime simplicial\ncomplex has maximal simplices of size at most 2."}

In such\nan application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly\nreliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered\ninoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball\ngraphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary\nconference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to\ndetermine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single\nvertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an\nefficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a\nlocation which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in\nmany swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often\ncontain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to\nimprove area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a\nlocation to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the\nreliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within\nsome fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high\nreliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a\nmodified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs."}

Soft\nhappy colouring of a partially coloured graph $G$ is the problem of finding a\nvertex colouring $\\sigma$ that preserves the precolouring and has the maximum\nnumber of $\\rho$-happy vertices. It is already known that this problem is\nNP-hard and directly relates to the community structure of the graphs; under a\ncertain condition on the proportion of happiness $\\rho$ and for graphs with\ncommunity structures, the induced colouring by communities can make all the\nvertices $\\rho$-happy. We show that when $0\\leq \\rho_1<\\rho_2\\leq 1$, a\ncomplete $\\rho_2$-happy colouring has a higher accuracy of community detection\nthan a complete $\\rho_1$-happy colouring. Moreover, when $\\rho$ is greater than\na threshold, it is unlikely for an algorithm to find a complete $\\rho$-happy\ncolouring with colour classes of almost equal sizes. Three local search\nalgorithms for soft happy colouring are proposed, and their performances are\ncompared with one another and other known algorithms. Among them, the\nlinear-time local search is shown to be not only very fast, but also a reliable\nalgorithm that can dramatically improve the number of $\\rho$-happy vertices."}

The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points\nare defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined\nas close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is\nmathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the\nsecond option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different\ndimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such\ncases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions.\nFor the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor\nexpanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance\nGIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\\ge 2$, and\nthat they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable\nconstant $C>0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least\n$(\\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of\nthe resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this\nexpansion factor is $\\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant\nfraction of the vertices. This has far-reaching consequences, since many\nalgorithms and mixing processes are fast on expander graphs."}

We begin by investigating this parameter for middle\ngraphs of several special graph classes, including path graphs, cycle graphs,\nwheel graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs,\nfriendship graphs, and double star graphs.
