In this paper, we construct a large class of such methods by combining finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) for spatial semidiscretization with symplectic integrators for time discretization. The resulting methods satisfy a local multisymplectic conservation law in space and time, which generalizes the symplectic conservation law of Hamiltonian ODEs, and which carries finer information about Hamiltonian structure than other approaches based on global function spaces. We give particular attention to conforming FEEC methods and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. The theory and methods are illustrated by application to the semilinear Hodge wave equation."}

Rare events are formulated as Bayesian inverse problems through a nonsmooth limit-state function whose zero level set characterises the event of interest. To overcome the nondifferentiability of this function, we propose a smooth approximation that preserves the failure set and yields a posterior distribution satisfying the small-noise limit. The resulting potential is sampled by ALDI, a (derivative-free) interacting particle system whose affine invariance allows it to adapt to the local anisotropy of the posterior.\n  We demonstrate the performance of the method across a hierarchy of benchmarks, namely two low-dimensional examples (an algebraic problem with convex geometry and a dynamical problem of saddle-type instability) and a point-vortex model for atmospheric blockings. In all cases, ALDI concentrates near the relevant near-critical sets and provides accurate proposal distributions for self-normalised importance sampling. The framework is computationally robust, potentially gradient-free, and well-suited for complex forward models with strong geometric anisotropy. These results highlight ALDI as a promising tool for rare-event estimation in unstable regimes of dynamical systems."}

Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation."}

The TTCD scheme reduces computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.

We distinguish our work from prior work by introducing the notion of information delay and by linking optimal implicit information sharing to the group delay of the retailer's ordering transfer function. We show that pure delay is strictly suboptimal, while fractional-delay mechanisms can reshape the order autocorrelation to improve supplier forecastability and reduce system-wide inventory costs. Using Hardy-space factorization, we develop a tractable family of invertible ARMA policies that approximates the theoretically optimal (but non-rational) limiting filter derived by Caldentey et al. (2025) and preserves its informational delay properties. This construction yields sharp guidance on how policy complexity, as measured by the degrees of the ARMA policies, impacts supply chain costs. We further extend the analysis to memory-constrained suppliers and characterize how the complexity of the retailer's policy should scale with the supplier's finite forecasting window, highlighting when, perhaps counterintuitively, increasing policy complexity can become counterproductive."}

For $Q$ a finite poset or $Q\\subseteq \\mathbb N^d$ an interval (i.e., a convex, connected subposet), we describe all minimal initial functors $F\\colon P\\to Q$ and in particular, show that $F$ is always a poset inclusion. We give efficient algorithms to compute a choice of minimal initial functor. In the case that $Q\\subseteq \\mathbb N^d$ is an interval, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on $|P|$, the number of relations in $P$ (including identities), in terms of the number $n$ of minima of $Q$: We show that $|P|=Θ(n)$ for $d\\leq 3$, and $|P|=Θ(n^2)$ for $d>3$.

Specifically, we characterize the limiting behavior of finite-dimensional marginals of the posterior. We establish that the posterior does not contract in this setting. Yet, the finite-dimensional posterior marginals converge to Gaussian tilts of the prior, where the mean of the Gaussian depends on the true signal coordinates of interest. Notably, the effect of the prior survives even in the limit of large samples and dimensions. We further characterize the behavior of the posterior mean and demonstrate that the posterior mean can strictly outperform the maximum likelihood estimate in mean-squared error in natural examples. Importantly, our results hold regardless of the sparsity level of the underlying signal. On the technical front, we introduce leave-one-out strategies for studying these marginals that may be of independent interest for analyzing low-dimensional functionals of high-dimensional signals in other Bayesian inference problems."}

For a strictly positive density on a simplex, we construct compatible face densities and an orthogonal decomposition of the quadratic polynomial space into face and interior components, which induces a natural face-interior block structure. A reduced Schur complement is identified that fully characterizes enrichment and well-posedness and provides a sharp spectral stability result. We show that this quantity coincides with the square root of the smallest eigenvalue of a low-dimensional symmetric positive definite operator. This matrix-based viewpoint yields simple spectral criteria for the invertibility of local moment systems and motivates spectrally preferable choices of face and interior bases with improved conditioning. Using the resulting degrees of freedom together with density and scaling parameters as design variables, we formulate a small eigenvalue optimization problem aimed at improving stability and reducing the condition number of the global reconstruction system. Three-dimensional experiments on uniform and quasi-uniform simplicial meshes illustrate the predicted stability, conditioning, and convergence behaviour of the enriched quadratic reconstruction."}

Preliminary version, comments welcome", "summary": "It is well known that limits can be computed by restricting along an initial functor, and that this can often simplify limit computation. We systematically study the algorithmic implications of this idea for diagrams indexed by a finite poset. We say an initial functor $F\\colon C\\to D$ with $C$ small is \\emph{minimal} if the sets of objects and morphisms of $C$ each have minimum cardinality, among the sources of all initial functors with target $D$. For $Q$ a finite poset or $Q\\subseteq \\mathbb N^d$ an interval (i.e., a convex, connected subposet), we describe all minimal initial functors $F\\colon P\\to Q$ and in particular, show that $F$ is always a poset inclusion. We give efficient algorithms to compute a choice of minimal initial functor. In the case that $Q\\subseteq \\mathbb N^d$ is an interval, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on $|P|$, the number of relations in $P$ (including identities), in terms of the number $n$ of minima of $Q$: We show that $|P|=Θ(n)$ for $d\\leq 3$, and $|P|=Θ(n^2)$ for $d>3$.

In this article, we propose several new completely positive reformulations for a class of POPs with linear inequality constraints. Our approach begins by lifting these problems into a novel convex optimization framework, wherein the variables are represented as combinations of symmetric rank-one tensors. Based on this lifted formulation, we present a general characterization of POPs with linear inequality constraints that can be reformulated as conic programs over the CPT cone. Additionally, we construct the dual formulations of the resulting completely positive programs.

By stacking the time-series transition matrices into a third-order tensor, the sparse Tucker decomposition is employed to characterize important interactions within the transition third-order tensor and reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, the graph regularization is employed to measure the local consistency of the response, predictor and temporal factor matrices in the vector autoregressive model.The two proposed regularization techniques can be shown to more accurate parameters estimation. A non-asymptotic error bound of the estimator of the proposed method is established, which is lower than those of the existing matrix or tensor based methods.

Binary neural networks (BNNs) have recently gained attention as energy and memory efficient models suitable for resource constrained environments; however, training BNNs exactly is computationally challenging because of its discrete characteristics. Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine. The numerical results indicate that the proposed regularisation terms modify training behaviour and yield improvements in classification accuracy on data not present in the training set."}

The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update.

In contrast to more familiar accounts of counterfactuals founded on causal models, we do not view interventions as a necessary component of a theory of counterfactuals. As an alternative to Pearl's celebrated ladder of causation, we view counterfactuals and interventions are orthogonal concepts, respectively mathematised in counterfactual probability spaces and causal spaces. The two concepts are then combined to form counterfactual causal spaces. At the heart of our theory is the notion of shared information between the worlds, encoded completely within the probability measure and causal kernels, and whose extremes are characterised by independence and synchronisation of worlds.

With this as the motivating starting point, we propose a new approach to the theory of stochastic economic equilibrium. Drawing on recent developments in probability theory, we argue for the relevance of the theory of large deviations in stochastic equilibrium economics. Thereby the formalism of stochastic equilibrium economics becomes analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics, as the theory of large deviations forms also the mathematical basis of statistical mechanics.

In particular, the observed value for an economic equilibrium may deviate significantly from its model-based a priori expected value. Mathematically, the a posteriori observed equilibrium may then represent a large deviation in the sense that it falls outside the region of validity of the Central Limit Theorem. With this as the motivating starting point, we propose a new approach to the theory of stochastic economic equilibrium. Drawing on recent developments in probability theory, we argue for the relevance of the theory of large deviations in stochastic equilibrium economics. Thereby the formalism of stochastic equilibrium economics becomes analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics, as the theory of large deviations forms also the mathematical basis of statistical mechanics. In consequence, thermodynamic concepts such as entropy, partition function and canonical probability can be introduced in a natural way to stochastic equilibrium economics. We focus here on the economic analogs of two fundamental principles, the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Gibbs Conditioning Principle."}

In such ultra-high dimensional settings, traditional empirical process-based tests often fail due to the curse of dimensionality or their reliance on the asymptotic linearity and normality of parameter estimators--properties that may not hold under ultra-high dimensional scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we first extend the classic martingale transformation to ultra-high dimensional settings under mild conditions and construct a Cramer-von Mises type test based on a martingale-transformed, projected residual-marked empirical process for any projection on the unit sphere. The martingale transformation renders this projected test asymptotically distribution-free and enables us to derive its limiting distribution using only standard convergence rates of parameter estimators. While the projected test is consistent for almost all projections on the unit sphere under mild conditions, it may still suffer from power loss for specific projections. Therefore, we further employ powerful p-value combination procedures, such as the Cauchy combination, to aggregate p-values across multiple projections, thereby enhancing overall robustness. Furthermore, recognizing that empirical process-based tests excel at detecting low-frequency signals while local smoothing tests are generally superior for high-frequency alternatives, we propose a novel hybrid test that aggregates both approaches using Cauchy combination. The resulting hybrid test is powerful against both low-frequency and high-frequency alternatives. $\\cdots$"}

The network is trained to map this coarse approximation to a high-fidelity source reconstruction, effectively suppressing truncation artifacts and recovering fine-scale geometric details. To enhance computational efficiency and robustness, we propose a high-to-low noise transfer learning strategy: a model pre-trained on high-noise regimes captures global topological features, offering a robust initialization for fine-tuning on lower-noise data.

However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic. Beyond empirical designs, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation, proving the convergence of CoCo-Fed even under unsupervised learning conditions suitable for wireless sensing tasks. Extensive simulations on an angle-of-arrival estimation task demonstrate that CoCo-Fed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both memory and communication efficiency while maintaining robust convergence under non-IID settings."}

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances.

Vehicular admission control (VAC) strategies have emerged as a promising solution to alleviate congestion. By leveraging information and communication technologies, VAC strategies regulate vehicle entry into the network to optimize different traffic metrics of interest over space and time. Despite the significant development of VAC strategies, their stability at the presence of modelling uncertainty remains under-explored. This paper investigates the stability properties of a class of decentralized VAC schemes under modelling uncertainty. Specifically, we consider large-scale, heterogeneous urban traffic networks characterised by nonlinear dynamics and concave macroscopic fundamental diagrams with bounded uncertainty between flow, density, and speed. In this context, we examine a broad class of decentralized VAC dynamics, described by general nonlinear forms. Using passivity theory, we derive scalable, locally verifiable conditions on the design of VAC schemes, that enable stability guarantees in the presence of modelling uncertainty. Several examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed design framework. Our analytical results are validated through numerical simulations on a 6-region system, demonstrating their effectiveness and practical relevance."}

In the case of classical experiments, where $\\mathsf{E}$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra on some set $S$, i.e. a \\textit{classical }or\\textit{ distributive logic}, the answer is more and less known: the (complete) Boolean algebra on $S^κ$ generated by $\\mathsf{E}^κ$.

In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $π$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $π$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed."}

Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive sampling strategy consistently yields more stable and accurate ROMs than random sampling does under the same computational budget."}

In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence.

Its exponent appears in many areas of Mathematics and Physics. Quantum polylogarithms satisfy a holonomic systems of modular difference equations with coefficients in variations of mixed Hodge-Tate structures of motivic origin. If h is a rational number, the quantum polylogarithms can be expressed via multiple polylogarithms.

Moreover, when the deterministic external forcing terms are periodic in time, we demonstrate that the pullback measure attractors are also periodic. We also study the upper semicontinuity of pullback measure attractors as $(ε_1, ε_2, γ_1, γ_2) \\rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The main difficulty in proving the pullback asymptotic compactness of the NDS in $(\\mathcal{P}_{2}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2), d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)})$ is caused by the lack of compactness in infinite-dimensional lattice systems, which is overcome by using uniform tail-ends estimates. And the inherent structure of the Selkov system precludes the possibility of any unidirectional dissipative influence arising from the interaction between the two coupled equations, thereby obstructing the emergence of a dominant energy-dissipation mechanism along a single directional pathway."}

Unlike traditional approaches that primarily focus on rectangular modules and outer boundary constraints, our method explicitly incorporates structural restrictions that arise when realizing more complex module shapes within rectangular floor-plan representations. The framework is based on triangulated graphs and investigates how algorithmic graph theory techniques can be used to embed L and T-shaped modules while preserving prescribed adjacencies.\n  We show that not every triangulated graph admits such realizations and identify structural limitations that prevent the existence of the desired module geometries. To capture these limitations, we introduce a shape-preservation constraint that ensures module geometries cannot be altered through boundary deformation, as such changes would either increase the combinatorial complexity of neighboring modules or violate adjacency relationships.\n  We propose a linear-time construction algorithm based on a prioritized canonical ordering that realizes L and T-shaped modules in graphs containing at least one internal K4, or two internal K4 subgraphs satisfying specific existence conditions. The algorithm is simple, constructive, and directly implementable, making it suitable for practical floor-plan generation workflows. We conclude by discussing extensions to additional module shapes and broader classes of supporting graph structures."}

In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM).

Existing estimators use autocovariance kernels represented as large $G \\times G$ matrices, where $G$ is the number of grid points on which the functions are evaluated. In many recent applications, functions are defined on 2D and 3D domains, and $G$ can be of the order $G \\sim 10^5$, making the evaluation of the autocovariance kernels computationally intensive or even impossible. We use the theory of spectral functional principal components to derive our deep learning estimator and prove that it is a universal approximator to the spectral density under general assumptions. Our estimator can be trained without computing the autocovariance kernels and it can be parallelized to provide the estimates much faster than existing approaches. We validate its performance by simulations and an application to fMRI images."}

This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms."}

While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems."}

To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing.

In this paper, we show that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes due to better information propagation within clusters. This relationship is of interest for optimizing network design in applications such as social networks and intelligent transportation systems. We first quantify the network observability/controllability requirements, and then, through Monte-Carlo simulations and different case studies, we show how clustering affects these metrics.

In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).\n  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting Rényi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured Rényi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.\n  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting."}

Solar Cruiser represents a critical step in the advancement of large-scale solar sail technology and includes the innovative use of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs) as momentum management actuators. The coupled nature of these actuators has proven challenging in the development of a robust momentum management controller. Recent literature has explored the use of MPC for solar sail momentum management with promising results, although exact knowledge of the disturbance torques acting on the solar sail was required. This paper amends this issue through the use of a Kalman filter to provide real-time estimation of unmodeled disturbance torques. Furthermore, the dynamic model used in this paper incorporates key fidelity enhancements compared to prior work, including the Solar Cruiser's four-reaction-wheel assembly and the offset between its center of mass and center of pressure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy successfully manages angular momentum growth under slew maneuvers that exceed the operational envelope of the current state-of-the-art method. The inclusion of the disturbance torque estimate is shown to greatly improve the reliability and performance of the proposed MPC approach. This work establishes a new benchmark for Solar Cruiser's momentum management capabilities and paves the way for MPC-based momentum management of other solar sails making use of an AMT and/or RCDs."}

For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform."}

This allows us to show strong inequalities for the coefficients of Chow polynomials; we prove log-concavity for all posets of weak rank at most six and provide counterexamples to log-concavity for any higher rank. For ranked posets we recover an even stronger condition, showing that the differences between consecutive coefficients constitute a pure O-sequence."}

We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{dm,dn}$ torus link complements, which is a $d$-party pure quantum state, and analyze its large-party limit, i.e., $d\\to \\infty$ limit. We show that the entanglement measures in this limit will receive contributions only from the Abelian anyons, and non-Abelian sectors are suppressed in the large-party limit. Consequently, the large-party limiting value of the entanglement entropy has an upper bound of $\\ln |Z_G|$, where $|Z_G|$ is the order of the center of the group $G$. As an explicit example, we perform quantitative analysis for the simplest case of the SU(2) group and $T_{d,dn}$ torus link to obtain the large-party limit of the entanglement entropy. We further investigate the semiclassical ($k \\to \\infty$) limit of the entropies after taking the large-party limit for this particular example."}

We show that this is true for many classes of states, both pure and mixed. In particular, this is true for all initial states that are short-range entangled and close to the equilibrium state. We also point out a subtle distinction between weak and strong thermalization."}

For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels."}

The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\\frac{1}{2})G(\\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap."}
