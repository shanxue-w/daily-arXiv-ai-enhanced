The new framework leverages Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time\nintegrators to satisfy the asymptotic-preserving property across different\ndiscretization orders of accuracy. In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte\nCarlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method\nconstructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal\ndiscretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient\nvariance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in\nthe problem. The proposed method is particularly well-suited for hyperbolic\nsystems with stiff relaxation, kinetic equations, and low Mach number flows,\nwhere standard Multi-Level Monte Carlo techniques often encounter computational\nchallenges.

To ensure computational\nfeasibility, the integral limits are truncated, leading to a finite exponential\nsum representation of the kernel.

The result is a richer and more nuanced\nstrategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.\n  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all\n$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable\nstructure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n\n\\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes\nis driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit\nallowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a\nswitching move that reorders pairs.\n  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\\ --\nnow in ascending order\\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.\nWe further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has\nlength exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the\nZeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic\ngrowth, with $M(n) \\sim \\frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit\nlog-normal convergence in their move distributions.

In this paper we develop an\nalgebraic framework for \\emph{semi-local quantum electromagnetism} on finite\nCauchy lenses: a class of compact spacetimes with boundaries and corner. At the\nclassical level, we establish a decomposition of the reduced covariant phase\nspace into bulk closed-loop and surface sectors and demonstrate how the\ncovariant phase space approach relates to the Peierls bracket construction\ncommonly used in perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. Upon\nquantisation, we obtain a Weyl $C^{*}$-algebra of semi-local observables\ntransforming non-trivially under large gauge transformations (those with\nnon-trivial boundary contribution). To recover gauge invariance, we invoke the\nnotion of \\emph{quantum reference frames} (QRFs) and construct a relativisation\nmap, where we treat auxiliary surface degrees of freedom as QRFs for the large\ngauge transformations. The relativisation map is constructed directly on the\nlevel of $C^{*}$-algebras, making our construction state-independent.

We consider a system where a legitimate receiver and a passive\neavesdropper experience independent and uniformly distributed angular\ndirections over transmission blocks, with the base station receiving noiseless,\nunit-delayed feedback from both, under the per-symbol input cost constraints.\nWe establish a closed-form upper bound on the secrecy capacity, which is based\non the main channel between the base station and the legitimate receiver.\nMoreover, we propose a joint communication and adaptive sensing (JCAS) scheme\nand derive its achievable secrecy rate.

Building on the original Zeckendorf game\\ -- previously studied in the\ncontext of unordered multisets\\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must\nrespect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced\nstrategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.\n  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all\n$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable\nstructure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n\n\\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes\nis driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit\nallowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a\nswitching move that reorders pairs.\n  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\\ --\nnow in ascending order\\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.\nWe further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has\nlength exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the\nZeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic\ngrowth, with $M(n) \\sim \\frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit\nlog-normal convergence in their move distributions.

This contrasts with\nthe binary case, where the existence of infinitely many completely unclustered\nBWTs is still an open problem, related to Artin's conjecture on primitive\nroots."}

This determinant representation points to an underlying integrable\nstructure, which we make explicit by showing that the observables satisfy a\nnonlinear differential-difference equation. We argue that the solution to this\nequation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform\ntranscendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are\nuniversal positive integers, independent of the particular observable,\nsuggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show\nthat the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative\ncombinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating\nfunction) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain.\nThis correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a\nricher family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory."}

The\nassumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG)\nand that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of\nclosed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter\n$p\\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm\nfrom 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly\namenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.\n  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal\nlattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in\n1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\\in\n[1,2]$ and $x\\in [1/\\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured\nto be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven\nin such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop\nO(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to\nquenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models."}

In this paper, we investigate linear perfect codes in the\nsum-rank metric. We analyze the geometry of balls and derive bounds on their\nvolumes, showing how the sphere-packing bound applies.

We present a graph-theoretic method to\nmeasure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a\ndirected multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent\nreachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a\nprobabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\\pi(s)$ for each service.\nThis allows us to iteratively compute a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix\nthat captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived\nfrom this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the\naverage probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets\n(0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage\nof assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive control (SSH\n22, RDP 3389) gets higher $\\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL\n1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized\nenterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest\nLMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\\&CK (TA0008:\nLateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates\n(micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral movement\nsusceptibility and shrink blast radius."}
