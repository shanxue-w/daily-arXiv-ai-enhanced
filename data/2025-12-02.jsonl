No figures", "summary": "This paper develops a Mellin-Laplace analytic framework for the fixed-shift prime correlation r_h(n) = Lambda(n) Lambda(n+h) for h not equal to 0. This sequence has no multiplicative structure, no Euler product, and no singularity at s = 1.\n  For every compactly supported Mellin-Laplace admissible kernel W, the smoothed shifted sum S_{W,h}(N) admits an absolutely convergent Mellin representation that holds entirely in the half-plane Re(s) > 1, with no use of analytic continuation.\n  The Mellin transform of W provides quantitative vertical decay, enabling full contour control on the boundary line Re(s) = 1 + eps. A Tauberian boundary analysis shows that both components of the boundary integral grow like N^{1+eps}, while the oscillatory part contributes an unavoidable N^{1+eps} (log N)^2 term. As a result, the boundary integral cannot be decomposed into a dominant main term plus a smaller error term, revealing a structural obstruction to main-term extraction for fixed-shift correlations.\n  These results give a complete analytic description of shifted prime correlations in their natural domain of convergence and clarify the analytic difficulties underlying problems such as the twin prime conjecture."}

The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schrödinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime."}

In this paper, we will generalize a recent theorem of G. Dosidis, B. Park, and L.

In so doing, we will witness how the combined use of shifted square and maximal functions causes a loss of sharpness; we, then, repair this through a trick, which allows us to remove the shift from the square functions, placing it purely on the maximal functions. As an application to our main theorem, we establish the boundedness of certain singular integrals with rough homogeneous kernels lying in the Orlicz space $L(\\log L)^α$ when restricted to the unit sphere.

At each step the operator is compressed along a chosen unit vector while remaining inside the positive cone, and the resulting map defines a monotone dynamical system on the cone of positive operators. We prove that the associated residuals admit a canonical telescoping decomposition into rank-one terms and a limiting positive operator, and we identify this limit together with an exact energy identity expressing the defect between the initial and limiting operators as a convergent series of rank-one contributions. In the case where the iteration exhausts the operator, the residual directions form a Parseval frame for the natural range space, yielding a constructive procedure that produces Parseval frames without spectral calculus. We further solve the inverse problem by characterizing those decreasing chains with rank-one steps that arise from such dynamics via an intrinsic normalization condition involving the Moore-Penrose inverse. For trace-class operators we obtain a scalar energy identity and show that mild greedy or density conditions on the chosen directions guarantee exhaustion. An application to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces illustrates the abstract results."}

It includes both the persistence diagrams and their weak limits. Our construction generalizes persistence landscapes to a measure-theoretic setting, preserving the intrinsic structure of persistence measures. We show that this vector summary is bijective and L^1-stable under mild assumptions, and that the original measure can be uniquely reconstructed. This approach gives a more faithful description of the shape of data in the limit and provides a stable, invertible way to analyze topological features in large systems."}

Classical decentralized gradient descent is appealing for its minimal state but fails to achieve exact consensus with fixed stepsizes unless additional trackers or dual variables are introduced. We revisit penalty methods and introduce a decentralized two-layer framework that couples an outer penalty-continuation loop with an inner plug-and-play saddle-point solver. Any primal-dual routine that satisfies simple stationarity and communication conditions can be used; when instantiated with a proximal-gradient solver, the framework yields the DP$^2$G algorithm, which reaches exact consensus with constant stepsizes, stores only one dual residual per agent, and requires exactly two short message exchanges per inner iteration. An explicit $\\ell_1$ penalty enforces agreement and, once above a computable threshold, makes the penalized and constrained problems equivalent. Leveraging the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property, we prove global convergence, vanishing disagreement, and linear rates for strongly convex objectives under any admissible inner solver. Experiments on distributed least squares, logistic regression, and elastic-net tasks across various networks demonstrate that DP$^2$G outperforms DGD-type methods in both convergence speed and communication efficiency, is competitive with gradient-tracking approaches while using less memory, and naturally accommodates composite objectives."}

In contrast to our previous work, we assume here that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold.

Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \\in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \\otimes_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules."}

However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets. Numerical simulations corroborate our findings."}

Multilevel methods exploit this hierarchy to accelerate convergence by combining coarse- and fine-level information, a strategy that has proven highly effective in the numerical solution of partial differential equations and related optimization problems. It turns out that many applications in PDE-constrained optimization and data science require minimizing the sum of smooth and nonsmooth functions. For example, training neural networks may require minimizing a mean squared error plus an $L^1$-regularization to induce sparsity in the weights. Correspondingly, we introduce a multilevel proximal trust-region method to minimize the sum of a nonconvex, smooth and a convex, nonsmooth function. Exploiting ideas from the multilevel literature allows us to reduce the cost of the step computation, which is a major bottleneck in single level procedures. Our work unifies theory behind the proximal trust-region methods and multilevel recursive strategies. We prove global convergence of our method in finite dimensional space and provide an efficient nonsmooth subproblem solver. We show the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm by means of numerical examples in PDE constrained optimization and machine-learning."}

To be published in MFPS 2025 proceedings", "summary": "Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.\n  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals."}

Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally étale property for a map $R \\to S$ of $\\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \\to S$ is formally étale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally étale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally étale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \\to S$ is b-nil formally étale. The b-nil formally étale property is quite different from the formally étale property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally étale algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally étale algebras exist over $\\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally étale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally étale implies b-nil formally étale in prime characteristic. The known cases mainly arise from the fact that a weakly étale map has isomorphic relative Frobenius. We record two additional cases that may be of interest. The first is for a map $R \\to S$ of $F$-finite rings such that $S$ has finitely presented absolute Frobenius. Secondly, we show that any formally étale map of Noetherian rings of prime characteristic is b-nil formally étale."}

Recently, we have extended this theory to the case of (real) even-dimensional Euclidean space. We provided several tools for studying slice regular functions in this context, such as a path-representation formula, slice-solutions, hyper-solutions and hyper-sigma balls. When adding an algebra structure to Euclidean space we have more properties related to the possibility of multiplying elements in the algebra. In this paper, we focus on exploring the properties specific to the context of the algebra of sedenions which is rather peculiar, being the algebra non associative and non alternative. The consideration of a non alternative algebra is a novelty in the context of slice regularity which opens the way to a number of further progresses. We offer an explicit characterization for slice-solutions and hyper-solutions, and we determine the convergence domain of the power series in the form $q\\mapsto\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}(q-p)^{*n}a_n$ with sedenionic coefficients.

Abstract shortened based on arxiv requirement", "summary": "Differential privacy is increasingly formalized through the lens of hypothesis testing via the robust and interpretable $f$-DP framework, where privacy guarantees are encoded by a baseline Blackwell trade-off function $f_{\\infty} = T(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ involving a pair of distributions $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$. The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.\n  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\\otimes n}, Q_n^{\\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \\log(dQ_{\\infty} / dP_{\\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy."}

The geometric regression model has a further classical approximation as a certain Gaussian white noise model with a transformed quantum spectral density as signal. In this sense, the result is a quantum analog of the asymptotic equivalence of classical spectral density estimation and Gaussian white noise, which is known for Gaussian stationary time series. In a forthcoming version of this preprint, we will also identify a quantum analog of the periodogram and provide optimal parametric and nonparametric estimates of the quantum spectral density."}

To illustrate the issues, recall that in the complex case it follows from standard arguments that the open disk of convergence cannot contain all the branch points of x unless the series represents a rational function. In the p-adic case, we show that the analogous assertion is not true in complete generality; but we also confirm it in a number of cases, for instance under the assumption that p is not smaller than the degree of s(x) over the field of rational functions of x.

However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves."}

In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions.

With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing."}

Aggregation generally loses the chronology of time steps, which renders the storage level representation challenging. Typically, this challenge is addressed by using representative days (RD) to utilize intra-day chronology, even though representative hours (RH) can describe the input time series more accurately at fewer representative time steps than RD. However, until now, the use of RH storage representation methods has been limited by either high computational complexity, poor accuracy in clustering and storage representation, or restricted applicability. Here, we present a novel storage representation method based on RH that combines the high accuracy of RH time series aggregation with the high computational efficiency of methods based on RD. Through benchmarking the four most established storage representation methods on a model of a net-zero European energy system, we find that the proposed method can reduce the solving time by over 95% for the same objective value compared to the most established RD and RH methods. The proposed method exhibits particular strengths at strong aggregations of around 100 to 500 representative hours per year, making the method especially applicable to large-scale and sector-coupled transition pathway models. The developed method for accurately modeling both short-term and long-term storage, along with the presented findings, is of practical relevance to energy system modelers who seek computational tractability in large-scale applications while avoiding the misallocation of storage and conversion capacities."}

However, full-digital architectures have prohibitive hardware costs, making hybrid analog-digital (HAD) designs the primary alternative. Nevertheless, such architectures compromise beamfocusing precision and lead to energy leakage, which exacerbates inter-user interference and increases eavesdropping risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field ISAC. For the first time, it exploits the common stream in RSMA to concurrently (i) flexibly manage interference, (ii) act as artificial noise to suppress eavesdropping, and (iii) serve as sensing sequences. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate while satisfying the angle and distance Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints. This results in a hard, non-convex optimization problem, and we employ block coordinate descent to decompose it into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. In the first stage of optimizing fully digital beamfocusers, we develop an iterative solution using weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE), quadratic transform, and Taylor expansion methods, thus avoiding conventional semidefinite relaxation.

The overarching problem is to understand how the various linear structures of a Banach space are preserved under certain nonlinear maps. The first chapters contain what are by now classical results to study the most basic and fundamental rigidity problems: the Lipschitz or uniform classification of Banach spaces. The other chapters form the main contribution of this book. The intended goal is to cover the work of many researchers, in particular their discoveries from the past 25 years, trying to understand how asymptotic properties of Banach spaces are preserved under several essential notions of nonlinear (bi-Lipschitz, coarse-Lipschitz, coarse or uniform) embeddings. This is part of a broader program called the Kalton program. This program, inspired by the Ribe program, seeks to uncover purely metric characterizations of asymptotic properties of Banach spaces. Many of these charaterizations are closely connected to the geometry of families of metric graphs (trees, Hamming graphs, diamond graphs, interlacing graphs) thus this book is also about the geometric structure of those graphs."}

To address this issue, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field communications with fully-connected or sub-connected HAD architectures. In the proposed scheme, the common stream is designed for dual purposes, delivering the desired message for legitimate users while acting as artificial noise to disrupt eavesdropping. The primary objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the analog beamfocuser, digital beamfocuser, and common secrecy rate allocation. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Specifically, the variables are partitioned into three blocks, where one block is solved via a surrogate optimization method, while the others are updated in closed form. Simulation results reveal that our transmit scheme: (1) approaches fully digital beamfocusing with substantially fewer radio frequency chains, (2) outperforms conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) preserves secrecy without significantly compromising communication rates."}

The system operates under transient forced convection with cooling air, presenting a challenging Moving Boundary Problem (MBP) characterized by intricate phase interface dynamics and strong geometrical dependencies. Conventional numerical methods for such Stefan problems face significant computational burdens due to repeated meshing requirements at the evolving interface. To overcome these limitations, we develop a multi-network PDDL approach that simultaneously predicts the solid phase temperature field, fin temperature distribution, and the moving phase boundary position. The architecture employs three specialized deep neural networks operating in parallel, constrained by the governing physical laws of energy conservation and interface conditions. Comprehensive validation against established analytical benchmarks demonstrates the framework's exceptional accuracy in predicting interface evolution and temperature distributions across various aspect ratios.

According to Hoff, McCormack, and Zhang [J. R. Stat. Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $Σ$ of $p_1\\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition may exist for rank-$r$ $Σ$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1<r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r>p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability.

A natural question is how toric promotion behaves under certain graph operations. In the main results of this article, we analyze the orbits of toric promotion under the bridge sum graph operation, which joins two graphs by adding an edge between a vertex of each graph. We show that the orbit length of toric promotion on any graph constructed via a bridge sum of a tree or a complete graph with a simple graph does not depend on the restriction of the initial labeling to the tree or complete subgraph. Additionally, we describe the orbit lengths of toric promotion on the bridge sums of two complete graphs and the bridge sums of a tree with a complete graph, and show that they do not depend on the initial labeling.

These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, nonlinear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state-action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-ReaVI, to solve this problem. We reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) the optimal routing policy is a monotonic handover policy that adapts to the availability of routes and their mean delays; and (ii) the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy, with at most \"N choose 2 + N\" breakpoints given N routes. Numerical experiments in a satellite-terrestrial integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance, or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI."}

Our main contribution is a mechanically-verified proof of strong normalization for a guarded fragment using a novel triple-lexicographic measure combining a phase bit, multiset ordering (Dershowitz-Manna), and ordinal ranking. From strong normalization, we derive a certified normalizer with proven totality and soundness. Assuming local confluence (verified through critical pair analysis), Newman's Lemma yields confluence and therefore unique normal forms for the safe fragment. We establish impossibility results showing that simpler measures, such as additive counters, polynomial interpretations, and single-bit flags, provably fail for rules with term duplication. The work demonstrates fundamental limitations in termination proving for self-referential systems. We state a conjecture: no relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods. Here \"relational\" is equivalent to \"capable of ordered computation\" - systems with a recursor enabling iteration over successors, comparison, or sequential counting. Such recursors necessarily redistribute step arguments across recursive calls, defeating all additive termination measures. This structural limitation applies to any TRS expressive enough to encode ordered data. All theorems have been formally verified in a proof assistant.

We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour. We also present new theoretical results regarding the i-SIR, such as the convexity of asymptotic variance in the number of proposals, which can be of independent interest."}

Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier."}

When the time parameter is of order one relative to the matrix size, we demonstrate that the second-order SFF grows logarithmically with the ensemble dimension. For the third-order SFFs, a closed-form result in a special case is obtained by exploiting the translational invariance of CUE."}

Code available upon request", "summary": "Ranking populations such as institutions based on certain characteristics is often of interest, and these ranks are typically estimated using samples drawn from the populations. Due to sample randomness, it is important to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated ranks. This becomes crucial when latent characteristics are poorly separated and where many rank estimates may be incorrectly ordered. Understanding uncertainty can help quantify and mitigate these issues and provide a fuller picture. However, this task is especially challenging because the rank parameters are discrete and the central limit theorem does not apply to the rank estimates. In this article, we propose a Repro Samples Method to address this nontrivial inference problem by developing a confidence set for the true, unobserved population ranks. This method provides finite-sample coverage guarantees and is broadly applicable to ranking problems. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated and compared with several published large sample ranking approaches using simulation studies and real data examples involving samples both from traditional statistical models and modern data science algorithms."}

The MFG framework enables the modeling of agents at a microscopic level as rational decision-makers who seek to optimize their utility, thereby translating complex microscopic behaviors into macroscopic models. We build upon this MFG framework to develop a mesoscopic-scale MFG model that defines the payoff and cost functions for a coordinator at each seaport considered in our study. The coordinator determines the routes taken by ships transporting goods between ports by evaluating several key factors: transportation costs, expected profit margins from loading specific goods at the seaports and unloading them at various destinations, and a congestion term that reflects the costs associated with accessing the destination port. We derive an explicit solution for the stationary version of the model under certain approximations and establish conditions necessary to ensure the uniqueness of the corresponding Mean Field Equilibrium (MFE). Furthermore, we introduce a statistical methodology to infer the parameters of the game from real-world data, specifically focusing on costs and the components of expected commercial margins. To validate our model in a real-world context, we analyze the ShipFix dataset of daily ''Dry Coal'' shipments worldwide from 2015 to 2025. Our discussion highlights the influence of empirical traffic flow on various components of costs. We believe that this research represents a significant advancement in the application of MFGs for effective maritime traffic management and offers valuable insights for practitioners in the field."}

Although the algorithmic framework parallels the Hermitian case, the theoretical analysis is substantially more complex since a non-Hermitian dual matrix may possess no eigenvalues or infinitely many eigenvalues. Besides, its eigenvalues are not necessarily dual numbers, leading to non-commutative behavior that further complicates the analysis. We first present a sufficient condition that ensures the existence of an eigenvalue whose standard part corresponds to the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the standard part matrix. Under a stronger condition, we then establish that the sequence generated by the power method converges linearly to the strict dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors. We also verify that this condition is necessary. The key to our analysis is a new Jordan-like decomposition, which addresses a gap arising from the lack of a conventional Jordan decomposition for non-Hermitian dual matrices. Our framework readily extends to non-Hermitian dual complex and dual number matrices. We also develop an adjoint method that reformulates the eigenvalue problem into an equivalent form for dual complex matrices. Numerical experiments on non-Hermitian DQMs are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the power method."}

Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Empirical results that corroborate the theoretical developments are presented and discussed throughout."}

Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks."}

Traditional production function estimations often rely on restrictive parametric models, failing to capture firm behavior under uncertainty. This research addresses these limitations by applying Hang K. Ryu's ME method to estimate production functions using World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) data from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, and India. The study normalizes entropy values to quantify heterogeneity and compares these measures with a Zonotope-based Gini index. Results demonstrate the ME method's superiority in capturing nuanced, functional heterogeneity often missed by traditional techniques. Furthermore, the study incorporates a \"Tangent Against Input Axes\" method to dynamically assess technical change within industries. By integrating information theory with production economics, this unified framework quantifies structural and functional differences across industries using firm-level data, advancing both methodological and empirical understanding of heterogeneity. A numerical simulation confirms the ME regression functions can approximate actual industrial heterogeneity. The research also highlights the superior ability of the ME method to provide a precise and economically meaningful measure of industry heterogeneity, particularly for longitudinal analyses."}

The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour.

The idea has been recently extended to isogeometric analysis, applying the construction of the spanning tree on the control mesh, or equivalently, on the Greville grid. In the present paper we extend the construction to hierarchical splines, a set of splines with multi-level structure for adaptive refinement, by constructing a spanning tree for each single level.

However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering."}

Next to a straightforward scaling heuristic, we introduce a novel exact transformation approach for the preprocessing of multi-objective binary problems. In this exact approach, the large or widely ranged integer objective coefficients are transformed into the minimal integer objective coefficients that preserve the dominance relation of the points in the objective space. The transformation problem is solved with an integer programming formulation with an exponential number of constraints.

If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs."}

To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation. Overall, the results provide a complete analytical and numerical framework for investigating the long-time statistical behaviour of the SCHE."}

Closely match published version, add missing reference", "summary": "Stochastic mechanics is regarded as a physical theory to explain quantum mechanics with classical terms such that some of the quantum mechanics paradoxes can be avoided. Here we propose a new variational principle to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This principle not only recovers Nelson's theory and consequently, the Schrödinger equation, but also clears an unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture for stochastic mechanics. Each path configuration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory. The structure of Lagrangian developed here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description of the dynamics of a physical system."}

Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter.

In such frameworks, computational efficiency is severely constrained by the CFL condition when addressing stiff problems, and they fundamentally conflicts with spatiotemporal coupled methods whose core advantage lies in embedding stiff source terms. By fully leveraging temporal derivatives of physical variables within a rigorously derived compact mathematical framework, the scheme achieves fourth-order temporal accuracy in only two stages. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for A-stability is established through systematic theoretical and numerical investigation, and a Newton iterative procedure is provided to accelerate convergence. Extensive numerical experiments on classical stiff problems confirm the method's effectiveness and competitiveness."}

These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners."}

Related to articles arXiv:2302.14619 and arXiv:2310.02274", "summary": "A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schrödinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincaré algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories."}

A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling."}

Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally étale property for a map $R \\to S$ of $\\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \\to S$ is formally étale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally étale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally étale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \\to S$ is b-nil formally étale. The b-nil formally étale property is quite different from the formally étale property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally étale algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally étale algebras exist over $\\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally étale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally étale implies b-nil formally étale in prime characteristic. The known cases mainly arise from the fact that a weakly étale map has isomorphic relative Frobenius. We record two additional cases that may be of interest. The first is for a map $R \\to S$ of $F$-finite rings such that $S$ has finitely presented absolute Frobenius. Secondly, we show that any formally étale map of Noetherian rings of prime characteristic is b-nil formally étale."}

We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability.

However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform."}

The proposed procedure, known as the $θ$-scheme with $θ\\in [0,1]$, unifies explicit and implicit time discretizations and is suitable for handling the nonlinear boundary feedback control problem. Using the discrete energy method, we prove that the proposed difference scheme is conditionally stable for $0 \\leq θ< \\frac{1}{2}$ and unconditionally stable for $θ\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$. In addition, we establish the exponential stability of the fully discrete solution. The error analysis shows a first-order convergence rate of the state variable in the discrete $L^{2}$-, $H^{1}$-, and $L^{\\infty}$-norms for $θ\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, while preserving the exponential stability property. A first-order convergence rate for the boundary control inputs is also obtained. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Neumann boundary feedback control of the viscous Burgers' equation."}

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity."}

In \"quantum kinetic theory\", the Schrödinger equation for the complex-valued \"wave function\" in the physical space is converted into the Wigner equation for the real-valued Wigner function in phase space (which can take negative values). The Wigner (\"Quantum Vlasov\") equation contains the transport term of classical kinetic equations plus a pseudo-differential operator containing the potential.

Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy."}

We combine time-domain integral equations, Laplace transforms, and Hardy-Sobolev space techniques to analyze this system, establishing its unique solvability in anisotropic Hilbert spaces, with solutions expressed as convergent Neumann series of convolution operators. We derive geometric decay of truncation errors for resonant incident waves and quantify the contribution of $N$-th order multi-scattering, showing it scales with \\(\\varepsilon^{N(1-p)+1}\\) (relating bubble radius \\(\\varepsilon\\) and inter-bubble distance scaling as $\\varepsilon^p$, $p<1$).

To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin.

However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.\n  In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \\textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime."}

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."}

The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel.

Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk."}

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs."}

Cross-diffusion effects are particularly relevant in the interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, in fact they play a key role in immune response dynamics and cannot be neglected.

To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference."}

In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$.

These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy."}

To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives.

These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations."}

In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation."}

The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space.

However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency."}

This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory."}

Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Empirical results that corroborate the theoretical developments are presented and discussed throughout."}

Algorithmic tools that can efficiently probe and analyze these cyclic topologies are increasingly vital for tasks in graph mining, network optimization, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. A core primitive for quantitative analysis of cycles is finding the Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC), representing the shortest cyclic path in a weighted graph. However, computing the MWC efficiently remains a challenge, particularly compared to shortest path computations. This paper introduces a novel deterministic algorithm for finding the MWC in general weighted graphs. Our approach adapts the structure of Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing and minimizing a \\textit{composite distance} metric, effectively translating the global cycle search into an iterative node-centric optimization. We provide a rigorous proof of correctness based on loop invariants. We detail two mechanisms for accelerating the search: a provable node discarding technique based on intermediate results, and a highly effective graph pruning heuristic. This heuristic dynamically restricts the search to relevant subgraphs, leveraging the principle of locality often present in complex networks to achieve significant empirical speedups, while periodic resets ensure global optimality is maintained. The efficiency of the proposed MWC algorithm enables its use as a core component in more complex analyses focused on cyclic properties. We illustrate this through a detailed application case study: accelerating the computation of the Loop Modulus, a measure of cycle richness used in advanced network characterization. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the runtime of the iterative constraint-finding bottleneck in this computation."}

Using Schatten $p$-norms and Lipschitz continuity arguments, we derive bounds on the approximation parameters of pushforward designs obtained from complex projective spaces, including simplices, mixed states, and quantum channels. In the mixed-state case, we refine the bounds by exploiting the symmetric subspace structure, leading to asymptotically tighter estimates. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results, showing near-optimality in low-dimensional scenarios."}

Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation."}

Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures."}

The time discretization employs a combination of the classical Newmark-$β$ scheme for the displacement and the midpoint scheme for the magnetization, applied in a decoupled fashion.

We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics."}
