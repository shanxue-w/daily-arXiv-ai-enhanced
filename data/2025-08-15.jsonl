Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps\n$x\\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In\nparticular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$.\nThis seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the\nconjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any\ncorrespondence between polynomials and positive integers.\n  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend\ntheir domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic\nintegers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that\ncorrespond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power\nseries.\n  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\\colon\nF_2[[q]]\\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$\notherwise, where $A,B\\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$.

We show that\n$T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the\norbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two\nfixed points.\n  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these\nconjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by\nreplacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic\ninteger. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could\nsettle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for\nboth $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$."}

We\nbegin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.\nThe first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select\nspreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency\nwhile maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred\nto as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the\ninput bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the\nother to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems.

This feature makes it an\nappealing candidate for simulations involving meshes with embedded interfaces\nand evolving geometries. However, the method can yield poorly conditioned\nstiffness matrices in such scenarios due to meshes having cut cells. We propose\na novel element agglomeration algorithm for the virtual element method to\naddress this issue. The agglomeration algorithm renders the VEM robust over\nplanar polygonal meshes, particularly on finite element meshes cut by immersed\ngeometries. The algorithm relies on the element stability ratio, which we\ndefine using the extreme eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrix. The\nresulting element agglomeration criterion is free from nebulous polygon quality\nmetrics and is defined independently of polygon shapes. The algorithm proceeds\niteratively and element-wise to maximize the minimum element stability ratio,\neven at the expense of degrading elements with better ratios. Crucially,\nelement agglomeration alters the number of elements, not the degree of freedom\ncount. The resulting method, which we label as CutVEM, retains node locations\nof cut elements unchanged, and yields discretizations that conform to embedded\ninterfaces. This, in turn, facilitates straightforward imposition of boundary\nconditions and interfacial constraints. Through detailed numerical experiments\nthat sample varied element-interface intersections, we demonstrate that CutVEM\nenjoys dramatically improved condition numbers of global stiffness matrices\nover the VEM. Furthermore, simulations of prototypical heat conduction problems\nwith Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on domains with immersed\ngeometries show that element agglomeration does not noticeably degrade solution\naccuracy and that CutVEM retains the VEM's optimal convergence rate."}

For this problem\nthe usual bootstrap $t$ has good coverage but provides intervals with long and\nhighly variable lengths. Those intervals can have infinite length not just for\ntiny $n$, when the data have a discrete distribution. The BC$_a$ bootstrap\nproduces shorter intervals but tends to severely under-cover the mean.\nBootstrapping the studentized mean with weights from a Beta$(1/2,3/2)$\ndistribution is shown to attain second order accuracy. It never yields infinite\nlength intervals and the mean square bootstrap $t$ statistic is finite when\nthere are at least three distinct values in the data, or two distinct values\nappearing at least three times each. In a range of small sample settings, the\nbeta bootstrap $t$ intervals have closer to nominal coverage than the BC$_a$\nand shorter length than the multinomial ootstrap $t$.

Additionally, MLT offers decoding speeds that\nare up to three times faster and significantly enhances processing performance.\nMLT also introduces new functionalities and is specifically designed to lay the\nfoundation for the next generation of map renderers, which we expect to\nentirely offload processing to the GPU, thereby overcoming the stagnation of\nMoore`s law."}

Czap and Hud\\'{a}k proved that $cr(G)\\le |V(G)|-2$ for any\n1-plane graph $G$ and equality holds if $G$ is an optimal 1-plane graph [The\nElectronic J. Comb}., 20(2),#P54 (2013)]. This paper aims to characterize\nmaximal 1-plane graphs $G$ achieving the maximum crossing number $|V(G)|-2$. We\nfirst introduce a class of quasi-optimal 1-plane graphs as a generalization of\noptimal 1-plane graphs, and then prove that for any maximal 1-plane graph $G$,\n$cr(G)=|V(G)|-2$ holds if and only if $G$ is a quasi-optimal 1-plane graph.\nMoreover, we prove that every quasi-optimal 1-plane graph is maximal 1-planar\n(not merely drawing-saturated). Finally, we present some applications of our\nmain results, including a disproof of an upper bound on the crossing number of\nmaximal 1-planar graphs with odd-degree vertices."}

We\nderive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with\nthe membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry.\nOur results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to\na wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios.

Liu et al. (2022a) addressed\nthese issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector\n($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of\nestimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \\leq d$, whilst overcoming\nboth limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees\nof DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =\n\\tilde{\\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching\nour upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the\nadvantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines."}

While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in\npairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited\ngeneralizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts\nhinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer\ntraining-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though\nthey often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large\n3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration\nvia Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework\nfor atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity\nmetrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without\nincurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a\ncentrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic\natlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we\ndemonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels\nannotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse\ndeformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape\nsynthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas\nmesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a\nflexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas\nconstruction and applications."}
