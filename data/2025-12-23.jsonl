This paper introduces the \\textbf{Orbit-Summability Fixed Point Criterion}, a novel, purely dynamical condition, and establishes its profound connection to \\textbf{Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem} in complete metric spaces.\n  Our criterion, which requires only that the total displacement along a single orbit be finite (the orbit-summability property), provides a practical and concrete tool for checking the existence of fixed points without relying on the construction of an abstract potential function.\n  We demonstrate that, under a minimal regularity assumption involving the function $f$ and the metric $d$, the Orbit-Summability Criterion is \\textbf{precisely equivalent} to Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem. This equivalence is conceptually significant as it creates a direct bridge between the geometric principle of \\textbf{dynamical gap summability} (akin to the core idea in Banach`s Contraction Principle) and the variational principle of Caristi.\n  As a direct consequence of this equivalence, the classical \\textbf{Banach Contraction Principle is recovered as a straightforward corollary}. The methodology is designed to merge key elements from the Banach proof (orbit convergence via summability) with the structural requirements of Caristi (majorization by a well-behaved functional), effectively providing a unifying framework for these fundamental results.

We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{>}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services."}

In this paper, we introduce a parallelization construction for welded link diagrams and show that it is well defined: if two diagrams represent equivalent welded links, then the corresponding parallel diagrams obtained by our construction are also equivalent. When the two parallel strands are given parallel orientations, the resulting diagram admits a checkerboard coloring, whereas if they are assigned opposite orientations, the diagram is almost classical. Our construction further yields a decomposition in which one component is a copy of the original diagram and the other is a diagram representing a trivial welded link. We also investigate quandle colorings and the fundamental quandle of the parallel diagram, deriving a presentation from that of the original diagram.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Barzilai-Borwein diagonal-type Quasi-Newton method (BB-DQN). Our key innovation is the use of a single, shared, and modified BB-type matrix, updated iteratively using function and gradient information, to approximate the Hessians of all objectives simultaneously. We theoretically demonstrate that this approximation matrix remains positive definite throughout the iterative process. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the BB-DQN method without convexity assumptions and prove its R-linear convergence under mild conditions.

Based on this result, we obtain explicit formulas for the following three conditioned two-component spanning forests $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_2)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_3)$, and $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_c)$.

In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \\emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples."}

The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities."}

For instance, membership in these spaces is typically required for transport maps in optimal transport theory and for stochastic processes in probability theory. Nonlinear Lebesgue spaces also arise naturally in applications such as medical imaging, where the physical signals at play often exhibit little regularity and take their values in nonlinear spaces. Yet, these spaces remain little studied in the literature, likely due to their lack of differential structure outside the case where mappings are valued in a linear space. This paper is the first in a series by the authors devoted to the study of geometric and analytic properties of nonlinear Lebesgue spaces. The present article exposes a systematic treatment of their measure-theoretic properties, unifying and refining scattered results from the literature while also extending classical results from the linear setting to this broader nonlinear framework -- including the characterizations of their completeness and their separability as well as the density of some of their subspaces: the spaces of simple, continuous and smooth mappings."}

By introducing the concept of prioritized intersections, we extend and unify previous work on the topic. Moreover, to enable the use of prioritized intersection in real-time applications, we propose an efficient solver for forming such intersections for polyhedral constraints. The solver in question is a tailored implementation of a dual active-set quadratic programming solver that leverages the particular problem structure of the optimization problems arising for prioritized intersections. The method is validated in a real-time MPC application for autonomous driving, where it successfully resolves six different levels of conflicting constraints, confirming its efficiency and practicality for control. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solver outperforms existing solvers for hierarchical quadratic programming, making it relevant beyond control applications."}

Since the seminal work~\\cite{MR834478}, a vast literature has emerged on the sufficient conditions for such CLTs.

Our theory is based on drift conditions, which also yield lower bounds on the rates of convergence to stationarity in various metrics.\n  The validity of the ergodic CLT is of particular importance for sampling algorithms, where it underpins the error analysis of estimators in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Although heavy-tailed sampling is of central importance in applications, the characterisation of the CLT and the convergence rates are theoretically poorly understood for almost all practically-used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In this setting our results provide sharp conditions on the validity of the ergodic CLT and establish convergence rates for large families of MCMC sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed targets. Our study includes a rather complete analyses for random walk Metropolis samplers (with finite- and infinite-variance proposals), Metropolis-adjusted and unadjusted Langevin algorithms and the stereographic projection sampler (as well as the independence sampler).

In this setting, both the cop and the robber move continuously along the edges, subject to upper bounds on their speeds. The cop has no knowledge of the robber's location and must choose a continuous path through the graph that is guaranteed to intersect the robber's trajectory at some point in time. We show that for every compact metric graph, there exists a constant s > 0 such that if the cop's speed exceeds s times the robber's speed, then the cop can guarantee capture."}

This paper develops a static, graphon level version of Bayesian predictive synthesis for random networks. At the graphon level we show that Bayesian predictive synthesis corresponds to the integrated squared error projection of the true graphon onto the linear span of the agent graphons. We derive nonasymptotic oracle inequalities and prove that least-squares graphon-BPS, based on a finite number of edge observations, achieves the minimax L^2 rate over this agent span. Moreover, we show that any estimator that selects a single agent graphon is uniformly inconsistent on a nontrivial subset of the convex hull of the agents, whereas graphon-level Bayesian predictive synthesis remains minimax-rate optimal-formalizing a combination beats components phenomenon. Structural properties of the underlying random graphs are controlled through explicit Lipschitz bounds that transfer graphon error into error for edge density, degree distributions, subgraph densities, clustering coefficients, and giant component phase transitions. Finally, we develop a heavy tail theory for Bayesian predictive synthesis, showing how mixtures and entropic tilts preserve regularly varying degree distributions and how exponential random graph model agents remain within their family under log linear tilting with Kullback-Leibler optimal moment calibration."}

In this paper, we aim to shift the paradigm in wideband LEO SATCOM from beam-squint as an impairment to beam-squint as an asset. Specifically, we put forth 3D rainbow BF employing a joint phase-time array (JPTA) antenna with true time delay (TTD) to intentionally widen the beam-squint angle, steering frequency-dependent beams toward distributed directions. This novel approach enables the satellite to serve its entire coverage area in a single time slot. By doing so, the satellite simultaneously receives uplink signals from a massive number of users, significantly boosting throughput and reducing latency. To realize 3D rainbow BF, we formulate a JPTA beamformer optimization problem and address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem through a novel joint alternating and decomposition-based optimization framework. Through numerical evaluations incorporating realistic 3D LEO SATCOM geometry, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed rainbow BF-empowered LEO SATCOM achieves up to 2.8-fold increase in uplink throughput compared to conventional BH systems. These results mark a significant breakthrough for 6G wideband LEO SATCOM."}

When vertices have observed ordering or embedding, such as geography in spatial and village networks, or anatomical coordinates in connectomes, learning where and at what resolution connectivity departs from a baseline is crucial. Standard models typically emphasize a single representation, i.e. stochastic block models prioritize coarse partitions, latent space models prioritize global geometry, small-world generators capture local clustering with random shortcuts, and graphon formulations are fully general and do not solely supply a canonical multiresolution parameterization for interpretation and regularization. We introduce wavelet latent position exponential random graphs (WL-ERGs), an exchangeable logistic-graphon framework in which the log-odds connectivity kernel is represented in compactly supported orthonormal wavelet coordinates and mapped to edge probabilities through a logistic link. Wavelet coefficients are indexed by resolution and location, which allows multiscale structure to become sparse and directly interpretable. Although edges remain independent given latent coordinates, any finite truncation yields a conditional exponential family whose sufficient statistics are multiscale wavelet interaction counts and conditional laws admit a maximum-entropy characterization. These characteristics enable likelihood-based regularization and testing directly in coefficient space. The theory is naturally scale-resolved and includes universality for broad classes of logistic graphons, near-minimax estimation under multiscale sparsity, scale-indexed recovery and detection thresholds, and a band-limited regime in which canonical coefficient-space tilts are non-degenerate and satisfy a finite-dimensional large deviation principle."}

This highlights a fundamental distinction between discrete and smooth settings, showing that curvature constraints in the discrete realm impose fewer restrictions. Our proof is constructive and, once recognised, entirely elementary. Yet this fundamental fact appears to have gone unnoticed in the existing literature."}

The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary."}

The standard result that angular indices $(\\ell,m)$ must be integers is shown to be a consequence of domain constraints -- regularity at both poles and single-valuedness in the azimuthal coordinate -- rather than a requirement imposed by Maxwell's equations themselves. We prove that, for the sectoral case $ν=m$, the function $\\sin^{m}θ$ exactly solves the angular eigenvalue equation for any real $m>0$, giving rise to a continuous dispersion curve. We demonstrate why non-sectoral modes (tesseral and zonal) appear only at isolated integer points on the full sphere, and show how boundary modifications such as cones and wedges convert these isolated points into continuous families of modes. Complete field solutions, wave impedances, and energy integrability conditions are derived. At the limiting point $(ν, m) = (0, 0)$, the electromagnetic field vanishes identically while the underlying Debye potential remains non-trivial -- a distinction with implications for mode counting that connects to longstanding questions in gauge theory and cavity quantization. Full-wave simulations validate the theoretical predictions with sub-percent accuracy.

In the smooth category, a classical result asserts that any closed smooth surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant Gaussian curvature must be a sphere, reflecting the strong rigidity of differential geometry. In contrast, the discrete setting, where curvature is represented as an angular defect concentrated at vertices, admits far greater flexibility. For instance, a flat torus can be realised as a polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with zero curvature at every vertex. We establish a general result: any closed surface, whether orientable or non-orientable and of arbitrary genus, can be realised in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a (possibly self-intersecting) polyhedral surface in which every vertex has the same angular defect. This highlights a fundamental distinction between discrete and smooth settings, showing that curvature constraints in the discrete realm impose fewer restrictions. Our proof is constructive and, once recognised, entirely elementary. Yet this fundamental fact appears to have gone unnoticed in the existing literature."}

We analyze the properties of LMEs from a data center's perspective in a 1493-bus Western Interconnection over one year of hourly operation. We find that LME characteristics create three distinct regions: the hydropower-dominated Pacific Northwest, with low and stable LMEs; the coal-heavy Intermountain West, containing often high LMEs; and the Sunbelt, where mixed generation leads to variable LMEs correlated with solar output. This characterization provides analytical guidance for data center emission reduction.

Such results have been established for simpler estimators (e.g., the Berry-Esseen Theorem), but are lacking for nonparametric estimators. I consider a simple but practical setting where the AIPW estimator based on a black-box nuisance estimator, with or without cross-fitting, is used to estimate the average treatment effect in randomized controlled trials. I derive non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen-type bounds on the difference between Wald-CI coverage and the nominal coverage.

This manuscript builds on previous work which was presented as Paper AAS 25-697 at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Boston, MA, August 10-14 2025", "summary": "In this paper, we present a bi-level optimal control framework for designing low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with robustness against missed-thrust-events. The upper-level (UL) problem generates a nominal trajectory assuming full control authority, while each lower-level (LL) problem computes the optimal recovery maneuver following a missed-thrust-event along the nominal solution. Under suitable regularity conditions ensuring uniqueness and smoothness of the LL response, the hierarchy admits a single-level reformulation by embedding the LL first-order optimality conditions within the UL constraints. We further establish a robustness certificate, which provides an upper bound on the maximum admissible missed-thrust-duration for which the structural assumptions remain valid for the LL problem. The bound depends explicitly on precomputable dynamical quantities along the nominal solution, enabling rapid evaluation over large ensembles without iterative solves. Numerical experiments show that while the certificate identifies when modeling assumptions are valid, it does not fully characterize recoverability after missed-thrust-events. A finite-horizon controllability-energy analysis is therefore used to interpret recovery beyond the theoretical bounds. Collectively, these results provide a deterministic, certifiable approach for incorporating robustness directly into trajectory design, replacing post-hoc margin allocation techniques with formal guarantees."}

We introduce a general, non-modal, proof-theoretic framework for deontic reasoning grounded in default logic. Its central feature is the notion of controlled sequent - a sequent annotated with sets of formulas (control sets) that prescribe what should or should not be entailed by the formulas in the antecedent. When combined with distinct extra-logical rules representing defaults and norms, these control sets record the conditions and constraints governing their applicability, thereby enabling local soundness checks for derived sequents. We prove that controlled sequent calculi satisfies admissibility of contraction and non-analytic cuts, and we establish their strong completeness with respect to credulous consequence in default theories and normative systems. Finally, we illustrate in depth how controlled sequent calculi provide a flexible and expressive basis for resolving deontic conflicts and capturing dynamic deontic notions via appropriate extra-logical rules."}

Math. 53 (2000), 432-483] under small amplitude periodic boundary conditions.

Our findings do not require a small-amplitude assumption, only an upper bound on the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. Notably, when the boundary is planar, our approach aligns with existing studies. Additionally, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, we derive a limiting-state system dependent on boundary geometric parameters.

While rank-based ZO algorithms enjoy strong empirical success and robustness properties, their theoretical understanding, especially under stochastic objectives and standard smoothness assumptions, remains limited. In this paper, we study rank-based zeroth-order optimization for stochastic functions where only ordinal feedback of the stochastic function is available. We propose a simple and computationally efficient rank-based ZO algorithm. Under standard assumptions including smoothness, strong convexity, and bounded second moments of stochastic gradients, we establish explicit non-asymptotic query complexity bounds for both convex and nonconvex objectives. Notably, our results match the best-known query complexities of value-based ZO algorithms, demonstrating that ordinal information alone is sufficient for optimal query efficiency in stochastic settings. Our analysis departs from existing drift-based and information-geometric techniques, offering new tools for the study of rank-based optimization under noise. These findings narrow the gap between theory and practice and provide a principled foundation for optimization driven by human preferences."}

However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \\textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers."}

This paper proposes a hybrid method which reconciles these two hitherto disconnected approaches. Appealing in its simplicity, our main result introduces a new universal limiting characterisation of extremes that eschews the customary requirement of a sufficiently large block size for the plausible block maxima-fit to an extreme value distribution. We advocate that inference should be drawn solely on larger block maxima, from which practice the mainstream peaks-over-threshold methodology coalesces. The asymptotic properties of the promised hybrid-Hill estimator herald more than its efficiency, but rather that a fully-fledged unified semi-parametric stream of statistics for extreme values is viable. A finite sample simulation study demonstrates that a reduced-bias off-shoot of the hybrid-Hill estimator fares exceptionally well against the incumbent maximum likelihood estimation that relies on a numerical fit to the entire sample of block maxima."}

The learnable scaling adjusts the amplitudes of the multiscale random Fourier features, while the cross-attention residual structure provides an input-dependent mechanism to emphasize the most informative scales. As a result, the proposed design accelerates high-frequency convergence relative to comparable baselines built on the same multiscale bank. Moreover, the attention module supports incremental spectral enrichment: dominant Fourier modes extracted from intermediate approximations via discrete Fourier analysis can be appended to the feature bank and used in subsequent training, without modifying the backbone architecture.\n  We further extend this framework to PDE learning by introducing a linear combination of two sub-networks: one specialized in capturing high-frequency components of the PDE solution and the other in capturing low-frequency components, with a learnable (or optimally chosen) mixing factor to balance the two contributions and improve training efficiency in oscillatory regimes. Numerical experiments on high-frequency and discontinuous regression problems, image reconstruction tasks, as well as representative PDE examples, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."}

In light of hardness results for sampling -- classical MCMC methods, even with tempering, can suffer from exponential mixing times -- a natural question is how to leverage additional information, such as a warm start point for each mode, to enable faster mixing across modes. To address this, we introduce Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS) that dispenses with the Gaussian approximation assumption. We prove the first polynomial-time bound that works in a general setting, under a natural assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to the others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point. Similarly to ALPS, we define distributions tilted towards a mixture centered at the warm start points, and at the coldest level, use teleportation between warm start points to enable efficient mixing across modes. In contrast to ALPS, our method does not require Hessian information at the modes, but instead estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo. This additional estimation step is crucial in allowing the algorithm to handle target distributions with more complex geometries besides approximate Gaussian. For the proof, we show convergence results for Markov processes when only part of the stationary distribution is well-mixing and estimation for partition functions for individual components of a mixture. We numerically evaluate our algorithm's mixing performance compared to ALPS on a mixture of heavy-tailed distributions."}

A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1,\\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity.

We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\\% and 235\\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user.

In an earlier work [AKK25], the authors and Kobler proved that locally chordal graphs can be characterized by having chordal local covers, by forbidding short cycles and wheels as induced subgraphs, and by the property that each of their minimal local separators is a clique. In this paper, we address the global structure of locally chordal graphs. The global structure of chordal graphs is given by the following characterizations: a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of subtrees of a tree, if and only if it admits a tree-decomposition into cliques. We prove a local analog of this characterization, which essentially says that a graph is locally chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of special subtrees of a high-girth graph, if and only if it admits a special graph-decomposition over a high-girth graph into cliques. We also prove that these global representations of locally chordal graphs can be efficiently computed.\n  This paper has two major contributions. The first is to exhibit for locally chordal graphs an ideal \"local to global\" analysis: given a graph class defined by restricted local structure, we fully describe the global structure of graphs in the class. The second is to develop the theory of graph-decompositions. Much of the work in this paper is devoted to properties of graph-decompositions that represent the global structure of graphs. This theory will be useful to find global decompositions for graph classes beyond locally chordal graphs."}

Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications."}

The partial mean-field limit dynamics is then given by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the followers, coupled to a controlled Itô-SDE governing the dynamics of the lead agents.

Classical time-varying parameter VARs (TVP-VARs) treat all series symmetrically and ignore this structure, while network autoregressive models exploit a given graph but usually impose constant parameters and stationarity. We develop network state-space models in which a low-dimensional latent state controls time-varying network spillovers, own-lag persistence and nodal covariate effects. A key special case is a network time-varying parameter VAR (NTVP-VAR) that constrains each lag matrix to be a linear combination of known network operators, such as a row-normalised adjacency and the identity, and lets the associated coefficients evolve stochastically in time. The framework nests Gaussian and Poisson network autoregressions, network ARIMA models with graph differencing, and dynamic edge models driven by multivariate logistic regression.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology that enables the transformation of any optimization problem with a known solution into an equivalent MDO problem. This equivalence holds for a large class of coupling functions, including non-linear ones. The proposed methodology exploits a ''link function'' that effectively eliminates the coupling variables from the MDO problem, without influencing the solution. This approach allows for the creation of benchmark problems with reference solutions, facilitating the comparison and evaluation of various MDO algorithms. Moreover, it is adaptable to scalable optimization problems, where the dimensions of the search and constraint spaces can be configured. We also present a variant tailored to linear coupling functions with constant coefficients sampled independently at random, for which we derive a closed-form solution to the coupling equations. For the sake of illustration, we put our approach into action on a multidimensional Rosenbrock problem, varying the number of disciplines and design variable sizes. This example showcases the versatility and applicability of our methodology in generating benchmark problems for MDO."}

Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns.

Focusing on the recent trend of Beyond-Diagonal (BD) RISs, two distributed designs of respective SWEs are presented. The first deals with a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) system operating within the area of influence of a SWE comprising multiple BD-RISs. A hybrid distributed and fusion machine learning framework based on multi-branch attention-based convolutional Neural Networks (NNs), NN parameter sharing, and neuroevolutionary training is presented, which enables online mapping of channel realizations to the BD-RIS configurations as well as the multi-user transmit precoder. Performance evaluation results showcase that the distributedly optimized RIS-enabled SWE achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance with low online computational complexity. The second design focuses on the wideband interference MISO broadcast channel, where each base station exclusively controls one BD-RIS to serve its assigned group of users. A cooperative optimization framework that jointly designs the base station transmit precoders as well as the tunable capacitances and switch matrices of all metasurfaces is presented. Numerical results demonstrating the superior sum-rate performance of the designed RIS-enabled SWE for multi-cell MISO networks over benchmark schemes, considering non-cooperative configuration and conventional diagonal metasurfaces, are presented."}

The approach projects standard finite difference or finite element discretization onto a global coarse space spanned by the lowest Dirichlet Laplacian eigenmodes, yielding an analytic reduced model that requires no training data and preserves coefficient heterogeneity through an exact Galerkin projection. The reduced solution is energy-optimal in the selected subspace and, for $H^2$-regular solutions, the truncation error associated with discarded modes satisfies a $\\sqrt{\\log M}/M$ decay in the $H_0^1$ norm. For uniformly stable reduced bases, the projected operator is well conditioned with respect to mesh refinement, and numerical experiments corroborate the predicted accuracy and demonstrate meaningful speedups over sparse direct solvers, with favorable performance relative to multigrid and deflation-based Krylov methods for heterogeneous coefficients in the tested setups."}

We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations."}

The goal here is to develop statistically principled methodology that is flexible in its applicability, computationally efficient, and insensitive to extreme data variation, thereby overcoming limitations facing existing approaches. To do so, we introduce and systematically study certain symmetric matrices, called Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices, whose entries are normalized rank statistics derived from an underlying independent and identically distributed sample of absolutely continuous random variables. These matrices naturally arise as the matricization of one-sample problems in statistics and conceptually lie at the interface of nonparametrics, multivariate analysis, and data reduction. Among our results, we establish that the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices admit asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations with explicit centering and scaling terms. These asymptotic results enable rigorous parameter-free and distribution-free spectral methodology for addressing two hypothesis testing problems, namely community detection and principal submatrix detection. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. Throughout, our findings are juxtaposed with existing results based on the spectral properties of independent entry symmetric random matrices in signal-plus-noise data settings."}

By leveraging the notion of proper alignment and the Schur complement, we reveal that the Gaussian EOT solution operates as a precise \\textit{spectral shrinkage}: the optimal coupling is uniquely determined by contracting the spectrum of the correlation operator via a universal scalar function. This geometric insight facilitates an algorithmic shift from iterative fixed-point schemes (e.g., Sinkhorn) to direct algebraic computation, enabling efficient multi-scale analysis, where a single spectral decomposition allows for the exact evaluation of entropic costs across arbitrary regularization parameters $\\varepsilon > 0$ at negligible additional cost.

In this paper, we recap the classical scenario reduction theory based on the distance of probability distributions and the optimal mass transportation problem.

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."}

Tailored to the BIST 100 index and validated through a case study of a major defense company in Türkiye, the framework fuses structured financial data, unstructured text data, and macroeconomic indicators to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness. It incorporates a hybrid suite of models, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, graph neural network (GNN), to deliver probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. The empirical results demonstrate high forecasting accuracy, with a net profit mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.03% and narrow 95% confidence intervals for key financial indicators. The risk-aware analysis indicates a favorable risk-return profile, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.25 and a higher Sortino ratio of 1.80, suggesting relatively low downside volatility and robust performance under market fluctuations. Sensitivity analysis shows that the key financial indicator predictions are highly sensitive to variations of inflation, interest rates, sentiment, and exchange rates. Additionally, using an intuitionistic fuzzy MCDM approach, combining entropy weighting, evaluation based on distance from the average solution (EDAS), and the measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (MARCOS) methods, the tabular data learning network (TabNet) outperforms the other models and is identified as the most suitable candidate for deployment. Overall, the findings of this work highlight the importance of integrating advanced machine learning, risk quantification, and fuzzy MCDM methodologies in financial forecasting, particularly in emerging markets."}

The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations."}

Here, 'nonlocal' means that the velocity of the conservation law depends on an integral term in space. Typically, the nonlocal term consists of integrating the solution in $L^{1}$, whereas here we will study the case when the solution is integrated in the $L^{p}$-norm. We consider even the case of the $L^{p}$ metric when $p\\in (0,1)$ and establish, for an initial datum which is uniformly bounded away from zero, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We then demonstrate that there are also solutions to the initial datum being zero under more restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we investigate the singular limit, i.e., what happens when the nonlocal kernel converges to a Dirac distribution. Indeed, for the one-sided exponential kernel, we recover the (entropy) solution of the corresponding local conservation law for all $p\\in(0,\\infty)$ with further restrictions for $p\\in(0,1)$. This generalizes the celebrated singular limit result for nonlocal conservation laws for $p=1$ significantly and showcases the robustness of the approximation of local conservation laws by nonlocal ones. We investigate also the monotonicity of the solution when assuming that the initial datum is monotone. Finally, we prove the convergence of solutions for $p\\rightarrow 0$ on a small time horizon, resulting in a different kind of nonlocal conservation law.

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder.

Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility.

This fully explicit coupling approach is a very simple scheme which allows much flexibility in the implementation and has a lower computational cost, making it quite attractive in practice since smaller linear systems need to be solved in order to obtain the solution for the whole coupled poroelastic system. Due to the appealing advantages of these methods, intensive research is currently being carried out in this direction, as in the present work. Although the application of this type of method is very common in practice, there exist only a few works devoted to their theoretical analysis. In this work, we consider the so-called explicit fixed-stress split scheme, which consists of solving the flow problem first with time-lagging the displacement term, followed by the solution of the mechanics problem. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence analysis of the explicit fixed-stress split scheme for Biot's equations. In particular, we prove that this algorithm is optimally convergent if the considered finite element discretization satisfies an inf-sup condition.

A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1,\\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data.

To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of Itô--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting."}

These size-effects typically manifest themselves as a strengthening of the response in a form summarized as \"smaller is stiffer\". Moreover, the dynamical behavior of mechanical metamaterials is very remarkable, featuring unique phenomena such as dispersive behavior and band-gaps where elastic waves cannot propagate over specific frequency ranges. In these frequency ranges, the wavelength becomes gradually comparable to the unit-cell size, giving rise to microstructure related phenomena which become particularly visible in the reflection/transmission patterns where an incident wave hits the metamaterial's interfaces. This raises the question of whether the static size-effects and dynamic reflection/transmission patterns are correlated.\n  In this work, we investigate the interaction of the static size-effects and the dynamic scattering response of mechanical metamaterials by employing the relaxed micromorphic model. We introduce a two-stage optimization procedure to identify the material parameters. In the first stage, the static material parameters are identified by exploiting the static size-effects through a least squares fitting procedure based on the total energy. The dynamic parameters are determined in the second stage by fitting the dispersion curves of the relaxed micromorphic model to those of the fully discretized microstructure. At this second stage, we assess the results obtained by fitting the dispersion curves in one and in two propagation directions, for both the relaxed micromorphic model (RMM) with curvature and its reduced counterpart (RRMM) without curvature.\n  The full abstract is presented in the paper."}

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511.

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows."}

Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of Itô--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework.

This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $λ(ρ)=ρ^β$ with $β> 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity."}

Recently it was observed that for each starting configuration the set of thresholds can be partitioned into a finite number of intervals such that the evolution of opinions does not depend on the precise value of the threshold within one of the intervals. So, we may say that, given a starting configuration of initial opinions, there is only a finite number of equivalence classes of bounded confidence processes (and an algorithm to compute them). Here we systematically study different notions of equivalence. In our widest notion we can also get rid of the initial starting configuration and end up with a finite number of equivalent bounded confidence processes for each given (finite) number of agents. This allows to precisely study the occurring phenomena for small numbers of agents without the jeopardy of missing interesting cases by performing numerical experiments.

In light of hardness results for sampling -- classical MCMC methods, even with tempering, can suffer from exponential mixing times -- a natural question is how to leverage additional information, such as a warm start point for each mode, to enable faster mixing across modes. To address this, we introduce Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS) that dispenses with the Gaussian approximation assumption. We prove the first polynomial-time bound that works in a general setting, under a natural assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to the others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point. Similarly to ALPS, we define distributions tilted towards a mixture centered at the warm start points, and at the coldest level, use teleportation between warm start points to enable efficient mixing across modes. In contrast to ALPS, our method does not require Hessian information at the modes, but instead estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo. This additional estimation step is crucial in allowing the algorithm to handle target distributions with more complex geometries besides approximate Gaussian. For the proof, we show convergence results for Markov processes when only part of the stationary distribution is well-mixing and estimation for partition functions for individual components of a mixture.

Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions."}

Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

In light of hardness results for sampling -- classical MCMC methods, even with tempering, can suffer from exponential mixing times -- a natural question is how to leverage additional information, such as a warm start point for each mode, to enable faster mixing across modes. To address this, we introduce Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS) that dispenses with the Gaussian approximation assumption. We prove the first polynomial-time bound that works in a general setting, under a natural assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to the others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point. Similarly to ALPS, we define distributions tilted towards a mixture centered at the warm start points, and at the coldest level, use teleportation between warm start points to enable efficient mixing across modes. In contrast to ALPS, our method does not require Hessian information at the modes, but instead estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo. This additional estimation step is crucial in allowing the algorithm to handle target distributions with more complex geometries besides approximate Gaussian. For the proof, we show convergence results for Markov processes when only part of the stationary distribution is well-mixing and estimation for partition functions for individual components of a mixture. We numerically evaluate our algorithm's mixing performance compared to ALPS on a mixture of heavy-tailed distributions."}

The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^α$ with $α\\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \\emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $α=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $α>2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $α\\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one."}

To do so, we introduce and systematically study certain symmetric matrices, called Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices, whose entries are normalized rank statistics derived from an underlying independent and identically distributed sample of absolutely continuous random variables. These matrices naturally arise as the matricization of one-sample problems in statistics and conceptually lie at the interface of nonparametrics, multivariate analysis, and data reduction. Among our results, we establish that the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices admit asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations with explicit centering and scaling terms. These asymptotic results enable rigorous parameter-free and distribution-free spectral methodology for addressing two hypothesis testing problems, namely community detection and principal submatrix detection. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence. Numerical experiments conducted on 12 datasets from the literature show that the proposed binary KLR approach achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and sparsity with respect to IVM, $\\ell_{1/2}$-based regularization for KLR, and SVM while retaining the advantages of providing informative estimates of the class membership probabilities."}

By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability."}

The goal here is to develop statistically principled methodology that is flexible in its applicability, computationally efficient, and insensitive to extreme data variation, thereby overcoming limitations facing existing approaches. To do so, we introduce and systematically study certain symmetric matrices, called Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices, whose entries are normalized rank statistics derived from an underlying independent and identically distributed sample of absolutely continuous random variables. These matrices naturally arise as the matricization of one-sample problems in statistics and conceptually lie at the interface of nonparametrics, multivariate analysis, and data reduction. Among our results, we establish that the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices admit asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations with explicit centering and scaling terms. These asymptotic results enable rigorous parameter-free and distribution-free spectral methodology for addressing two hypothesis testing problems, namely community detection and principal submatrix detection. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior."}

We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^α$ with $α\\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \\emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $α=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $α>2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $α\\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid.

A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erdős--Rényi random graphs, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks, and Barabási--Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover.

Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states."}

This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $Σ$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action."}

Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erdős--Rényi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erdős--Rényi random graphs, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks, and Barabási--Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erdős--Rényi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts--Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barabási--Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities.

Transport noise is important for geophysical fluid dynamics applications, as it takes into account the effect of small scales on the large scale dynamics. The main mathematical challenge is that we allow for the transport noise to act on the full horizontal velocity, therefore leading to a non-trivial turbulent pressure, which requires an involved analysis to obtain the necessary energy bounds. Both Stratonovich and Itô noise are treated."}

Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known Itô versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \\[\n  E_h^\\infty := \\Big(\\mathbb{E}\\max_{1\\le j \\le M}\\|U_{t_j}-u_j\\|_X^p\\Big)^{1/p} \\] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\\in [2,\\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h>0$ and final time $T=Mh>0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\\infty\\lesssim h\\sqrt{\\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\\infty \\lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included."}
