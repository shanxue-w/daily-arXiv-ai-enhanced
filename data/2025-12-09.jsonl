Our analysis requires a careful derivation of the dimension dependence of several fundamental tools in the theory of finite element methods, including the elliptic regularity, Bramble--Hilbert lemma, trace inequalities, and inverse inequalities. We further introduce a new quasi-interpolation operator into finite element spaces, a variant of the classical Scott--Zhang interpolation, whose associated constants scale polynomially with the dimension. Building on these ingredients, we prove a multilevel norm equivalence theorem and derive a BPX preconditioner with explicit polynomial bounds on its dimensional dependence. This result has notable implications for emerging quantum computing methodologies: recent studies indicate that polynomial dependence of BPX preconditioners on dimension can yield exponential speedups for quantum-algorithmic approaches over their classical counterparts."}

First, we construct the explicit polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) using a least-squares approach. Then, f is reconstructed by solving the degree-2 polynomial equation a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0 for any $x \\in [-1,1]$, where an index function is used to select the correct sign in the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula-based nonlinear approximation (degree-2 in f) outperforms classical orthogonal polynomial-based least-squares approximation (degree-0 in f) and rational approximation (degree-1 in f) for functions with sharp transitions or discontinuities. As a potential application, we apply the degree-2 representation to data denoising. Instead of relying on more complex \"edge-preserving\" metric-based optimization techniques, the smooth coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) enable effective least-squares-based denoising on the low-dimensional manifold described by the algebraic variety a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0. Denoising the index function, which determines the appropriate root to select, can be achieved using classical statistical or modern classification/clustering techniques. Numerical results and data denoising examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the degree-2 nonlinear approximation technique. The new nonlinear, quadratic formula-based representation also raises theoretical and numerical questions, including strategies for identifying numerically stable representations, developing optimal algorithms to construct the polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x), and achieving economical representation and denoising of the index function."}

We employ the quasi-invariant limit procedure to rigorously derive a nonlinear PDE on the half-line, which is a Fokker-Planck equation featuring the boundary value in the drift term. The PDE is supplemented with a nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition encoding conservation of total agents and wealth. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, which converges in relative entropy to the unique stationary state that is the Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential) distribution. We determine the $L^1$ convergence (up to subsequences) of the solution toward this equilibrium: this requires us to make a step forward with respect to established arguments of entropy decay for Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, our results, which bridge the discrete stochastic dynamics with a continuous deterministic evolution equation, provide a novel and influential wealth exchange model in a PDE framework, which opens up many new applicative scenarios and methodological analytical challenges."}

Each vertex is either healthy or infected, and each infected vertex independently infects each of its healthy neighbors at rate $λ$ and recovers at rate $1$. We study the contact process in the presence of additional intervention measures by introducing a third possible state for vertices, which we call isolated. Vertices may enter the isolated state either because of individual decisions or due to community-influenced decisions, which leads to two distinct models that we call the isolation model and the vigilance model, respectively. In the isolation model, infected vertices self-isolate at rate $α$. In the vigilance model, each healthy vertex causes each of its infected neighbors to isolate at rate $α$. Unlike the usual contact process, these models lack the key features of attractiveness and existence of a dual, which makes analyzing them more challenging. We study the persistence times of the infection on large, finite, degree-heterogeneous random graphs. We show that the infection in the isolation model persists for at least stretched exponential time in the size of the graph for all values of $α$ and $λ$. By contrast, in the vigilance model, for every fixed $α$ the persistence time of the infection exhibits a phase transition in $λ$: for small $λ$ the infection persists for at most a linear time in the size of the graph, while for large $λ$ the infection persists exponentially long. This contrast demonstrates that individual versus community-influenced isolation can substantially affect the persistence of an epidemic."}

We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems."}

The objective is to maximize the minimum rate by jointly optimizing frequency-dependent analog beamfocusing, frequency-independent analog beamfocusing, digital beamfocusing, and common rate allocation.

For dimension $3$ and hence for bigger ones, we construct an example in which the Hausdorff distance between different $F_r$ is always infinite."}

Each vertex is either healthy or infected, and each infected vertex independently infects each of its healthy neighbors at rate $λ$ and recovers at rate $1$. We study the contact process in the presence of additional intervention measures by introducing a third possible state for vertices, which we call isolated. Vertices may enter the isolated state either because of individual decisions or due to community-influenced decisions, which leads to two distinct models that we call the isolation model and the vigilance model, respectively. In the isolation model, infected vertices self-isolate at rate $α$. In the vigilance model, each healthy vertex causes each of its infected neighbors to isolate at rate $α$. Unlike the usual contact process, these models lack the key features of attractiveness and existence of a dual, which makes analyzing them more challenging. We study the persistence times of the infection on large, finite, degree-heterogeneous random graphs. We show that the infection in the isolation model persists for at least stretched exponential time in the size of the graph for all values of $α$ and $λ$. By contrast, in the vigilance model, for every fixed $α$ the persistence time of the infection exhibits a phase transition in $λ$: for small $λ$ the infection persists for at most a linear time in the size of the graph, while for large $λ$ the infection persists exponentially long. This contrast demonstrates that individual versus community-influenced isolation can substantially affect the persistence of an epidemic."}

We also identify two sharp obstructions to global approximation: (i) an Orlicz tail-mismatch condition that induces a strictly positive forward-KL gap, and (ii) structural restrictions, such as non-autoregressive Gaussian kernels, that force \"branch collapse'' in conditional distributions.

The Fourier pseudo-spectral method is limited to periodic domains and suffers from Gibbs oscillations in non-periodic problems. The Chebyshev method mitigates this issue but requires edge-clustered grids, which does not match the characteristics of many physical problems. To overcome these restrictions, we propose a B-spline-periodized Fourier (BSPF) method that extends to non-periodic problems while retaining spectral-like accuracy and efficiency. The method combines a B-spline approximation with a Fourier-based residual correction. The B-spline component enforces the smooth matching of boundary values and derivatives, while the periodic residual is efficiently treated by Fourier differentiation/integration. This construction preserves spectral convergence within the domain and algebraic convergence at the boundaries. Numerical tests on differentiation and integration confirm the accuracy of the BSPF method superior to Chebyshev and finite-difference schemes for interior-oscillatory data. Analytical mapping further extends BSPF to non-uniform meshes, which enables selective grid refinement in regions of sharp variation. Applications of the BSPF method to the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional shallow water equations demonstrate accurate resolution of sharp gradients and nonlinear wave propagation, proving it as a flexible and efficient framework for solving non-periodic PDEs with high-order accuracy."}

Unlike the majority of currently solved instances, which belong to a special class where all receivers with a certain side-information cardinality are either present or absent, we consider more general instances without this constraint. We devise a novel algorithm that constructs a decoding chain by iteratively adding a message that can be decoded by a receiver whose side information is already in the chain. If the decoding chain cannot proceed due to the absence of a receiver with the required messages, we skip a message by adding it to the chain regardless. We prove that a lower bound on the optimal broadcast rate is a function of the number of skipped messages, across all possible decoding choices of the receivers and any realisation of the algorithm for each decoding choice. While this result is not computationally feasible in isolation, it serves as a basis for deriving explicit lower bounds on the broadcast rate for specific classes of pliable-index-coding instances. These lower bounds depend on the number of absent receivers or the pattern of their side-information sets. Specifically, we explicitly characterise the optimal broadcast rate for instances with up to and including four absent receivers with any side-information pattern, as well as instances where the side-information sets are nested in particular ways."}

The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \\geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields."}

Wells"], "title": "Double Local-to-Unity: Estimation under Nearly Nonstationary Volatility", "categories": ["math.ST"], "comment": null, "summary": "This article develops a moderate-deviation limit theory for autoregressive models with jointly persistent mean and volatility dynamics. The autoregressive coefficient is allowed to drift toward unity slower than the classical 1/n rate, while the volatility persistence parameter also converges to one at an even slower, logarithmic order, so that the conditional variance process is itself nearly nonstationary and its unconditional moments may diverge. This double localization allows the variance process to be nearly nonstationary and to evolve slowly, as observed in financial data and during asset price bubble episodes. Under standard regularity conditions, we establish consistency and distributional limits for the OLS estimator of the autoregressive coefficient that remains valid in the presence of highly persistent stochastic volatility. We show that the effective normalization for least squares inference is governed by an average volatility scale, and we derive martingale limit theorems for the OLS estimator under joint drift and volatility dynamics. In a mildly stationary regime (where the autoregressive root approaches one from below), the OLS estimator is asymptotically normal. In a mildly explosive regime (where the root approaches one from above), an OLS based self normalized statistic converges to a Cauchy limit. Strikingly, in both regimes, the limiting laws of our statistics are invariant to the detailed specification of the volatility process, even though the conditional variance is itself nearly nonstationary. Overall, the results extend moderate-deviation asymptotics to settings with drifting volatility persistence, unify local to unity inference with nearly nonstationary stochastic volatility, and deliver practically usable volatility robust statistics for empirical work in settings approaching instability and exhibiting bubbles."}

The method we proposed here, solves the problem of early exercise by introducing a front-fixing technique that permits for efficient and accurate valuation of an American put option.

To facilitate the reliable navigation for cellular-connected UAVs, channel knowledge map (CKM) is considered a promising approach capable of tackling the non-negligible co-channel interference resulting from the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability of air-ground (AG) channels. Nevertheless, due to measurement constraints and the aging of information, CKM is usually incomplete and needs to be regularly updated to capture the dynamic nature of complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory design strategy in which UAV navigation and CKM completion are incorporated into a common framework, enabling mutual benefits for both tasks. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV deployed in an urban environment measures the radio information during its flight and completes the CKM with Kriging interpolation. Based on the method of grid discretization and spherical approximation, a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The problem falls into the category of combinatorial mathematics and is essentially equivalent to determining an optimum sequence of grid points to traverse. Through proper mathematical manipulation, the problem is reformulated as variants of two classic models in graph theory, namely the shortest-path problem (SPP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two navigation strategies based on the two different models are proposed and thoroughly compared based on numerical results to provide implementable methods for engineering practice and reveal the trade-offs between UAV navigation and CKM completion. Simulation results reveal that the proposed navigation strategies can quickly expand the Pareto boundary of the problem and approach the performance of fully-known CKM."}

This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.\n  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free."}

In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry."}

Comments highly appreciated!", "summary": "We develop a quantitative theory of Lipschitz harmonic functions (LHF) on finitely generated groups, with emphasis on the Lipschitz Liouville property, affine rigidity, and quasi-isometric invariance for groups of polynomial growth. On finitely generated nilpotent groups we prove an affine rigidity theorem: for any adapted, smooth, Abelian-centered probability measure $μ$, every Lipschitz $μ$-harmonic function is affine, $f(x)=c+\\varphi([x])$. For any finite generating set $S$ this yields a canonical isometric identification $$\n  \\mathrm{LHF}(G,μ)/\\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathrm{Hom}(G_{\\mathrm{ab}},\\mathbb{C}),\\qquad\n  \\|\\nabla_S f\\|_\\infty=\\max_{s\\in S}|\\varphi([s])|, $$ independent of the choice of centered measure. Next, for any finite-index subgroup $H\\le G$ and adapted smooth $μ$ we prove a quantitative induction-restriction principle: restriction along $H$ and an explicit averaging operator give a linear isomorphism $\\mathrm{LHF}(G,μ)\\cong\\mathrm{LHF}(H,μ_H)$, where $μ_H$ is the hitting measure, with two-sided control of the Lipschitz seminorms. For groups of polynomial growth equipped with SAS measures we then show that $\\mathrm{LHF}$ is a quasi-isometry invariant, and use this to construct coarse harmonic coordinates that straighten quasi-isometries up to bounded error. Finally, within the Lyons-Sullivan / Ballmann-Polymerakis discretization framework, we prove a quantitative discrete-to-continuous extension theorem: Lipschitz harmonic data on an orbit extend to globally Lipschitz $L$-harmonic functions on the ambient manifold, with gradient bounds controlled by the background geometry."}

Bulk elasticity is written in the language of Riemannian geometry, and the framework is extended to material surfaces by using the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Within this setting, surface kinematics, surface strain measures, surface material metric, and the induced second fundamental form follow naturally from the embedding of the material surface in the material manifold. The classical theory of surface elasticity of Gurtin and Murdoch (1975) is revisited and reformulated in this geometric framework, and then extended to anelastic bodies with anelastic material surfaces. Constitutive equations for isotropic and anisotropic material surfaces are formulated systematically, and bulk and surface anelasticity are introduced by replacing the elastic metrics with their anelastic counterparts. The balance laws are derived variationally using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. These include the bulk balance of linear momentum together with the surface balance of linear momentum, whose normal component gives a generalized Laplace's law. As an application, we obtain the complete solution for a spherical incompressible isotropic solid ball containing a cavity filled with a compressible hyperelastic fluid, where the cavity boundary is an anelastic material surface with distributed surface eigenstrains. The analytical and numerical results quantify the effects of surface and fluid eigenstrains on the pressure-stretch response and residual stress."}

First, we transform the CKLS diffusion to a CIR-type one via a smooth state-space mapping and the general Girsanov change of measure. This transformation enables the applications of existing inference tools for CIR processes while ensuring possibilities of transferring the resulting limit theorems back to the original probability space. However, because Feller's condition fails, many existing high-frequency likelihood-based procedures cannot be applied directly, since their discretization schemes approximate likelihood terms involving the reciprocal of the process by Riemann sums that are no longer well-defined once the paths are allowed to hit zero. Instead, we estimate the drift coefficient of the transformed CIR-type model via a procedure based on its positive Harris recurrence, which is valid in the high-frequency regime. Exploiting the drift-elasticity relationship implied by the CKLS--CIR transformation, with the help of an initial estimation, we obtain an estimator of the CKLS elasticity from the CIR drift estimator in the transformed model. This yields a closed-form estimator of the elasticity parameter with an explicit asymptotic variance. We establish its $p$-consistency, stable convergence in law, and asymptotic normality. Finally, we show that stable convergence in law is invariant under equivalent changes of measure, thereby guaranteeing that the Gaussian limit remains invariant under the original measure."}

Building on the normalization strategy introduced by Perdomo and Plaza for triangles, we construct a canonical representation of tetrahedra in a normalized space embedded in the product of the hyperbolic half-plane and the hyperbolic half-space model. This representation allows us to define the left and right refinement maps, $Φ_L$ and $Φ_R$, acting on the space of normalized tetrahedral shapes, and to study their iterative orbits as discrete dynamical systems. Using these maps, we show that the orbit of the space-filling Sommerville tetrahedron contains only 4 similarity classes, 3 of which form an attractive cycle corresponding to the orbit of the path tetrahedron. We also show that small perturbations of elements in those orbits still lead to finite orbits. In addition, we study small perturbations of the regular tetrahedron and show that their orbits are also finite. Extensive numerical exploration of orbits for the other types of tetrahedra suggests that the LEB algorithm does not produce degenerating tetrahedra. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for analyzing the shape evolution of tetrahedral meshes and offers a possible route toward an analytic proof of the non-degeneracy property for the tetrahedral partitions generated by the LEB refinements. This property is highly desired in e.g. the finite element methods (FEMs)."}

First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise."}

In the present note, we establish a connection between Ebenfelt's (Weak) SOS Conjecture and the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies.

In particular, we prove that this minimal rank is attained at the extreme points of a specific Newton-Okounkov body. Furthermore, if $A(z,\\bar z)$ is moreover diagonal, we demonstrate that the relevant extreme points are finitely many rational points, thereby reducing the verification of the conjecture to a computationally tractable problem.

This paper addresses the challenge of synchronizing two files, one of which is a subsequence of the other and related through a constant rate of deletions, using an improved communication protocol. Building upon prior work, we integrate advanced multi-deletion correction codes into an existing baseline protocol, which previously relied on single-deletion correction. Our proposed protocol reduces communication cost by leveraging more general partitioning techniques as well as multi-deletion error correction. We derive a generalized upper bound on the expected number of transmitted bits, applicable to a broad class of deletion correction codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline in communication cost. These findings establish the efficacy of the improved protocol in achieving low-redundancy synchronization in scenarios where deletion errors occur."}

In this work, we prove that several well-known relaxations can be unified under a common polyhedral-SDP framework, which arises by approximating the intractable cone by tractable intersections of polyhedral cones with the positive semidefinite matrix cone. Although effective in providing tight lower bounds, these relaxations become computationally expensive as the number of variables and constraints grows at the rate of $Ω(n^{2τ})$ with the relaxation order $τ$. To address this challenge, we propose RiNNAL-POP, a low-rank augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) tailored to solve large-scale polyhedral-SDP relaxations of POPs. To efficiently handle the $Ω(n^{2τ})$ nonnegativity and consistency constraints, we design a tailored projection scheme whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. In addition, we identify a hidden facial structure in the polyhedral-SDP relaxation, which enables us to eliminate a large number of linear constraints by restricting the matrix variable to affine subspaces corresponding to exposed faces of the semidefinite cone. The latter enables us to efficiently solve the factorized ALM subproblems over the affine subspaces. At each ALM iteration, we additionally carry out a single projected gradient step with respect to the original matrix variable to automatically adjust the rank and escape from spurious local minima when necessary. We also extend our RiNNAL-POP algorithmic framework to solve moment-SOS relaxations of POPs. Extensive numerical experiments on various benchmark problems demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of RiNNAL-POP in solving large-scale polyhedral-SDP relaxations."}

The system exploits the spatial diversity and coordination of distributed access points (APs) in a cell-free massive MIMO architecture to detect aerial passive targets. To evaluate sensing performance, we introduce two key metrics: age of sensing (AoS), capturing the freshness of sensing information, and sensing coverage. The proposed AoS metric includes not only the transmission delays as in the existing models, but also the processing for sensing and networking delay, which are critical in dynamic environments like drone detection. We introduce an ambiguity parameter quantifying the similarity between the target-to-receiver channels for two hotspots and develop a novel network configuration strategy, including hotspot grouping, AP clustering, and sensing pilot assignment, leveraging simultaneous multi-point sensing to minimize AoS. Our results show that the best trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage is achieved when the number of hotspots sharing the same time/frequency resource matches the number of sensing pilots, indicating ambiguity as the primary factor limiting the sensing performance."}

We have studied the completeness of the spectrum in terms of the Bethe roots for small lattice sizes and have computed the eigenstate momenta. We found that the spins of the low-lying excitations can have fractional values in accordance with predictions of the underlying conformal field theory.

The method builds upon equation-driven Galerkin ROMs constructed from vibration modes and modal-derivative companion vectors, while nonlinear reduced tensors are identified from standard finite element outputs. A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses."}

Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function."}

The paper then introduces a discretization strategy for the two-dimensional case that requires only two grids, thereby accommodating a wider range of systems, including those whose interconnection operators contain non-differential components, such as the Mindlin plate model."}

We derive optimal regularity results for two distinct models. The first model addresses the transverse oscillations of a fully thermoelastic plate, for which we prove that the associated semigroup is analytic. The second model considers a partially thermoelastic plate composed of two components: a thermoelastic component with nonzero temperature differences and an elastic component unaffected by temperature variations. For this model, we demonstrate that the semigroup \\( S(t) \\) belongs to the Gevrey class of order 4, provided the solutions are radial and symmetric. Both analyticity and Gevrey class membership are qualitative properties that intricately link regularity and stability, driven by robust dissipative mechanisms. These properties are significantly stronger than standard regularity conditions, such as belonging to the class \\( C^k \\) or a Sobolev space \\( H^s \\)."}

Johansson extended this result by showing the following: For a graph $G$ with $δ(G) \\geq (1/2+\\varepsilon)n$, in the random graph process constrained to the host graph $G$, the hitting times for minimum degree $2$ and Hamiltonicity still coincide with high probability.\n  In this paper, we extend Johansson's result to Berge Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs.

In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters.

In addition, the travel time has less variability with respect to preset schedules, and rapid lines are more efficient than slow modes operated by buses. When a new rapid transit line is constructed, it partially replaces the traffic of existing slow transit lines. As a consequence, some of the slow-mode lines have to be either canceled or their routes modified to collaborate properly with the new rapid transit line. This process is usually carried out in a sequential way, thus leading to suboptimal solutions.\n  In this paper, we consider an integrated model for simultaneously designing rapid and redesigning slow networks. The aim of the model is community-oriented, that is, to maximize the demand covered (or captured) by both modes. We present a mathematical programming formulation that is solved by using a specially improved Benders decomposition. For this purpose, we include a partial decomposition to speed up the computation. The computational experiments are done on a case study based on real data obtained from a survey of mobility among transportation zones in the city of Seville."}

In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry."}

While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning."}

In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an \"intertwinement.\" A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration."}

In particular, when both the number of customers and queues grow, the parameters of the marginal distribution depend on the global characteristics of the network and are explicitly computed from a quadratic equation that arises from the corresponding large-deviation rate functions.

These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators."}

A sparsity pattern is called structurally controllable for pair \\((k,q)\\) if it admits a controllable ensemble of \\(q\\) individual systems with at most \\(k\\) switches.

Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs.

These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.\n  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters.

Our test controls the Type I error rate, works with any hierarchical linkage without case-specific derivations, and simulations show it is substantially more powerful than existing selective inference approaches. To demonstrate the practical utility of our p-values, we develop an adaptive $α$-spending procedure that estimates the number of clusters, with a probabilistic guarantee on overestimation.

From this viewpoint, the CB method applies a volume-preserving projection to the map, systematically removing spurious compressible errors arising from time integration, interpolation, or from velocity fields that are only approximately divergence-free. This projection bends the characteristics toward the divergence-free space, preserving mass and geometric features of the advected fields, even in the presence of significant error. We demonstrate the method in both two and three dimensions using benchmark problems and for multiphase flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r>0$ and $r<0$) of the spacetime.\n  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.\n  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.\n  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities."}

The analysis identifies an intrinsic representation of this limit inside the operator range of the initial datum, which makes it possible to compare the nonlinear limit with the shorted operator of Anderson-Duffin-Trapp. The nonlinear flow always produces an operator dominated by the shorted operator, with equality precisely in the commuting regime. A global energy identity describes how mass is dissipated at each step of the iteration, and a factorized description localizes the gap between the nonlinear limit and the classical shorted operator."}

We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds.

In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\\bf Q}|R \\ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $Δω/ω$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics. Our results suggest that spatial curvature can serve as a tunable knob for ``vacuum engineering,'' offering measurable shifts in high-$Q$ cavities and plasmonic systems."}

Since most current simulation approaches are limited to case-by-case studies, every existing approach has its constraints and flaws; hence a general and efficient simulation approach is in demand. Our study sheds some light in this direction. The paper's contributions are bi-fold. First, reviews and improvements are made to some existing methods for simulating specific self-similar processes. Second, we propose a novel method to simulate a general self-similar process, where we use a modified inverse Lamperti transformation to transform self-similarity to stationarity. Successful applications are made to simulate fractional Brownian motion and sub-fractional Brownian motion."}

A long-standing difficulty in classical IRL is the non-uniqueness of the recovered reward: many reward functions can induce the same optimal policy, rendering the inverse problem ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework for Inverse Entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning that resolves this ambiguity by combining entropy regularization with a least-squares reconstruction of the reward from the soft Bellman residual. This combination yields a unique and well-defined so-called least-squares reward consistent with the expert policy. We model the expert demonstrations as a Markov chain with the invariant distribution defined by an unknown expert policy $π^\\star$ and estimate the policy by a penalized maximum-likelihood procedure over a class of conditional distributions on the action space. We establish high-probability bounds for the excess Kullback--Leibler divergence between the estimated policy and the expert policy, accounting for statistical complexity through covering numbers of the policy class. These results lead to non-asymptotic minimax optimal convergence rates for the least-squares reward function, revealing the interplay between smoothing (entropy regularization), model complexity, and sample size. Our analysis bridges the gap between behavior cloning, inverse reinforcement learning, and modern statistical learning theory."}

However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems."}

For fixed bright component particle numbers and a given soliton velocity, the nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons exhibit four distinct branches with different density profiles and phase distributions, comprising two positive mass branches and two negative mass branches. The energy-velocity dispersion relation of each pair of positive- and one negative-mass branches form a closed loop, resulting in two mutually independent loops for the soliton's overall dispersion. All soliton branches share a common maximal velocity, which is determined by the larger bright soliton particle number. Linear stability analysis shows that all these branches are stable against weak perturbations. Extending to an $N$-component Manakov system, the nondegenerate solitons have $2^{N-1}$ distinct branches, of which $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is positive mass and $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is negative mass.

However, acquiring high-resolution, high-fidelity functional flow data is costly and taxing for the patient. As a result, there is growing interest in using highly undersampled MRI data to reduce acquisition time and thus the cost, while maximizing the information gain from the data. Examples of such recent work include inverse problems to estimate boundary conditions of aortic blood flow from highly undersampled k-space data. The undersampled data is selected based on a predefined sampling mask which can significantly influences the performance and the quality of the solution of the inverse problem. While there are many established sampling patterns to collect undersampled data, it remains unclear how to select the best sampling pattern for a given set of inference parameters. In this paper we propose an Optimal Experimental Design (OED) framework for MRI measurements in k-space, aiming to find optimal masks for estimating specific parameters directly from k-space. As OED is typically applied to sensor placement problems in spatial locations, this is, to our knowledge, the first time the technique is used in this context. We demonstrate that the masks optimized by employing OED consistently outperform conventional sampling patterns in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and variance, facilitating a speed-up of 10x of the acquisition time while maintaining accuracy."}

To address this challenge, this work introduces a new tool from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that goes beyond classical information-theoretic measures. We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework."}

A key idea is to switch from the Eulerian representation of densities to their Lagrangian counterpart through vector fields that advect particles. This dual view introduces challenges, notably the non-uniqueness of Lagrangian vector fields, but also opportunities to craft density evolutions and flows with favorable properties in terms of regularity, stability, and computational tractability. This survey presents an overview of these methods, with emphasis on two complementary approaches: diffusion methods, which rely on stochastic interpolation processes and underpin modern generative AI, and optimal transport, which defines interpolation by minimizing displacement cost.

For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting."}

As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $Ω$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $Ω$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions. Furthermore, we show that a practical numerical realization of the abstract scheme reduces to the classical policy iteration algorithm. Numerical experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM."}

This paper classifies all $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions of all kinematical Lie algebras that do not depend on the spatial rotation generators as well as all iterated central extensions thereof (for codimensions $\\le3$). The Bargmann central extension of the Galilean algebra then appears as merely one term in a sequence of $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree; a similar situation obtains for the Newton-Hooke algebra and the static algebra, but not for the Carrollian algebra nor those kinematical Lie algebras that are not Wigner-İnönü deformations of a simple algebra.\n  The sequence of $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree then corresponds to a tower of $p$-form fields. After imposing conventional constraints, the zero-form field provides absolute time, and the higher-form fields are certain wedge products of the field strengths of the one-form (Bargmann) gravitational field. These then provide natural $(p-1)$-brane couplings to the corresponding non-Lorentzian gravities, which are found to produce velocity-dependent gravitational effects in the presence of torsion. The $L_\\infty$-algebraic cocycles also provide Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for the $(p-1)$-brane action, which require the introduction of doubled spatial coordinates that are reminiscent of double field theory, but which (in some cases at least, and given appropriate kinetic terms) do not result in doubled physics."}

The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \\geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure.

The control architecture relies on the offline precomputation of the controllable tube, i.e, a time-indexed sequence of controllable sets. Sets are represented using constrained zonotopes (CZs), which are efficient encodings of convex polytopes that support fast set operations and enable tractable dynamic programming in high dimensions. Online, we obtain a globally optimal control profile by solving a series of one-step optimal control problems. Our key contributions are: (1) free-final-time optimality: we devise an optimal horizon computation algorithm to achieve global optimality; (2) robustness: we handle stochastic uncertainty in both the state and control, with probabilistic guarantees, by constructing bounded disturbance sets; (3) resilience: we develop (i) an optimization-free approach to computing the instantaneous reachable set, i.e., the reachable set from the current state, to enable, for example, large/maximal divert maneuvers, and (ii) an approach to achieving maximal decision-deferral, i.e., maintaining reachability/divert-feasibility to multiple targets for as long as possible. By means of an autonomous precision landing case study, we demonstrate globally optimal free-final-time guidance, robustness to navigation and actuation uncertainties, instantaneous divert envelope computation, and maximal decision-deferral."}

We show that the revenue-optimal stage-2 rule is the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) mechanism, while stage-1 transfers implement the optimal screening of types and absorb information rents consistent with incentive compatibility and participation. By committing to VCG ex post, the pre-auction information game becomes a potential game, so equilibrium information choices maximize expected welfare; the stage-1 fee schedule then transfers an optimal amount of payoff without conditioning on unverifiable cost scales. The design is robust to asymmetric primitives and accommodates a wide range of information technologies, providing a simple implementation that unifies efficiency and optimal revenue in environments with endogenous information acquisition."}

As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure."}

Since its introduction, several variants such as sim-width and omim-width were developed, along with a linear version of these parameters. It was recently shown that mim-width and all these variants all paraNP-hard, a consequence of the NP-hardness of distinguishing between graphs of linear mim-width at most 1211 and graphs of sim-width at least 1216 [ICALP2025]. The complexity of recognizing graphs of small width, particularly those close to $1$, remained open, despite their especially attractive algorithmic applications.\n  In this work, we show that the width recognition problems remain NP-hard even on small widths. Specifically, after introducing the novel parameter Omim-width sandwiched between omim-width and mim-width, we show that: (1) deciding whether a graph has sim-width = 1, omim-width = 1, or Omin-width = 1 is NP-hard, and the same is true for their linear variants; (2) the problems of deciding whether mim-width $\\leq$ 2 or linear mim-width $\\leq$ 2 are both NP-hard.

Within this framework, the approximation of $v^*$ is cast as a collocation-type problem derived from verification conditions for optimality -- most prominently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- that uniquely characterizes $v^*$. As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $Ω$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $Ω$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions.

Prepared for the proceedings of the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24), Glasgow, 14-18 July 2025", "summary": "Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the \"KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative\" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a \"semi-direct action\" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the \"wave-mean flow\" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research."}

Standard approaches including the classical Functional Empirical Process (FEP), break down under such conditions, especially for distributions like Pareto, Cauchy, low degree of freedom Student-t, due to their reliance on finite-variance assumptions to guarantee asymptotic convergence. The TFEP approach addresses these limitations by trimming a controlled proportion of extreme order statistics, thereby stabilizing the empirical process and restoring asymptotic Gaussian behavior. We establish the weak convergence of the TFEP under mild regularity conditions and derive new asymptotic distributions for one-sample and twosample problems. These theoretical developments lead to robust confidence intervals for truncated means, variances, and their differences or ratios. The efficiency and reliability of the TFEP are supported by extensive Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to Senegalese income data. In all scenarios, the TFEP provides accurate inference where both Gaussian-based methods and the classical FEP break down. The methodology thus offers a powerful and flexible tool for statistical analysis in heavy-tailed and non-standard environments."}

This poses particular challenges for model-based energy system optimization, as the number of variables increases with the number of buildings under consideration. In the worst case, the computational complexity of the models experiences an exponential increase with the number of variables. Furthermore, within the context of heat transition, it is often necessary to map extended periods of time (i.e., the service life of systems) with high resolution (particularly in the case of load peaks that occur at the onset of the day). In response to these challenges, the aggregation of input data is a common practice. In general, building blocks or other geographical and urban formations, such as neighbourhoods, are combined. This article explores the potential of incorporating energy performance indicators into the grouping of buildings. The case study utilizes authentic data from the Neu-Schwachhausen district, grouped based on geographical location, building geometry, and energy performance indicators. The selection of energy indicators includes the annual heat consumption as well as the potential for solar energy generation. To this end, a methodology is hereby presented that considers not only the anticipated annual energy quantity, but also its progression over time. We present a full workflow from geodata to a set of techno-socio-economically Pareto-optimal heat supply options. Our findings suggest that it is beneficial to find a balance between geographical position and energy properties when grouping buildings for the use in energy system models."}

We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions. These results refine the spectral analysis of deformed integrable models. The stability of soliton-fermion configurations has direct implications for topologically protected states in quantum information and condensed-matter systems."}

Standard approaches including the classical Functional Empirical Process (FEP), break down under such conditions, especially for distributions like Pareto, Cauchy, low degree of freedom Student-t, due to their reliance on finite-variance assumptions to guarantee asymptotic convergence. The TFEP approach addresses these limitations by trimming a controlled proportion of extreme order statistics, thereby stabilizing the empirical process and restoring asymptotic Gaussian behavior. We establish the weak convergence of the TFEP under mild regularity conditions and derive new asymptotic distributions for one-sample and twosample problems. These theoretical developments lead to robust confidence intervals for truncated means, variances, and their differences or ratios. The efficiency and reliability of the TFEP are supported by extensive Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to Senegalese income data. In all scenarios, the TFEP provides accurate inference where both Gaussian-based methods and the classical FEP break down. The methodology thus offers a powerful and flexible tool for statistical analysis in heavy-tailed and non-standard environments."}

Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $ε$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence."}

Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs.

These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.\n  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters.

Meanwhile, control theory has identified several properties that are useful in analysis and control synthesis, such as dissipativity, monotonicity, energy conservation, and symmetry-preserving structures. We posit that merging system identification with such control-relevant or physics-informed properties can provide useful inductive bias, enhance explainability, enable control synthesis with provable guarantees, and improve sample complexity. We formulate system identification as an optimization problem where control-relevant properties can be enforced through direct parameterization (constraining the model structure to satisfy a desired property by construction), soft constraints (encouraging control-relevant properties through regularization or penalty terms), and hard constraints (imposing control-relevant properties as constraints in the optimization problem). Through this lens, we survey methods to learn physics-informed and control-relevant models spanning classical linear and nonlinear system identification, machine learning approaches, and direct identification through data-driven and behavioral representations. We also provide several expository examples that are accompanied by code and brief tutorials on a public Github repository.

This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.\n  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension.

We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified ``timescale band'', a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games."}

Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature.

Specifically, we consider Laurent polynomials in the positive orthant with fixed support and fixed coefficient signs. We provide a criterion to decide whether a given polynomial is copositive that is based in determining the intersection points of the signed discriminant and a path going through the coefficients of the polynomial. If the signed support satisfies a combinatorial condition termed nonseparability, we show additionally that this intersection consists of one point, and that tracking one path in homotopy continuation methods suffices to decide upon copositivity.\n  Building on these results, we show that any copositive polynomial with nonseparable signed support can be decomposed into a sum of nonnegative circuit polynomials, generalising thereby previously known supports having this property."}

We focus on the Generalized Projected Gradient Descent (GPGD) framework, which unifies traditional sparse recovery methods and modern approaches using learned deep projective priors. We extend previous convergence results to robustness to model and projection errors. We use these theoretical results to explore ways to better control stability and robustness constants. To reduce recovery errors due to measurement noise, we consider generalized back-projection strategies to adapt GPGD to structured noise, such as sparse outliers. To improve the stability of GPGD, we propose a normalized idempotent regularization for the learning of deep projective priors. We provide numerical experiments in the context of sparse recovery and image inverse problems, highlighting the trade-offs between identifiability and stability that can be achieved with such methods."}

The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schrödinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics."}

However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency."}

In particular, we show that if the $X$-Bakry-Émery-Ricci curvature $\\mathrm{Ric}_{X}$ is non-negative and the norm of $X$ decays to zero at infinity, then the manifold has the Liouville property for the $X$-Laplacian.

Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions."}

Motivated by both open-loop and adaptive neurostimulation protocols, we study two practically relevant input structures: periodic (repetitive) charge-balanced inputs and non-repetitive charge-balanced inputs. For each case, we derive novel reachability and controllability conditions. The theoretical results are further validated through numerical demonstrations of minimum-energy control input design."}

Our original strict algorithm reached 66-77% success by prioritizing minimal perceptual change ($ΔE \\leq 5.0$), optimizing for enterprise contexts where brand fidelity is paramount. However, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to serve the broader ecosystem of web developers who need accessible solutions even when strict perceptual constraints cannot be satisfied. We introduce recursive optimization (Mode~1) that compounds small adjustments across iterations, achieving 93.68% success on all color pairs and 100% success on reasonable pairs (contrast ratio $ρ> 2.0$), representing a +27.23 percentage point improvement. A relaxed fallback mode (Mode~2) handles pathological edge cases, reaching 98.73% overall success. Evaluation on 10,000 realistic web color pairs demonstrates that context-aware constraint relaxation, combined with absolute hue preservation, enables practical accessibility compliance while maintaining brand color identity. The median perceptual change remains zero across all modes (most pairs already comply), while the 90th percentile reaches $ΔE_{2000} = 15.55$ in Mode~1 -- perceptually acceptable when hue invariance preserves the essential character of the original color. The approach is deployed in CM-Colors v0.5.0 (800+ monthly downloads), providing developers with explicit control over the accessibility-fidelity trade-off appropriate to their context."}

Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{μν})$ containing a caustic $\\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics."}
