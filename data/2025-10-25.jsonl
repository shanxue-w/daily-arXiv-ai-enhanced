This task often amounts to testing the goodness-of-fit of a\ncandidate distribution while allowing for reasonable deviations from it. The\ntolerant testing framework provides a systematic way of constructing such\ntests. Rather than testing the simple null hypothesis that data was drawn from\na candidate distribution, a tolerant test assesses whether the data is\nconsistent with any distribution that lies within a given neighborhood of the\ncandidate. As this neighborhood grows, the tolerance to misspecification\nincreases, while the power of the test decreases. In this work, we characterize\nthe information-theoretic trade-off between the size of the neighborhood and\nthe power of the test, in several canonical models. On the one hand, we\ncharacterize the optimal trade-off for tolerant testing in the Gaussian\nsequence model, under deviations measured in both smooth and non-smooth norms.\nOn the other hand, we study nonparametric analogues of this problem in smooth\nregression and density models. Along the way, we establish the sub-optimality\nof the classical chi-squared statistic for tolerant testing, and study simple\nalternative hypothesis tests."}

This paper addresses tactical\nplanning of intermodal railroad operations by introducing a new problem that\nsimultaneously considers three consolidation processes and the management of a\nheterogeneous railcar fleet. We model the problem with a scheduled service\nnetwork design with resource management (SSND-RM) formulation, expressed as an\ninteger linear program. While such formulations are challenging to solve at\nscale, we demonstrate that our problem can be tackled with a general-purpose\nsolver when provided with high-quality warm-start solutions.

We\nevaluate the methodology on realistic, large-scale instances from our\nindustrial partner, the Canadian National Railway Company: a North American\nClass I railroad.

Different final colours of two vertices certify that no isomorphism\ncan map one onto the other. The number of iterations that the algorithm takes\nto terminate is its central complexity parameter. For a long time, it was open\nwhether graphs that take the maximum theoretically possible number of Colour\nRefinement iterations actually exist. Starting from an exhaustive search on\ngraphs of low degrees, Kiefer and McKay proved the existence of infinite\nfamilies of such long-refinement graphs with degrees 2 and 3, thereby showing\nthat the trivial upper bound on the iteration number of Colour Refinement is\ntight. In this work, we provide a complete characterisation of the\nlong-refinement graphs with low (or, equivalently, high) degrees. We show that,\nwith one exception, the aforementioned families are the only long-refinement\ngraphs with maximum degree at most 3, and we fully classify the long-refinement\ngraphs with maximum degree 4. To this end, via a reverse-engineering approach,\nwe show that all low-degree long-refinement graphs can be represented as\ncompact strings, and we derive multiple structural insights from this\nsurprising fact. Since long-refinement graphs are closed under taking edge\ncomplements, this also yields a classification of long-refinement graphs with\nhigh degrees. Kiefer and McKay initiated a search for long-refinement graphs\nthat are only distinguished in the last iteration of Colour Refinement before\ntermination.
