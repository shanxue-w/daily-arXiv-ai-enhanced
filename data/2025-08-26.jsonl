In this paper, we present\n\\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a\nclass of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump\nconditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout\nthe domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source\nevaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification\nwith reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be\nperformed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of\nthe Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we\nuse our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that\noutputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our\nsolution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our\nestimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\\mathcal{O}(1 /\n\\sqrt{\\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize\nnaturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that\nhave irregular geometry and in up to dimension six.

We pursue the\nfollowing question: what is the best way to quantify the deformation of space?\nThis important question could be viewed in a new paradigm after 1956, when John\nF. Nash, Jr. proved that a Riemannian manifold can be immersed isometrically\ninto an Euclidean ambient space of dimension sufficiently large. This important\ntheorem allowed to view the representation of space from its exterior, from an\noutside perspective. In 1968, S.-S. Chern pointed out that a key technical\nelement in applying Nash's Theorem effectively is finding useful relationships\nbetween intrinsic and extrinsic quantities characterising immersions. And such\nrelations seem to be rather few, at least few enough to present us with a\ntechnical challenge in applying Nash's Theorem. One technical difficulty is\npresented by the passing through the narrow gateway provided by Gauss'\nequation, and that's why in order to obtain some new results it might be useful\nto include additional natural conditions. A turning point in the history of the\nquestion we pursue was an enlightening paper written by B.-Y. Chen in 1993,\nwhich paved the way for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Riemannian\ninequalities between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities.

Our main theorem\nis a computation of the Balmer spectrum of this category in the case of a\ndiscrete valuation ring. We prove that it coincides with the spectral space\nassociated to a bounded distributive lattice of asymptotic equivalence classes\nof monotonic sequences of natural numbers. The proof of this theorem involves\nan extensive study of generation behaviour in the derived category of\npseudo-coherent complexes. We find that different types of generation are\nrelated to different asymptotic boundedness conditions on the growth of torsion\nin homology. Consequently, we introduce certain distributive lattices of\n(equivalence classes of) monotonic sequences where the partial orders are\ndefined by different notions of asymptotic boundedness. These lattices, and the\nspectral spaces corresponding to them via Stone duality, may be of independent\ninterest. The complexity of these spectral spaces shows that, even in the\nsimplest nontrivial case, the spectrum of pseudo-coherent complexes is vastly\nmore complicated than the spectrum of perfect complexes. From a broader\nperspective, these results demonstrate that the spectrum of a rigid\ntensor-triangulated category can expand tremendously when we pass to a\n(non-rigid) tensor-triangulated category which contains it."}

Our core idea lies in\nthe fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely\ndetermined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of\nwhich can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be\nspecific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable\nquantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the\nsame vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted\nfrom the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole\ntransition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same\nexperimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole\nresonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF\nmagnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent\nsensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the\nneed for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation,\nwe derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form\nquantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization\nand orientation angles. Finally, simulation results spanning various quantum\nparameters validate the proposed approach and identify optimal operating\nregimes.

However, the factors that govern the\ndifficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger\nadoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship\nbetween the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its\ncorresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a\nsystem, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence\nfuture behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for\nevaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in\n$O((\\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement\nover the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or\nunpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that\nparallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the\noptimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable\nsystems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence\nlength. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing\npractical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently\nparallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for\nparallelizable models."}

Key results include: (i)\n$\\mu_\\lambda$ is a metric outer measure, with all Borel sets measurable and\nBorel regular; (ii) the scaling property $\\mu_\\lambda(tE) = t^n\n\\mu_{\\lambda/t}(E)$ for $t > 0$; (iii) quantitative comparability for bounded\nLipschitz domains $\\Omega$, where dimensional constants $c_n, C_n > 0$ satisfy\n$c_n (|\\Omega| + \\lambda \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial \\Omega)) \\leq\n\\mu_\\lambda(\\Omega) \\leq C_n (|\\Omega| + \\lambda \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial\n\\Omega))$, directly relating $\\mu_\\lambda$ to perimeter. This addresses\nLebesgue measure's oversight of boundary complexity while preserving\ncompatibility with the Carath\\'eodory-Hausdorff paradigm. Potential\napplications span robust numerical integration on irregular domains,\nperimeter-regularized functionals in image and shape processing, and\nboundary-aware probabilistic modeling. Examples are provided in $\\mathbb{R}$\nand $\\mathbb{R}^2$, alongside links to Minkowski content and sets of finite\nperimeter. Open problems encompass optimal constants, coarea formulas in BV\nspaces, and extensions to rectifiable sets."}

The\nconventional least-squares (\\(L^{2}\\)) misfit suffers from pronounced\nnon-convexity that leads to \\emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits,\nsuch as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use\nrequires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a\npreprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of\ntime-dependent wave data. We propose the \\emph{HV metric}, a transport-based\ndistance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for\nthe \\(L^{2}\\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing\nthe metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Fr\\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \\(f\n\\mapsto d_{\\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\\), enabling efficient adjoint-state\nimplementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the\nhyperparameters \\((\\kappa,\\lambda,\\epsilon)\\), the HV misfit seamlessly\ninterpolates between \\(L^{2}\\), \\(H^{-1}\\), and \\(H^{-2}\\) norms, offering a\ntunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global\ntransport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP\nbenchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields\nfaster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to\nboth \\(L^{2}\\) and Wasserstein misfits.

Standard approaches\nsuch as imputation or complete-case analysis can introduce bias or result in\nsubstantial information loss, especially when the missingness mechanism is not\nrandom. To address this methodological gap, we propose the Block-Pattern\nEnhanced Test (BPET), a general framework for two-sample testing that directly\naccounts for block-wise missingness without requiring imputation or deletion of\nobservations. As a concrete instantiation, we develop the Block-wise Rank In\nSimilarity graph Edge-count (BRISE) test, which extends rank-based similarity\ngraph methods to settings with block-wise missing data. Under mild conditions,\nwe establish that the null distribution of BRISE converges to a chi-squared\ndistribution.

Traditional numerical methods, such as finite elements,\nare linear in nature and often ineffective for such problems, as the mesh is\nnot tailored to the solution. Adaptive strategies, such as $h$- and\n$p$-refinement, improve efficiency by sequentially refining the mesh based on a\nposteriori error estimates. However, these methods are geometrically rigid --\nlimited to specific refinement rules -- and require solving the problem on a\nsequence of adaptive meshes, which can be computationally expensive. Moreover,\nthe design of effective a posteriori error estimates is problem-dependent and\nnon-trivial. In this work, we study a specific nonlinear approximation scheme\nbased on overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-spline patches, where knot\npositions act as nonlinear parameters controlling the geometry of the\ndiscretisation.

In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability\nGramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction\nproblem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\\gamma$ to\nminimize the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also\nprove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and\ndemonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced\nmodels. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative\napproaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach\nalso provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally\nconvergent methods."}

As the analytical solution is available only in exceptional cases,\ndynamic optimization aims to efficiently find approximations but often neglects\nnon-Markovian time-interdependencies. Methods on scenario trees can represent\nsuch interdependencies but are subject to the curse of dimensionality. To ease\nthis problem, researchers typically approximate the uncertainty by smaller but\nmore accurate trees. In this article, we focus on multi-stage optimal tree\nquantization methods of time-interdependent stochastic processes, for which we\ndevelop novel bounds and demonstrate that the upper bound can be minimized via\nprojected gradient descent incorporating the tree structure as linear\nconstraints. Consequently, we propose an efficient quantization procedure,\nwhich improves forward-looking samples using a backward step on the tree. We\napply the results to the multi-stage inventory control with time-interdependent\ndemand.

Conventional\nmethods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle\nto adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions\nand increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep\nReinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is\ndesigned to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of\nquantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory\nin capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in\nfacilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over\n1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81\n(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A\ncomparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost\nsavings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods.

Our main result is an essentially complete resolution of the problem for\n$G=\\mathbb{F}_2^n$: we show that there is an absolute constant $C>0$ such that\nevery subset $S\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ of size at least $C$\nadmits a valid ordering. Our proof combines techniques from additive and\nprobabilistic combinatorics, including the Freiman--Ruzsa theorem and the\nabsorption method.\n  Along the way, we also solve the general problem for moderately large\nsubsets: there is a constant $c>0$ such that for every group $G$ (not\nnecessarily abelian), every subset $S \\subseteq G\\setminus \\{\\mathrm{id}\\}$ of\nsize at least $|G|^{1-c}$ admits a valid ordering. Previous work in this\ndirection concerned only sets of size at least $(1-o(1))|G|$. A main ingredient\nin our proof is a structural result, similar in spirit to the Arithmetic\nRegularity Lemma, showing that every Cayley graph can be efficiently decomposed\ninto mildly quasirandom components."}

The two phases occupy domains of the same\nspatial dimension, separated by a moving interface defined by the trace of the\nporoelastic displacement, which exhibits low regularity and strong geometric\nnonlinearities. Despite its importance in applications, no existence theory has\nbeen available for this nonlinear moving-domain setting, primarily because the\nlack of interface regularity precludes even the formulation of a weak solution\nframework.\n  To address this gap, we (1) introduce a regularization of the Biot\ndisplacement via spatial convolution at scale $\\delta > 0$, which defines\nregularized moving domains and interface, and (2) modify the weak formulation\nin a way that preserves energy consistency with the original problem. For each\nfixed $\\delta > 0$, we prove existence of a weak solution to the resulting\nregularized interface problem. The proof strategy involves inserting a thin\nplate of thickness $h > 0$ at the interface, applying a time-discretization via\na Lie operator splitting scheme, establishing uniform a priori bounds, and\nemploying Aubin-Lions compactness on moving domains. The analysis is\nparticularly involved, partly because the thin plate allows displacements in\nall spatial directions. Passing to the limit $h \\to 0$ with uniform-in-h\nestimates and compactness arguments yields a regularized interface weak\nsolution. The regularization introduced in this manuscript is essential to\nmaintain uniform geometric control of the moving interface and to accommodate\nvector-valued structural displacements."}

Our proof combines techniques from additive and\nprobabilistic combinatorics, including the Freiman--Ruzsa theorem and the\nabsorption method.\n  Along the way, we also solve the general problem for moderately large\nsubsets: there is a constant $c>0$ such that for every group $G$ (not\nnecessarily abelian), every subset $S \\subseteq G\\setminus \\{\\mathrm{id}\\}$ of\nsize at least $|G|^{1-c}$ admits a valid ordering. Previous work in this\ndirection concerned only sets of size at least $(1-o(1))|G|$. A main ingredient\nin our proof is a structural result, similar in spirit to the Arithmetic\nRegularity Lemma, showing that every Cayley graph can be efficiently decomposed\ninto mildly quasirandom components."}

Varying residual models across an\nenvironment manifest as modes of a piecewise residual (PWR) model that requires\na) identifying how modes are distributed across the environment and b) solving\na computationally intensive Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) problem for\ncontrol. We develop an iterative mapping algorithm capable of predicting\ntime-varying mode distributions. We then develop and solve two tractable\napproximations of the MINLP to combine with the predictor in closed-loop to\nsolve the overall control problem. In simulation, we first demonstrate how the\napproximations improve performance by 4-18% in comparison to the MINLP while\nachieving significantly lower computation times (upto 250x faster).

On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence,\nevery vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any\nearlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating\nsequence is known as $\\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the\nclosed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other\nversions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are\n$\\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by the solution size. On the other\nhand, we consider the family of Zero forcing problems which form the\nparameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one\nlooks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain\ncolor change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et\nal. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as\n$\\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the\ntreewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other\nthree variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems.\nOur algorithm also implies an $\\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for\n$\\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that\nare not in the dominating sequence."}

For polyhedra in \\emph{normal form}, I record\nexact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter\n$S:=\\sum_f(\\deg f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and\n$S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for\ngenus-0 polyhedral graphs.
