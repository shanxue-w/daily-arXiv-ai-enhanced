This method is inspired by non-stationary Particle methods, the time variable being replaced by one spatial variable. Particles trajectories are computed using the ``time-dependent'' equations, and then the approximation is based on a quadrature method using the particle locations as quadrature points. We prove the convergence of the scheme under suitable regularity assumptions on the data and the solution, together with a ``characteristic completeness'' assumption (the characteristic curves fullfill the whole computational domain). We also provide an error estimate. The scheme is tested numerically on a two dimensional linear equation and we present a numerical study of convergence. Finally, we use this method to carry out numerical simulations of a landscape evolution model, where an erodible topography evolves under the effects of water erosion and sedimentation. The scheme is then useful to deal with wet/dry areas."}

Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities.

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}

This inequality is sharp as the homogeneous map of degree 2 satisfies $N=\\binom{n+1}{2}$. Next we find a necessary and sufficient condition for a map to be homogeneous: A proper map of annuli is homogeneous if and only if its general hyperplane rank, the affine dimension of the image of a general hyperplane, is exactly $N-1$. This result is really a result classifying homogeneous proper maps of balls. A homogeneous proper ball map takes spheres centered at the origin to spheres centered at the origin. We show that if a proper ball map has general hyperplane rank $N-1$ and takes one sphere centered at the origin to a sphere centered at the origin, then it is homogeneous.

Equivalently, $b(G, Ø)$ is the minimal positive integer $k$ such that $G$ has a regular orbit on the Cartesian product $Ø^k$. A well-known conjecture of Cameron from the 1990s asserts that if $G$ is an almost simple primitive group and $H$ is a so-called non-standard subgroup, then $b(G, Ø) \\leqs 7$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the Mathieu group ${\\rm M}_{24}$ in its natural action of degree $24$.

To provide a comprehensive performance evaluation, a comparative analysis of two switching strategies is conducted: (1) hard switching and (2) soft switching. Novel closed-form expressions are derived for key performance metrics, including outage probability and bit error rate. These expressions are then utilized to investigate the impact of various system parameters. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 52.54% performance improvement over the traditional RF-FSO framework. Moreover, the integration of an aerial RIS in the second hop enhances system performance by 41.39%. Numerical findings suggest that strategically placing the aerial RIS at a lower altitude and maintaining an equal, shorter distance from both communication endpoints significantly improves overall system performance. To analyze the response under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, asymptotic analysis is performed, and the diversity order of the system is determined. Finally, the analytical results are validated through a Monte Carlo simulation."}

Nonlinearities are modeled using incremental quadratic constraints, including Lipschitz, L-smooth, and sector-bounded nonlinearities. Funnel invariance is ensured via a DLMI. Together with pointwise-in-time LMIs for state and input constraints, we formulate a continuous-time funnel synthesis problem. To solve it using numerical optimal control techniques, the DLMI is reformulated into a differential matrix equality (DME) and an LMI, where the DME acts as a funnel dynamics equation. We explore different formulations of these funnel dynamics. Continuous-time constraint satisfaction is addressed through two convex methods: one based on intermediate constraint-checking points, and another using a successive convexification method with subgradients to handle nondifferentiable maximum eigenvalue functions. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of a measurable and integrable subgradient for the latter. The method is demonstrated on two numerical examples: the control of a unicycle and a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor for obstacle avoidance."}

We focus first on the case of self-chromatic symmetric functions (self-CSFs) $X_G^G$, making some progress toward a conjecture from (arXiv:2011.06063) that the self-CSF, like the normal CSF, is always different for different trees.

We also show that the self-CSF detects the number of connected components of a forest, again with just one exception.

Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.\n  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice.

ZOSA employs Rademacher perturbation vectors to estimate gradients without requiring backpropagation. By incorporating sharpness-aware principles, it targets flat minima in the loss landscape, improving generalization. An adaptive learning rate, guided by loss variability, further ensures stable convergence. Experiments on few-shot learning tasks, such as text classification and natural language inference, show that ZOSA significantly outperforms existing methods.

These problems can be reformulated as McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) in a random environment, where the coefficients depend on the conditional law of the state given the common noise. Existing numerical methods, however, are largely limited to cases where interactions depend only on expectations or low-order moments, and therefore cannot address the general setting of full distributional dependence.\n  In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based algorithm for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise and general mean-field interactions. Building on fictitious play, our method iteratively solves conditional FBSDEs with fixed distributions, where the conditional law is efficiently represented using signatures, and then updates the distribution through supervised learning. Deep neural networks are employed both to solve the conditional FBSDEs and to approximate the distribution-dependent coefficients, enabling scalability to high-dimensional problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish convergence in terms of the fictitious play iterations, with error controlled by the supervised learning step. Numerical experiments, including a distribution-dependent mean-field game with common noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids.

Previously, it was known that $2\\sqrt n\\leq\\text{sat}^*(n,\\mathcal N)\\leq 2n$. We show that $\\text{sat}^*(n,\\mathcal N)\\geq\\frac{n+6}{4}$.

Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training."}

Compared with quantile regression, which has been extensively developed and applied across disciplines, ES regression remains in its early stage, partly because the traditional empirical risk minimization framework is not directly applicable. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric framework for expected shortfall regression based on a two-step approach that treats the conditional quantile function as a nuisance parameter. Leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, we construct a two-step ES estimator using feedforward ReLU networks, which can alleviate the curse of dimensionality when the underlying functions possess hierarchical composition structures. However, ES estimation is inherently sensitive to heavy-tailed response or error distributions. To address this challenge, we integrate a properly tuned Huber loss into the neural network training, yielding a robust deep ES estimator that is provably resistant to heavy-tailedness in a non-asymptotic sense and first-order insensitive to quantile estimation errors in the first stage. Comprehensive simulation studies and an empirical analysis of the effect of El Niño on extreme precipitation illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method."}

We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation. Based on this estimator, we devise an adaptive algorithm that automatically refines the mesh and pushes the truncation boundary towards infinity.

A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging."}

Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty."}

The nonlocality in the equation takes the form of a Dirichlet-Neumann operator whose analyticity (in standard function spaces) is demonstrated by studying its defining boundary-value problem in newly introduced Sobolev spaces for radial functions.\\ Using rudimentary fixed-point arguments and Fourier analysis we rigorously reduce the equation for $η$ to a perturbation of a Korteweg-de Vries equation (for strong surface tension) or a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (for weak surface tension), both of which have nondegenerate explicit solitary-wave solutions.

To complement this, Bultena and Ruskey considered $n$-Venn diagrams that minimize the number of crossings, which implies that many curves intersect in every crossing.

They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals."}

These methods effectively mitigate size distortions that commonly arise in standard inference procedures under endogeneity, near nonstationarity, heavy tails, and persistent volatility. The proposed tests are simple to implement and applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time models. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance across a range of realistic settings. An empirical application examines the predictability of excess stock returns using the dividend-price and earnings-price ratios as predictors.

At the upper layer, optimal PSES siting and network topology decisions are made to minimize total investment and operational costs. The middle-layer formulation tackles worst case uncertainty scenarios via the optimal power flow model, utilizing ambiguity sets to capture correlated uncertainties. To handle non-convexities introduced by binary variables for energy storage systems, we propose and rigorously prove the exactness of a novel relaxation approach.

In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations.

However, the uncertainty in this step is often overlooked due to a lack of satisfactory methods. Frequentists have no broadly applicable confidence set constructions for a model's structure, and Bayesian posterior credible sets do not achieve the desired finite-sample coverage. In this paper, we propose an extension of the possibility-theoretic inferential model (IM) framework that offers reliable, data-driven uncertainty quantification about the unknown model structure. This particular extension allows for the inclusion of incomplete prior information about the unknown structure that facilitates regularization. We prove that this new, regularized, possibilistic IM's uncertainty quantification is suitably calibrated relative to the set of joint distributions compatible with the data-generating process and assumed partial prior knowledge about the structure. This implies, among other things, that the derived confidence sets for the unknown model structure attain the nominal coverage probability in finite samples. We provide background and guidance on quantifying prior knowledge in this new context and analyze two benchmark data sets, comparing our results to those obtained by existing methods."}

This strengthens previous results of this form, which only showed that stable motivic homotopy theory is a six-functor formalism, and is initial, but not that the morphisms from it commute with the six operations.\n  We also prove a similar result for the stable motivic homotopy theory of complex analytic stacks, and produce a Betti realization for stacks that commutes with Grothendieck's six operations, generalizing previous results of Ayoub for quasi-projective schemes.\n  In order to do this, we give a generalized and enhanced account of Voevodsky's geometric criterion for six-functor formalisms. Our version of Voevodsky's principle makes sense in more general geometric contexts (not only algebraic geometry), and also provides a criterion for showing that a morphism between six-functor formalisms is compatible with the six operations."}

Our main result is to establish conditions on the input and the filter functions under which the filtered data are informative for system identification, i.e., they satisfy a certain rank condition. The proposed framework encompasses several filter functions that have already appeared in the literature. Building on the proposed filtering framework, we develop an experiment design procedure where the input signal is designed online during system operation.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch.

While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity."}

While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate.

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering.

However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions."}

By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov--Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson--Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \\simeq -0.335\\,\\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called \"gravothermal catastrophe\"). In this work, we assume $E>E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov--Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."}

Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.\n  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery."}

Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.\n  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums."}

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$.

We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank.

We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\\to\\infty, h\\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first fully conservative, Landau-native binary-collision model rigorously shown to produce the Landau equation over the entire interaction range."}

Our Cost Function Landscape Analysis revealed that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm angle parameters $γ$ were largely inactive in the noiseless regime. This insight motivated a parameter-filtered optimization approach, in which we focused the search space exclusively on the active $β$ parameters. This filtering substantially improved parameter efficiency for fast optimizers like Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation (reducing evaluations from 21 to 12 in the noiseless case) and enhanced robustness, demonstrating that leveraging structural insights is an effective architecture-aware noise mitigation strategy for Variational Quantum Algorithms."}

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches."}

This requires certain relaxations of the Hibler energies and, by the different function space set-up, comes with novel challenges.

Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning."}

Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes.

The regret is defined as the sum of individual player regrets measured by the utility gap with respect to the optimal item bundle given the prices. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $Δ$-regret equilibria, where we establish a connection to the duality gap and the integrality gap of the social welfare problem.

In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning.

We call such a POVM \\emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.\n  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \\(n\\): the size is at most \\(\\binom{n+1}{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and at most \\(n^{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \\(w \\mid n(n-1)\\), an \\((n,w,w-1)\\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \\(n + n(n-1)/w\\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \\(w=2,n-1\\), and \\(n\\)."}

Two key features of this work are that the bounds are non-asymptotic, holding true for finite time horizons, and, crucially, that the latter hold uniformly over an entire class of admissible increment sequences. This provides a robust framework for applications. These results are, in particular, tailored for the analysis of processes derived through a time-dependent tilting of the increments of a time-homogeneous random walk."}

Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines."}

As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold."}

This bound is expressed in terms of the principal curvatures of the boundary and is sharp, with equality attained for a ball. Moreover, it implies the existence of a sequence of convex domains with fixed volume and the first exterior Steklov eigenvalues tending to infinity. This contrasts with the interior case, as well as with the two-dimensional exterior case, for which we show that an analogue of the Weinstock isoperimetric inequality holds."}

This method applies not only to Vidinli algebras but also recovers classical structures including spin factor Jordan algebras and Heisenberg Lie algebras.
