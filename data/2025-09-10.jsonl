While originally developed for linear Gaussian settings, it has been\nextended to nonlinear problems through approaches such as the extended and\nunscented Kalman filters. Despite its broad use, a persistent limitation is\nthat the underlying approximate model is fixed, which can lead to significant\ndeviations from the true system dynamics. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the differentiable Kalman filter (DKF), an adjoint-based two-level\noptimization framework designed to reduce the mismatch between approximate and\ntrue dynamics. Within this framework, a field inversion step first uncovers the\ndiscrepancy, after which a closure model is trained to capture the discovered\ndynamics, allowing the filter to adapt flexibly and scale efficiently. We\nillustrate the capabilities of the DKF using two representative examples: a\nrocket dynamics model and the Allen-Cahn boundary value problem. In both cases,\nand across a range of noise levels, the DKF consistently reduces state\nreconstruction error by at least 90% compared to the classical Kalman filter,\nwhile also maintaining robust uncertainty quantification. These results\ndemonstrate that the DKF not only improves estimation accuracy by large margins\nbut also enhances interpretability and scalability, offering a principled\npathway for combining data assimilation with modern machine learning."}

Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear\ncode $C \\leq \\mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\\perp :=\\{x \\in\n\\mathcal{F}_2^n:\\forall c \\in C, \\langle x,c\\rangle=0\\}$ are asymptotically\ngood (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are\nencodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications\nmore broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure\ncomputation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda\net al (CCS 2025, to appear).\n  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast\ngood dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA)\ncodes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2\ncode, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps --\nwhere first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the\nprefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative\nsteps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and\nafterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these\ntwo operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code\nis very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.\n  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and\nFagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the\ninput-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a\ngiven weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new\nchallenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix\n(which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by\ncareful case analysis."}

Scheiderer\nproved that, for smooth curves over the real numbers with nonempty real locus,\neach divisor of sufficiently high degree is linearly equivalent to an effective\ntotally real one. The smallest degree N(X) with this property is called the\ntotally real divisor threshold.\n  When the field is non-Archimedean, we obtain a classification of topological\ntypes of smooth curves for which N(X) can be infinite. As a consequence, for\ncurves over the real numbers we prove that N(X) cannot be bounded from above\nonly in terms of the topological type, unless the real locus has many connected\ncomponents. We complement this qualitative result with a quantitative lower\nbound for N(X), depending on metric properties of the Jacobian and the curve in\nthe Bergman metric.

Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often\noperate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the\nconventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates\nchannel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.\nWe first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the\nplane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid\nspherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,\nwithin a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario.

The\nSD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and\nrange. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,\nenabling the use of tensor-OMP.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk\ntree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient\napproximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we\napproximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal\nprobability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.\n  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we\nindeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in\nturn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first\nSSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We\nprove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold\nquite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models.\nCombined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new\nSSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM\ncan be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for\nWeitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property\nindependent of zero-freeness."}
