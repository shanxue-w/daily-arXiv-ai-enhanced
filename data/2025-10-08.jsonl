This theory is\ncharacterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive relationship between\nstress and strain, which intrinsically enforces a limit on the norm of the\nstrain tensor. This approach allows the development of very large stresses, as\nexpected near a crack tip, while ensuring that the corresponding strains remain\nphysically bounded. A loosely coupled system of linear and nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations governing the response of a thermo-mechanical\ntransversely isotropic solid is formulated. We develop a robust numerical\nsolution based on the finite element method, utilizing a conforming finite\nelement discretization within a continuous Galerkin framework to solve the\ntwo-dimensional boundary value problem. The model is applied to analyze the\nstress and strain fields near an edge crack under severe thermo-mechanical\nloading. Our numerical results reveal a significant departure from classical\npredictions: while stress concentrates intensely at the crack tip, the strain\ngrows at a substantially slower rate and remains bounded throughout the domain.\nThis work validates the efficacy of the strain-limiting model in regularizing\nthermo-elastic crack-tip fields and establishes a reliable computational\nfoundation for the predictive modeling of thermally driven crack initiation and\nevolution in advanced anisotropic materials."}

The main theorem demonstrates that if random linear\ncodes satisfy the complement of an LCL property $\\mathcal{P}$ with high\nprobability, then one can construct explicit codes satisfying the complement of\n$\\mathcal{P}$ as well, with an enlarged yet constant alphabet size. This gives\nthe first explicit constructions for list recovery, as well as special cases\n(e.g., list recovery with erasures, zero-error list recovery, perfect hash\nmatrices), with parameters matching those of random linear codes.

In quantum mechanics, the spectral gap of Schr\\\"odinger\noperators has a long history of study due to its physical relevance, while in\nquantum computing spectral gaps are an important proxy for efficiency, such as\nin the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Motivated by convex optimization, we study\nSchr\\\"odinger operators associated with self-concordant barriers over convex\ndomains and prove non-asymptotic lower bounds on the spectral gap for this\nclass of operators. Significantly, we find that the spectral gap does not\ndisplay any condition-number dependence when the usual Laplacian is replaced by\nthe Laplace--Beltrami operator, which uses second-order information of the\nbarrier and hence can take the curvature of the barrier into account. As an\nalgorithmic application, we construct a novel quantum interior point method\nthat applies to arbitrary self-concordant barriers and shows no\ncondition-number dependence. To achieve this we combine techniques from\nsemiclassical analysis, convex optimization, and quantum annealing."}

Sayed"], "title": "Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.MA", "math.OC"], "comment": "39 pages", "summary": "Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,\ndue to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds\nand strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the\nnumber of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong\nperformance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved\nresults stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest\n(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap\nbetween users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on\nthe variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more\nfine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of\nindependent interest."}
