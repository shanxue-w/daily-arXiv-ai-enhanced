While these algorithms are\nwell-suited for a wide range of equations, they often exhibit suboptimal\nperformance when applied to equations with large local gradients, resulting in\nsubstantial localized errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes an\nadaptive PINN algorithm designed to improve accuracy in such cases. The core\nidea of the algorithm is to adaptively adjust the distribution of collocation\npoints based on the recovery-type a-posterior error of the current numerical\nsolution, enabling a better approximation of the true solution. This approach\nis inspired by the adaptive finite element method. By combining the\nrecovery-type a-posteriori estimator, a gradient-recovery estimator commonly\nused in the adaptive finite element method (FEM) with PINNs, we introduce the\nRecovery-type a-posteriori estimator enhanced adaptive PINN (R-PINN) and\ncompare its performance with a typical adaptive PINN algorithm, FI-PINN. Our\nresults demonstrate that R-PINN achieves faster convergence with fewer adaptive\npoints and significantly outperforms in the cases with multiple regions of\nlarge errors than FI-PINN.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

The\ntransmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by\nseparate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC).

This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

The equator map\nfrom the unit ball to the Euclidean sphere provides an explicit critical point\nof all aforementioned energy functionals. During the last four decades many\nresearchers studied the stability of this particular map when considered as a\ncritical point of one of these energy functionals, see e.g. \\cite{MR4436204},\n\\cite{MR705882}.\n  Recently, Nakauchi \\cite{MR4593065} introduced a generalized radial\nprojection map and proved that this map is both a critical point of the energy\nand a critical point of the $p$-energy. This generalized radial projection map\ngives rise to a generalized equator map which is also both a critical point of\nthe energy and a critical point of the $p$-energy.\n  In this manuscript we first of all show that the generalized equator map is\nalso a critical point of the extrinsic $k$-energy. Then, the main focus is a\ndetailed stability analysis of this map, considered as a critical point of both\nthe extrinsic $k$-energy and the $p$-energy. We thus establish a number of\ninteresting generalizations of the classical (in)stability results of J\\\"ager\nand Kaul \\cite{MR705882}."}

In this note, we suggest a possible path toward formalizing\nneuromorphic control systems. We apply the proposed framework to a rhythmic\ncontrol case study and rigorously show how it has the potential to make\nneuromorphic control systems analysis and design amenable to mature control\ntheoretical approaches like describing function analysis and harmonic balance,\nfast-slow analysis, discrete and hybrid systems, and robust optimization."}

Version revised after ICML 2025 reviews", "summary": "Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach\nfor neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex\nrelaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.\nHowever, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied\nto deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict\nfeasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality\nof SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate\nthat as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be\nlost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To\naddress the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions\nto enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods\ncan successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing\nmethods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the\nvalid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are\ntraditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually\nnot only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This\nwork provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based\nDNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to\ndeeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and\nsecure systems with DNNs."}

In view of the\nrequired computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to\nthis end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation\nwas recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of\ntwists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the\nspatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is\naccompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An\nadvantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in\nterms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is\ndemonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot."}
