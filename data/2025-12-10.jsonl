It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results."}

Furthermore, incorporating inertial effects alongside viscous resistance enlarges the parameter space, making calibration more difficult.\n  In this work, we propose a new type of boundary condition based on the method of asymptotic partial decomposition of a domain (MAPDD), which we denote as the Duct Boundary Condition (DuBC). This approach enables the incorporation of geometrically reduced domains as a boundary term with only local coupling in the implicit case. Moreover, the DuBC accounts for both viscous and inertial effects simultaneously using a single physical parameter. Additionally, we derive a fractional-step time-marching scheme including the DuBC. We demonstrate the features of the DuBC in coronary artery blood flow simulations, including sequential parameter estimation from noisy velocity data."}

This added generality is useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once. In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural application to modeling concurrency. In this article, we study categories of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic, we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally, we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory. The realization namely allows one to compare syntactic constructions on relational presheaves and geometric ones. Thanks to it, we are able to provide a syntactic counterpart of the blowup operation, which was recently introduced by Haucourt on directed geometric semantics, as way of turning a directed space into a manifold."}

Thus, the module is determined by an explicit Milnor idempotent. We apply this new tool to the K-theory of quantum complex projective planes to determine their $K_0$-generators in terms of modules associated to noncommutative Hopf fibrations.

Firstly, by designing appropriate optimizing variables, the considered MF-SLQR problem is transformed into a new static nonconvex constrained optimization problem with equivalence preserved in certain senses. After that, the equivalent formulation of the duality results is constructed via finding the solution of the generalized Lyapunov equation. Then, the strong duality is analyzed, based on which we establish a primal-dual algorithm by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

Such a decomposition is obtained together with the Artin--Wedderburn Theorem. The main goal of the dissertation is to explicitly decompose given group algebras as a direct sum of their projective indecomposable modules.\n  To achieve this, we determine the radical series of each projective indecomposable module of the given group algebras. For a group algebra over characteristic $p$, each projective indecomposable module has a simple head that is isomorphic to its socle. Projective covers and injective envelopes are used to construct these modules. A cyclic group algebra is uniserial, and a $p$-group algebra over characteristic $p$ is itself a projective indecomposable module. Using these properties, we explicitly find all projective indecomposable modules for the following group algebras over characteristic $2$: the Klein four-group, the alternating group $A_4$, and the alternating group $A_5$. Their relationships play an important role in this process.\n  Since $p$-group algebras have trivial head and trivial socle, the Klein four-group algebra has a corresponding radical series. Its decomposition into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules is described explicitly, and the Cartan matrix of a group algebra is obtained by calculating the multiplicities of simples in its projective indecomposable modules.\n  The topic is then extended slightly by considering the unique decomposition of a group algebra into a direct sum of particular modules known as blocks. For $kA_4$, the primitive orthogonal idempotents are calculated, and since $kA_4$ has one block, it is equal to its block decomposition. For $kA_5$, we show that there are two blocks, determined by checking the nonzero entries in its Cartan matrix."}

We further consider several factorization properties associated with this notion. Then, we investigate the basic properties of such domains, provide examples, and explore the behavior of the completely atomic property under standard constructions such as localization, polynomial rings, and $D+M$ constructions.

Examples with $k>1$ include degree-Rips bifiltrations and models of the multicover bifiltration. We consider the problem of converting a $k$-critical bifiltration into a $1$-critical (i.e. free) chain complex with equivalent homology. This is known as computing a free resolution of the underlying chain complex and is a first step toward post-processing such bifiltrations.\n  We present two algorithms. The first one computes free resolutions corresponding to path graphs and assembles them to a chain complex by computing additional maps. The simple combinatorial structure of path graphs leads to good performance in practice, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. However, its worst-case bound is quadratic in the input size because long paths might yield dense boundary matrices in the output. Our second algorithm replaces the simplex-wise path graphs with ones that maintain short paths which leads to almost linear runtime and output size.\n  We demonstrate that pre-computing a free resolution speeds up the task of computing a minimal presentation of the homology of a $k$-critical bifiltration in a fixed dimension. Furthermore, our findings show that a chain complex that is minimal in terms of generators can be asymptotically larger than the non-minimal output complex of our second algorithm in terms of description size."}

Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}

In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly.\n  We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings."}

This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \\textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces.

Our valuations are based on the indifference pricing principle, which builds on optimal trading strategies and calibrates to the user's financial position, market views and risk preferences. The underlying optimization problem is solved with the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm which is applicable to various specifications of storages, and it allows for e.g. hard constraints on storage capacity and charging speed. We illustrate the approach in intraday trading where the agent charges or discharges a battery over a finite number of delivery periods, and the electricity prices are subject to bid-ask spreads and significant uncertainty. Optimal strategies are found in a matter of minutes on a regular PC. We find that the corresponding trading strategies and battery valuations vary consistently with respect to the agent's risk preferences as well as the physical characteristics of the battery."}

Our approach relies on the natural Lagrangian change of coordinates and a detailed analysis of the linearized problem (the Stokes system) in the maximal regularity regime, formulated in the Lebesgue spaces $L_p(0,T; L_q)$, including time-weighted variants. The main difficulty lies in the treatment of boundary terms, for which we apply a new technique based on complex interpolation to control nonlinear terms in fractional Sobolev spaces. This strategy also allows us to handle the case of variable density, which is not easily addressed by approaches based on Besov spaces.\n  Using this framework and real interpolation techniques, we construct also solutions in the Lorentz class $L_{p,1}(0,T; L_q)$ in time. The method further enables a rigorous study of the stability of equilibrium configurations. In particular, we resolve the problem in two spatial dimensions, where the interplay between geometry and regularity is especially subtle.

A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples."}

This study propose a novel fourth-order multi-scale (FOMS) computational method for high-accuracy and efficient simulation of composite Kirchhoff plates with highly periodic heterogeneities. At first, two-scale asymptotic expansion theory is employed to establish the high-accuracy fourth-order multi-scale computation model with novel fourth-order correctors for composite Kirchhoff plates, which are governed by fourth-order partial differential equation (PDE) with periodically oscillatory and highly discontinuous coefficients. Then, the locally point-wise error analysis is derived to theoretically illustrate the local balance preserving of fourth-order multi-scale model enabling high-accuracy multi-scale computation. Furthermore, a global error estimation with an explicit order for fourth-order multi-scale solutions is first demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. In contrast to the second- and third-order multi-scale solutions, only the fourth-order one is capable of providing an explicit error order estimate. Additionally, an efficient numerical algorithm is developed to conduct high-accuracy simulation for heterogeneous plate structures. Extensive numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results for the computational convergence and accuracy of the proposed method.

The deviation of the slow motion, scaled by epsilon^{1/2-H}, from its effective, time-dependent random limit converges, as the time-separation scale epsilon tends to zero, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and influenced by an additional space--time Gaussian field. Since the averaging principle and the fractional homogenization hold in different modes of convergence, obtaining the required joint convergence is a delicate matter. Moreover, neither the continuity of the Ito--Lyons solution map nor the martingale method is directly applicable for our purposes, so the proof requires several innovations.

These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size."}

Under ergodic assumptions ensuring the applicability of the fractional averaging and fractional homogenization theorems of Hairer and Li (arXiv:1902.11251, arXiv:2109.06948), we establish a fluctuation result. The deviation of the slow motion, scaled by epsilon^{1/2-H}, from its effective, time-dependent random limit converges, as the time-separation scale epsilon tends to zero, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and influenced by an additional space--time Gaussian field. Since the averaging principle and the fractional homogenization hold in different modes of convergence, obtaining the required joint convergence is a delicate matter. Moreover, neither the continuity of the Ito--Lyons solution map nor the martingale method is directly applicable for our purposes, so the proof requires several innovations. To establish the fluctuation theorem, we combine cumulant methods with a residue lemma and formulate the enlarged system as a rough differential equation in a suitable space."}

To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure. Our analysis further clarifies how the prior score-matching error and the condition number of the Bayesian inverse problem influence overall performance.

We extend cRKFR methods to handle hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. To handle stiff source terms, we use IMplicit EXplicit (IMEX) time integration schemes such that the implicitness is local to each solution point, and thus does not increase inter-element communication. Although non-conservative products do not correspond to a physical flux, we formulate the scheme using numerical fluxes at element interfaces. We use similar numerical fluxes for a lower order finite volume scheme on subcells of each element, which is then blended with the high order cRKFR scheme to obtain a robust scheme for problems with non-smooth solutions. Combined with a flux limiter at the element interfaces, the subcell based blending scheme preserves the physical admissibility of the solution, e.g., positivity of density and pressure for compressible Euler equations. The procedure thus leads to an admissibility preserving IMEX cRKFR scheme for hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. The capability of the scheme to handle stiff terms is shown through numerical tests involving Burgers' equations, reactive Euler's equations, and the ten moment problem. The non-conservative treatment is tested using variable advection equations, shear shallow water equations, the GLM-MHD, and the multi-ion MHD equations."}

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space.

In the first phase, PaKS employs a pattern recognition technique to identify an implicit spatial separation of potential locations and customers into subsets, called regions, within which location and assignment decisions are strongly interdependent. In the second phase, PaKS employs an enhanced Kernel Search (KS) heuristic that leverages the interdependencies among the decision variables identified in the first phase. On a set of 112 benchmark instances, consisting of up to 1,000 locations and 1,000 customers, computational results show that PaKS consistently outperforms both a standard KS implementation and the current state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the SSCFLP, as well as CPLEX when run with a time limit. For these instances, PaKS achieved an average gap compared to the best known solution of 0.02%. Experimental results conducted on a large set of new very large test problems, comprising up to 2,000 locations and 2,000 customers, demonstrate that PaKS outperforms both the standard KS heuristic and CPLEX in terms of quality of the solution found, finding the largest number of best solutions, and achieving the smallest average gap."}

To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \\emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights.\n  Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds.

Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements.

Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial.

This work represents the first study of density estimation on this space under any metric. For independent observations, an asymptotic upper bound on the mean absolute error is also derived.

This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \\textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \\times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold.

Flow variables are encoded on a staggered space-time mesh, leveraging the principles of mimetic spectral element discretization. Unlike standard Lagrangian methods, which are prone to mesh distortion, this framework computes fluid deformations in a fixed reference configuration and systematically maps them to the physical domain via the Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Further, the structure preserving design ensures that the discrete analogues of the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are satisfied up to machine precision. The formulation also inherently handles low-Mach number flows without specialized preconditioning. Numerical experiments on expansion and compression flows confirm the accuracy, stability, and exact conservation properties of the discretization."}

Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \\textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \\times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure."}

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning.

We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations.

The results show that the MFG model with appropriate parameters and convexification yields sentiment density predictions that align closely with observed data and satisfy the governing equations. While current parameter selection relies on manual calibration, our findings establish the first proof-of-concept evidence that MFG models can capture complex temporal patterns in public sentiment, laying the groundwork for future work on systematic parameter identification methods, i.e. solutions of coefficient inverse problems for the MFG system."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to deal with these disadvantages. Our method can be implemented with various Hessian approximations, including methods that use only the first-order information. Thus, computational costs might be drastically reduced. Also, it can be adjusted to problems' geometries via the usage of different Bregman divergences.

To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space.

Given binary treatments, the experimenter's goal is to choose the treatment with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment, in order to maximize welfare. We consider adaptive experiments that consist of two phases, the treatment allocation phase and the treatment choice phase. The experiment starts with the treatment allocation phase, where the experimenter allocates treatments to experimental subjects to gather observations. During this phase, the experimenter can adaptively update the allocation probabilities using the observations obtained in the experiment. After the allocation phase, the experimenter proceeds to the treatment choice phase, where one of the treatments is selected as the best.

The DC optimization produces candidate vectors that are then used within the GW randomized rounding scheme to generate high-quality binary solutions.

Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\\mathbb{R}^3/Λ$ where $Λ$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm.

In stark contrast to deterministic, full-information models of learning (or models with a vanishing learning rate), we show that the resulting dynamics do not converge in general. In lieu of this, we ask instead which actions are played more often in the long run, and by how much. We show that, in strongly monotone games, the dynamics of regularized learning may wander away from equilibrium infinitely often, but they always return to its vicinity in finite time (which we estimate), and their long-run distribution is sharply concentrated around a neighborhood thereof. We quantify the degree of this concentration, and we show that these favorable properties may all break down if the underlying game is not strongly monotone -- underscoring in this way the limits of regularized learning in the presence of persistent randomness and uncertainty."}

Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake-phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation."}

The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes."}

We develop a generative modeling framework for worst-case generation for a pre-specified risk, based on min-max optimization over continuous probability distributions, namely the Wasserstein space. Unlike traditional discrete distributionally robust optimization approaches, which often suffer from scalability issues, limited generalization, and costly worst-case inference, our framework exploits the Brenier theorem to characterize the least favorable (worst-case) distribution as the pushforward of a transport map from a continuous reference measure, enabling a continuous and expressive notion of risk-induced generation beyond classical discrete DRO formulations. Based on the min-max formulation, we propose a Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)-type scheme that updates the decision model and the transport map in a single loop, establishing global convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions and possibly without convexity-concavity. We also propose to parameterize the transport map using a neural network that can be trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations by matching the transported training samples, thereby achieving a simulation-free approach. The efficiency of the proposed method as a risk-induced worst-case generator is validated by numerical experiments on synthetic and image data."}

Subsequently, we assume that the interactions among the study units are governed either by (i) a dense graph or (ii) an i.i.d. Gaussian matrix. In each case, we show that the treatment effects have well-defined limits as the population size diverges to infinity. Additionally, we develop polynomial time algorithms to consistently evaluate the treatment effects in each case.

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."}

Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|<=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.\n  In the sub-extremal |a|<M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.\n  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon.

Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection.

The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling.

We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems."}

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems."}

When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context."}

We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces.

Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase."}

We provide precise asymptotics for this phenomenon, which is an echo of non-quasilocality happening in higher dimensions. Second, we turn to the one-sided point of view and prove that the TBF is a g-measure in the sense of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The corresponding g-function is quasilocal but becomes long-range again for large $p$. From that we finally develop our third view, in which we provide a transparent construction of the process in terms of a driving Markov chain on the integers of generalized house of cards type, offering a novel perspective on the TBF."}

The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|<=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.\n  In the sub-extremal |a|<M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.\n  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions."}
