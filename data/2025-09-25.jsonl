We define an index that\ndetects exchangeability for common models, is invariant by reparametrization,\ncan be estimated through samples, and, crucially, is well-suited for\nposteriors. We achieve these properties through the use of Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Spaces, which map any random probability to a random object on a\nHilbert space. This leads to many convenient properties and tractable\nexpressions, especially a priori and under mixing.

The model integrates production and\nremanufacturing rates as functions of lot sizes and cycle numbers to develop a\nfeasible inventory cost function. A key contribution of the study is\nformulating a multiobjective optimization framework that simultaneously\nminimizes inventory costs and accounts for environmental sustainability by\nconsidering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption during\nproduction processes. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) model, with integer constraints on lot sizes and cycle\ncounts and a continuous return rate. Numerical case studies taking test\nproblems from existing literature are used to validate the model through\nextensive sensitivity analyses. Both mathematical optimization and heuristic\noptimization methods are applied to solve multiobjective optimization problems,\nand Pareto fronts are illustrated along with the interpretation of the results.\nThe results, obtained using solvers in MATLAB and AMPL, highlight the models\nability to balance operational efficiency and environmental responsibility.\nPareto frontiers generated from the analysis provide strategic insights for\ndecision-makers seeking to optimize cost and sustainability in inventory\nsystems."}

Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC\noffloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe\nchallenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port\nconfiguration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem.\nFirstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed\nSensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating\ninformation relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA\nchannels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional\noptimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port\nselection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a\ngame theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA)\nbased offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples\nand coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base\nstation side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality\nof power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents\nto achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the\nproposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading\nperformance, outperforming benchmarks.

In particular, maintaining high\nteleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence,\nwhich disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation\ntechniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic\nenvironments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be\nharnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation?

Our study focuses on two measurement-based\nstrategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal\n(QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM)\nwith post selection and QMR.

Estimation of model parameters such as\ncoupling strengths or measurement efficiencies is essential, yet in practice\nthese parameters are often uncertain. We first establish the existence and\nwell-posedness of a reduced quantum filter: for an N-level system, the\nconditional evolution can be represented in an O(N)-dimensional real state\nspace rather than the full O(N^2) density-matrix state space. Building on this,\nwe extend the stability theory of quantum filters, showing that exponential\nconvergence persists not only under mismatched initial states but also in the\npresence of parameter mismatch. Finally, we develop an estimation framework for\ncontinuous parameter domains and prove almost sure consistency of the estimator\nin the long-time limit. These results yield a rigorous treatment of parameter\nestimation for jump-diffusion SMEs, combining structural reduction with\nstability and identifiability analysis, and thereby extend the mathematical\ntheory of parameter estimation for open quantum systems."}

In this work we\ngive a quantum algorithm based on Grover's search algorithm, computing the\ndegree of contextuality in $O(\\sqrt{n} \\log\\log{n})$ in $n$ states, a speedup\nover classical brute force method. We also study variations of Grover which\nencode the relevant information in the phases of the basis states, reducing\ncircuit width and depth requirements with indicative complexity of\n$O(n^{\\frac{1}{3}}(\\log{n})^{2}\\log\\log{n})$.

To circumvent this impasse, it was proposed to\nregularize such problems via an entropic penalty, leading to computationally\ntractable proxies. Indeed, this enabled efficient algorithms, notably in the\ncontext of Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problems, but it is unknown how well\nsolutions of the regularized problem approximate those of the original one for\nsmall regularization parameters. Treating the broader framework of general\nquadratic programs (QPs), we establish that the approximation gap decays\nexponentially quickly for concave QPs, while the rate for general indefinite or\nconvex QPs can be as slow as linear. Our analysis builds on the study of the\nentropic penalty in linear programming by leveraging a new representation for\nconcave QPs, which connects them to a family of linear programs with varying\ncosts. Building on these results, we design an algorithm which, given a local\nsolution of the entropic QP, returns a candidate minimizer of the original QP\nand certifies it. We apply these findings to a general class of discrete GW\nproblems, yielding new variational forms and the first exponentially vanishing\nentropic approximation bound in the GW literature."}

Our approach\ngeneralizes and extends existing guidance strategies that are limited to target\nencirclement and provides a degree of optimality.
