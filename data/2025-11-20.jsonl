In this work, we provide a characterization of the complete, exhaustive family of distinct algorithms using predetermined step-sizes, represented as lower triangular H-matrices, which attain the same optimal convergence rate. The characterization is based on polynomials in the entries of the H-matrix that we call H-invariants, whose values stay constant over all optimal H-matrices, together with H-certificates, of which nonnegativity precisely specifies the region of optimality within the common level set of H-invariants. The H-invariance theory we present offers a novel view of optimal acceleration in first-order optimization as a mathematical study of carefully selected invariants, certificates, and structures induced by them."}

The problem, posed over a finite time horizon, is reformulated deterministically by expressing the cost functional in terms of a collection of second-moment matrices of the system state. A projection operator is introduced to restrict the analysis to the subspace of visited states, namely those with positive probability of being reached within the time horizon. The solution of the resulting deterministic problem is obtained from a reduced-order system of coupled matrix Riccati differential equations involving only the visited states, which define a quadratic value function satisfying a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equation. The structure of this equation is formally justified in the matrix setting via the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, establishing a rigorous foundation for the deterministic reformulation and resolving an open aspect in previous literature. Several numerical examples, including cases with non-communicating states, validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed generalization."}

An advantage of DH systems is that they are always stable due to the structure of their coefficient matrices, and, under further weak conditions, even asymptotically stable. In this paper, we discuss the computation of the stability radii for a given asymptotically stable DH system; i.e., the smallest structured perturbation that puts a DH system on the boundary of the region of asymptotic stability, so that it has purely imaginary eigenvalues. We obtain explicit computable formulas for various structured stability radii. For this, the problem of computing stability radii is reformulated in terms of minimizing the Rayleigh quotient of a Hermitian matrix or the sum of two generalized Rayleigh quotients of Hermitian semidefinite matrices. This reformulation results in the problem of minimizing the largest eigenvalue of an eigenvector-dependent Hermitian matrix or minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix which depends on the eigenvector. It is also demonstrated (via numerical experiments) that, under structure-preserving perturbations, the asymptotic stability of a DH system is much more robust than under general perturbations, since the distance to instability is typically much larger when structure-preserving perturbations are considered. Finally, similar results are obtained for optimally robust representations of stable systems."}

Our approach ensures that all system trajectories remain within a specified admissible set and converge to equilibrium in a predefined time despite adversarial disturbances. The control problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum differential game, where the controller is a minimizing player and the adversary a maximizing player. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a saddle-point solution and safe predefined-time stability using a barrier Lyapunov function that satisfies a differential inequality and the steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. To address the analytical intractability of solving the HJI equation, we introduce a physics-informed learning algorithm that robustly learns the Nash safely predefined-time stabilizing control strategy.

An upshot is that when losses are averaged for a large number of units, differences in ratios and, hence, ranks, are negligible, when the average (or summed) difference between the target values and their realizations is around zero.

Mathematically, this corresponds to recovering the coefficients of a damped wave operator, or equivalently, a quadratic operator pencil in the frequency domain.\n  The Lippmann-Schwinger equation maps the unknown reflectivity and loss distribution to the measured scattered data. This mapping is nonlinear, as it requires knowledge of the internal wavefield, which itself depends on the reflectivity and loss distribution. The Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos method addresses this nonlinearity by approximating the internal solutions through the lifting of states from a reduced-order model constructed directly from the measured data.\n  In this work, we extend the method to dissipative problems, enabling the approximation of internal partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in media with both reflectivity and loss distributions. We present two complementary constructions of such internal solutions: one based on spectral data and another on frequency-domain measurements over a finite interval. This development establishes a direct link between data-driven reduced-order models for inverse problems and port-Hamiltonian dynamical systems, with reduced models obtained either from the associated spectral measure or via rational approximation. Compared to the Born approximation, which replaces the internal field with the background field, our approach yields more accurate internal reconstructions and enables faster and more robust recovery of the contrast as evidenced by our numerical experiments."}

Although well understood in low-dimensional settings, its behavior in high-dimensional regimes -- where the number of covariates $p$ may exceed the number of observations $n$ -- remains underexplored. Furthermore, existing theory is largely asymptotic, providing limited guidance for finite-sample inference. We develop a design-based, non-asymptotic analysis of the regression-adjusted ATE estimator under complete randomization. Specifically, we derive finite-sample-valid confidence intervals with explicit, instance-adaptive widths that remain informative even when $p > n$. These intervals rely on oracle (population-level) quantities, and we also outline data-driven envelopes that are computable from observed data. Our approach hinges on a refined swap sensitivity analysis: stochastic fluctuation is controlled via a variance-adaptive Doob martingale and Freedman's inequality, while design bias is bounded using Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. The analysis suggests how covariate geometry governs concentration and bias through leverages and cross-leverages, shedding light on when and how regression adjustment improves on the difference-in-means baseline."}

Without prior knowledge of the system model parameters, an adaptive and direct learning rule for the cost parameter is proposed using online off-policy system data, which only needs to satisfy the mild persistently exciting condition in the general data-driven paradigm. The adaptive and online IRL algorithm is achieved by designing full Nesterov-Todd (NT)-step primal-dual interior-point iterations. Despite solving a nonlinear and time-varying semi-definite program (SDP), the influence of system noise is rigorously analyzed, and the proposed online algorithm is shown to achieve a sublinear convergence. The proposed method is further generalized to nonlinear IRL based on differential dynamic programming. The gradient of the loss function is directly obtained via a backward pass, which eliminates the need to repeatedly solve forward RL problems as in conventional bi-level IRL frameworks.

When $0<\\varepsilon\\ll 1$, the rapidly oscillatory solution constrains the step size selection and numerical accuracy, resulting in significant computational challenges. Motivated by linearization through introducing auxiliary polynomial variables, a new class of explicit exponential integrators (EIs) has recently been developed. The methods do not require the linear part to be diagonal or with all eigenvalues to be integer multiples of a fixed value - a general assumption in multiscale methods - and attain arbitrarily high convergence order without any order conditions. The main contribution of this work is to establish a rigorous error analysis for the new class of methods. To do this, we first demonstrate the equivalence between the high-dimensional system and the original problem by employing algebraic techniques. Building upon these fundamental results, we prove that the numerical schemes have a uniform convergence order of $O(h^{k+1})$ for the solution when using at most $k$-degree auxiliary polynomial variables with time step sizes smaller than $\\varepsilon$. For larger step sizes under the bounded oscillatory energy condition, the methods achieve a convergence order of $O(\\varepsilon h^k)$ for the solution. These theoretical results are further applied to second-order oscillatory equations, yielding improved uniform accuracy with respect to $\\varepsilon$.

We establish the characterization of the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in MFG with two populations as well as the Nash equilibrium in the $N_1+N_2$-player game.

To ensure message reliability and integrity, a dual-layer redundancy framework is typically employed: error correction codes mitigate noise-induced impairments at the physical layer, while cyclic redundancy checks verify message integrity after decoding. Retransmission is initiated if verification fails. This operational model can be categorized into two types of repeated communication models: Type-I systems repeatedly transmit identical codewords, whereas Type-II systems transmit distinct coded representations of the same message. The core challenge lies in maximizing the probability of correct message decoding within a limited number of transmission rounds through verification-based feedback mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we consider a scenario where the same error-correcting code is used for repeated transmissions, and we specifically propose two classes of generalized repetition codes (GRCs), corresponding to the two repeated communication models. In contrast to classical theory, we regard GRCs as error-correcting codes under multiple metrics--that is, GRCs possess multiple minimum distances. This design enables GRCs to perform multi-round error correction under different metrics, achieving stronger error-correction capabilities than classical error-correcting codes. However, the special structure of GRCs makes their construction more challenging, as it requires simultaneously optimizing multiple minimum distances. To address this, we separately investigate the bounds and constructions for Type-I and Type-II GRCs, and obtain numerous optimal Type-I and Type-II GRCs."}

Starting from the canonical contact forms and total derivative on the finite jet bundle $J^m(\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R})$, we construct the Cartan distribution and the associated Ehresmann connection, whose non-integrability and torsion encode the geometric source of curvature corrections in statistical estimation. In the statistical jet bundle $E=\\mathbb{R}\\times L^2(μ)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_θ$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy. The resulting framework links variance bounds, curvature, and estimator efficiency through the geometry of Cartan distributions, offering a new differential equation and connection-theoretic interpretation of higher-order information inequalities."}

To address the first challenge, we propose the Greedy Mini-Extragradient (Mini-EG) method, which updates only the coordinate associated with the dominant component of the mapping at each extragradient step. This design capitalizes on componentwise Lipschitz constants that are far easier to estimate than the classical global Lipschitz constant. To further lower computational cost, we introduce a Random Mini-EG variant that replaces full mapping evaluations by sampling only a single coordinate per extragradient step. Although this resolves the second challenge from a theoretical standpoint, its practical efficiency remains limited. To bridge this gap, we develop the Watchdog-Max strategy, motivated by the slow decay of dominant component magnitudes. Instead of evaluating the full mapping, Watchdog-Max identifies and tracks only two coordinates at each extragradient step, dramatically reducing per-iteration cost while retaining strong practical performance. We establish convergence guarantees and rate analyses for all proposed methods. In particular, Greedy Mini-EG achieves enhanced convergence rates that surpass the classical guarantees of the vanilla EG method in several standard application settings. Numerical experiments on regularized decentralized logistic regression and compressed sensing show speedups exceeding $13\\times$ compared with the classical EG method on both synthetic and real datasets."}

In a previous study (Kuto, 2015), the first author analyzed one of these shadow systems in one space dimension (the second shadow system) and proved that a component of a bifurcating branch blows up as the bifurcation parameter approaches the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of $-Δ$. In the present paper, using a new approach based on suitable transformations and the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we derive the existence and detailed asymptotic structure of several branches of positive steady states near blow-up points for shadow systems with one or two cross-diffusion terms, in both one- and multi-dimensional domains.

Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters.

Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed. New algorithms significantly improve the approximation accuracy of low resolution daily temperature measurements obtained at the Stockholm Old Astronomical Observatory, thereby enhancing the reliability of temperature predictions."}

Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\\cos(2 πx)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\\ell= c$, where $1\\leq k,\\ell \\leq N$.

This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy.

Split federated learning (SFL)-based fine-tuning leverages distributed data while keeping raw data local and reduces client-side burden by partitioning the model between client and server. However, the per-round training latency is dominated by stragglers. Training paradigms featuring parallel gradient transmission (GT) allocate dedicated portions of downlink communication resources to each client. They may leave resources idle and suffer from prolonged GT latency, especially in UAV networks, where the communication latency typically far exceeds the computation latency. To address this, we propose a sequential GT paradigm, where the server dedicates all downlink resources for the current GT. We further propose communication-pipelined SFL (CPSFL), characterized by downlink GT priority scheduling and intra-round asynchronous training. We investigate CPSFL-based LoRA fine-tuning of FMs in UAV networks and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of per-round training latency and worst-case client energy consumption by optimizing the split point selection (SPS) and the computing and communication resource allocation (CCRA) (the uplink bandwidth allocation and the server computing frequency allocation). To solve this problem, we develop an attention-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where the base station agent decides the split point and the CCRA in each round by leveraging previous round information, including UAV trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based CPSFL scheme outperforms the parallel GT benchmarks, the ablation variants, the fixed CCRA scheme, while approaching the best fixed-SPS scheme."}

This classical result coined the term Tchakaloff quadrature for quadrature that is exact and only uses non-negative weights. It has been a long-standing endeavor, under which conditions such rules exist. A final answer was given in 2012 by Bisgaard with the insight that, in fact, every finite-dimensional space of integrable functions on a positive measure space admits them. In this article we recall this result and provide a major extension to the question of positive discretizability of $\\mathbb{C}$-linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces. We introduce the notion of strict $S$-positivity for such functionals, where $S$ are subsets of the functional's domain, and show the equivalence of positive discretizability to being strictly $S$-positive for a suitable choice of $S$. We further investigate consequences for other discretization problems.

The key technical features of RIS are discussed, including design principles, antenna tilt configurations, new beam types, and beam tracking mechanisms. In addition, we examine the impact of highfrequency bands and their absorption peaks on signal attenuation. The paper further explores network architecture designs aimed at improving UAV signal coverage, facilitating network coexistence, and supporting RIS-enhanced UAV sensing. Field trial results evaluating the effectiveness of RIS in improving UAV coverage are presented. Finally, we outline future technological trends and highlight potential advancements to further optimize UAV communication systems. We also emphasize the importance of engineering implementation and standardization efforts in RIS-based UAV-ISAC networks."}

A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure."}

This model captures nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation in biological media and accounts for the experimentally observed power-law attenuation. We begin by extending the existing well-posedness theory for time-fractional equations to include inhomogeneous Neumann boundary data used as control inputs, which requires constructing an appropriate data extension and regularization.

When the function is produced by a spanning set of fractional power functions, traditional quadrature rules often need to be revised, failing to provide exact evaluations for fractional power functions and thus introducing approximation errors. In this paper, we have formulated a fractional quadrature rule that achieves exact integration for functions within this specific set to address this issue. Some properties of the fractional quadrature rule have been proved, and the absolute error bound in the proposed fractional quadrature rule has been derived. The behavior of roots of the orthogonal Müntz polynomial has also been observed for its application as nodes in the fractional quadrature rule. To illustrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed fractional quadrature rule, we focus on fractional differential equations that incorporate the left Caputo fractional derivative. In this context, Müntz-Legendre scaling functions are utilized to approximate the Caputo derivative of functions involved in these equations. Additionally, we have derived an operational matrix for Riemann-Liouville integration to approximate the respective functions with the help of the fractional quadrature rule. To demonstrate the practical utility of our method, we provide illustrative examples that compare the $L_2$-error estimates in the solutions of fractional differential equations using our approach against those obtained with the Block-pulse method.

By expressing the Hill estimator of the target EVI as a ratio of means, we apply approximate control variates to both numerator and denominator, with jointly optimized coefficients that guarantee variance reduction without introducing bias. We show theoretically and through simulations that the asymptotic relative variance reduction of the transferred Hill estimator is proportional to the tail dependence between the target and source variables and independent of their EVI values.

These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal.

A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error.

To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new two-layer MA array (TL-MA), where the positions of MAs are jointly determined by the large-scale movement of multiple subarrays and the small-scale fine-tuning of per-subarray MAs. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the TL-MA-aided communication system by jointly optimizing the subarray-positions, per-subarray (relative) MA positions, and receive beamforming. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which alternately optimizes the positions of subarrays and per-subarray MAs, given the optimal receive beamforming. Numerical results verify that the proposed TL-MA significantly reduces the sum-displacement of MA motors (i.e., the total moving distances of all motors) of element-wise SL-MA, while achieving comparable rate performance."}

This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework. We test the proposed PAS-Net on three different problems: (i) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, (ii) a nonlinear diffusion-reaction system with sharp spatial gradients, and (iii) a two-dimensional eikonal equation.

In this paper, we prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $χ(F)=r+1\\ge 4$, if $m$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $λ(G)\\le \\sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular complete $r$-partite graph. This settles an open problem proposed by Yu and Li [52] and also gives spectral bounds for graphs forbidding books and wheels.\n  Secondly, we establish an asymptotic formula and structural characterization when we forbid an almost-bipartite graph $F$, where $F$ is called almost-bipartite if it can be made bipartite by removing at most one edge. As applications, we determine the unique $m$-edge spectral extremal graph for every integer $m$ when avoiding certain substructures, including complete bipartite graphs plus an edge, cycles plus an edge, and theta graphs, etc. Our results resolve an open problem proposed by Li, Zhao and Zou [24], as well as two conjectures posed by Liu and Li [31]. The arguments in our proofs are based on the edge-spectral stability method recently established by the authors. In addition, we develop some new spectral techniques, including the stability result for the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector."}

This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept. Finally, we summarize open challenges and future research directions toward building trustworthy, quantum-resilient, and adaptive GenAI-enabled 6G networks."}

Power flow controllers (PFCs) that adjust effective line reactances to redistribute flows are often viewed as an interim solution to improve transmission network utilization. Traditional flexibility metrics and analysis approaches for PFCs focus on a limited number of operating points and contingencies. Towards gaining system-wide insights, this paper introduces a framework to quantify network flow controllability- the extent to which line flows can be reshaped through reactance adjustments. We derive analytical results demonstrating that installing PFCs on all lines enables complete controllability of feasible flow patterns. Building on these, we conduct empirical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system to examine how controllability varies with the number of PFCs and their reactance adjustment range. These analyses employ a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the siting and sizing of PFCs. Finally, we validate findings under AC power flow physics using an optimization routine that steers flows toward desired setpoints."}

This classical result coined the term Tchakaloff quadrature for quadrature that is exact and only uses non-negative weights. It has been a long-standing endeavor, under which conditions such rules exist. A final answer was given in 2012 by Bisgaard with the insight that, in fact, every finite-dimensional space of integrable functions on a positive measure space admits them. In this article we recall this result and provide a major extension to the question of positive discretizability of $\\mathbb{C}$-linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces. We introduce the notion of strict $S$-positivity for such functionals, where $S$ are subsets of the functional's domain, and show the equivalence of positive discretizability to being strictly $S$-positive for a suitable choice of $S$. We further investigate consequences for other discretization problems. One fundamental implication is the guaranteed existence of $L_p$-Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund equalities in finite-dimensional spaces of $p$-integrable functions in case that $p$ is an even integer, another the exact discretizability of any frame in $\\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\\mathbb{K}\\in\\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\}$, if a rescaling of the frame elements is allowed.

In the statistical jet bundle $E=\\mathbb{R}\\times L^2(μ)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_θ$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy. The resulting framework links variance bounds, curvature, and estimator efficiency through the geometry of Cartan distributions, offering a new differential equation and connection-theoretic interpretation of higher-order information inequalities."}

Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation.

The underlying idea is to describe solutions of Gelfand problems via suitably defined constrained problems of free boundary-type arising in plasma physics and to replace the usual $L^\\infty$ norm of the solution with the energy of the plasma. Toward this goal, we first solve a long standing open problem of independent interest about the uniqueness of solutions of Grad-Shafranov type equations. Thus, we exploit these unique solutions to detect a curve containing both minimal and non minimal solutions of the associated Gelfand problem. In other words we come up with a new global parametrization of the Rabinowitz continuum, the monotonicity of the energy along the branch providing a meaningful generalization of the classical pointwise monotonicity property of minimal solutions, suitable to describe non minimal solutions as well. On a ball in any dimension, we come up as expected with a bell-shaped profile of the full branch of solutions of the Gelfand problem."}

These two aspects have posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since \\cite{LX}, the study of the entropy wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-order terms become too slow to close the {\\it a priori} assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system.

This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate.

To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints.

These estimates hold under suitable conditions on the data and the convex Monge-Ampère potential is assumed to have Hessian determinant bounded between two positive constants. As an application, we obtain the solvability in all dimensions of the second boundary value problem for a class of singular fourth-order Abreu type equations that arise from the approximation analysis of variational problems subject to convexity constraints."}

We establish the strong $\\mathrm L^1_{\\mathrm{loc}}$-convergence of weak solutions $u_\\varepsilon$ toward the entropy-admissible solution of the corresponding local conservation law as the kernel $γ_\\varepsilon$ concentrates to a Dirac delta distribution when $\\varepsilon \\searrow 0$. In contrast to previous literature, we obtain compactness of the family $\\{u_\\varepsilon \\ast γ_\\varepsilon\\}_{\\varepsilon>0}$ without relying on total variation bounds or Oleĭnik-type estimates. Instead, we establish $\\mathrm L^2$-type bounds on its entropy production and use the theory of compensated compactness, assuming that the initial datum merely belongs to $\\mathrm L^1\\cap \\mathrm L^\\infty$. Our results are twofold. First, we establish the nonlocal-to-local limit for the piecewise constant kernel $γ(\\cdot) := {1}_{[-1,0]}(\\cdot)$ combined with the affine velocity function from Greenshields' traffic model. Second, we prove the limit for strictly monotone kernels along with decreasing velocity functions. These results settle a long-standing open problem concerning the nonlocal-to-local convergence for non-convex kernels."}

In particular, we prove the existence of far-from-equilibrium patterns exhibiting branch-switching and discontinuities in the nondiffusive components, which cannot occur in classical reaction-diffusion equations. While previous work has linked DDI to instability in the purely nondiffusive subsystem -- thereby destabilizing all regular Turing patterns -- we show that DDI can also arise from subsystems involving nondiffusive and slow-diffusive components. This leads to simple sufficient conditions for DDI in systems with arbitrary numbers of components. Further, we fully classify all possible sources of DDI in the case of two diffusive and one nondiffusive component, illustrating our results with a receptor-based model supported by numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of pattern formation, demonstrating how coupling between diffusive and nondiffusive dynamics can generate patterns beyond the reach of the classical reaction-diffusion framework."}

Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \\emph{modified} energy \\[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \\fracη{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,ρ(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \\textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \\emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D."}

This solves a simple version of the conjecture concerning the nonlinear fluctuation phenomenon, proposed by [Giacomin, Lebowitz, Presutti; Math. Surveys Monogr., 1999]. Furthermore, we prove a multi-scale dynamical large deviations in a small noise regime.

By viewing diffusion as a noisy information channel, we measure how mutual information about set membership decays over time. This decay rate is shown to be determined by the boundary measure of the set, leading to a new proof of the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality with its sharp constant. The method extends to Riemannian manifolds satisfying curvature-dimension conditions, yielding Levy-Gromov and Gaussian isoperimetric results within a single analytic principle. Quantitative and stability bounds follow from refined entropy inequalities linking information loss to geometric rigidity. The approach connects geometric analysis and information theory, revealing how entropy dissipation encodes the geometry of diffusion and boundary."}

In this work, we study Neumann boundary and distributed control problems for tracking a prescribed pressure field governed by the Westervelt equation with time-fractional dissipation. This model captures nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation in biological media and accounts for the experimentally observed power-law attenuation. We begin by extending the existing well-posedness theory for time-fractional equations to include inhomogeneous Neumann boundary data used as control inputs, which requires constructing an appropriate data extension and regularization. Using these analytical results for the forward problem, we prove the existence of globally optimal controls and analyze the stability of the optimization problem with respect to perturbations in the target pressure field and to vanishing regularization parameters. Finally, we investigate the associated adjoint equation, which has state-dependent coefficients, and use it to derive first-order necessary optimality conditions."}
