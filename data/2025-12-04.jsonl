The new method integrates temporal encoding, operator learning and UNet to approximate the mapping between vector spaces of random parameter and spatiotemporal flow fields. The new discrete neural operator can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the SOTA attention-residual-UNet structure. Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set."}

The integrator is designed for finite-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems that derive from variational principles. The action is discretized using quadratic finite elements interpolation of the state and Simpson's quadrature, leading to discrete motion equations. The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method."}

Such insider threats can severely undermine cooperative systems: subtle deviations may degrade collective performance, jeopardize mission success, and compromise operational safety. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating insider threats in cooperative control settings. We introduce an insider-aware, game-theoretic formulation in which the insider's hidden intention is parameterized, allowing the threat identification task to be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. To address this challenge, we employ an online indirect dual adaptive control approach that simultaneously infers the insider's control strategy and counteracts its negative influence. By injecting properly designed probing signals, the resulting mitigation policy asymptotically recovers the nominal optimal control law - one that would be achieved under full knowledge of the insider's objective. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification-mitigation framework and illustrate its capability to preserve team performance even in the presence of covert adversarial behavior."}

In this paper, we provide a stochastic analytic proof of the formula for the invariant measures. Our approach starts from the Gaussian invariant measure for the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. We approximate the inhomogeneous problem by a homogeneous one with a singular boundary potential. Using tools including change of measure, time reversal for Markov processes, and Itô's formula, we then reduce the problem to analyzing the KPZ nonlinearity in a thin boundary layer. Finally, using the theory of regularity structures, we establish a central limit theorem for the time-integrated nonlinearity near the boundary, which completes the proof of the invariance. Although it is known that different boundary parameters give rise to distinct physical regimes for the invariant measures, our method is robust and does not rely on any particular choice of boundary parameters."}

Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies.

In this paper, we provide a stochastic analytic proof of the formula for the invariant measures. Our approach starts from the Gaussian invariant measure for the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. We approximate the inhomogeneous problem by a homogeneous one with a singular boundary potential. Using tools including change of measure, time reversal for Markov processes, and Itô's formula, we then reduce the problem to analyzing the KPZ nonlinearity in a thin boundary layer. Finally, using the theory of regularity structures, we establish a central limit theorem for the time-integrated nonlinearity near the boundary, which completes the proof of the invariance. Although it is known that different boundary parameters give rise to distinct physical regimes for the invariant measures, our method is robust and does not rely on any particular choice of boundary parameters."}

Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.\n  We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.\n  Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM."}

This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves."}

While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the \"Parity Barrier\", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the \"Null Hypothesis\") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a \"Prime Desert\", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \\le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth."}

To solve this bilevel program, it is generally necessary to transform it into some single-level optimization problem. One approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT conditions to transform the bilevel program as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Another approach is to apply the lower-level Wolfe/Mond-Weir/extended Mond-Weir duality to transform the bilevel program into some duality-based single-level reformulations, called WDP, MDP, and eMDP respectively in the literature. In this paper, inspired by a conjecture from a recent publication that the tighter feasible region of a reformulation, the better its numerical performance, we present three new duality-based single-level reformulations, called TWDP/TMDP/eTMDP, with tighter feasible regions. Our main goal is to compare all above-mentioned reformulations by designing some direct and relaxation algorithms with projection and implementing these algorithms on 450 test examples generated randomly. Our numerical experiments show that, whether overall comparison or pairwise comparison, at least in our tests, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations were always better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations were always the worst ones among six duality-based reformulations, which indicates that the above conjecture is incorrect. In particular, for the relaxation algorithms, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations performed 3-5 times better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations performed 2 times better than the MPCC reformulation."}

In this paper, we introduce three new categorical theories for partiality: local categories, partial categories, and inclusion categories. The objects of a local category are partially accessible resources, and morphisms are processes between these resources. In a partial category, partiality is addressed via two operators, restriction and contraction, which control the domain of definition of a morphism. Finally, an inclusion category is a category equipped with a family of monics which axiomatize the inclusions between sets. The main result of this paper shows that restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to local categories, that partial categories are $2$-equivalent to inclusion categories, and that both restriction/local categories are $2$-equivalent to bounded partial/inclusion categories. Our result offers four equivalent ways to describe partiality: on morphisms, via restriction categories; on objects, with local categories; operationally, with partial categories; and via inclusions, with inclusion categories. We also translate several key concepts from restriction category theory to the local category context, which allows us to show that various special kinds of restriction categories, such as inverse categories, are $2$-equivalent to their analogous kind of local categories. In particular, the equivalence between inverse (restriction) categories and inverse local categories is a generalization of the celebrated Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad theorem for inverse semigroups."}

The proposed third-medium formulation embeds a fictitious medium (or third medium) between potentially interacting bodies, enabling a unified and robust treatment of hyperelastic contact and self-contact without the need for discretization of the contact interface. Unlike the widely studied two-dimensional problem, this paper extends the new regularization term given in Reference \\cite{TMCWriggers2} to three-dimensional problems and ensures element quality in a third medium. Due to the need for higher-order elements for the regularization term, this paper details the linearization process of this problem within the finite element framework. In addition, pneumatically actuated systems are considered by introducing a pneumatic term to represent pneumatic loading (pressure or suction) and inducing contact caused by internal inflation. This approach is suitable for complex hyperelastic contact and self-contact, and has potential applications in the fields of soft robotics and flexible mechanisms. The framework is developed in a fully three-dimensional setting, making it also suitable for isogeometric methods and meshless methods.

However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods."}

This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.\n  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence.

However, the gapless dispersion relation of graphene at the Dirac points limits the possibility of using pristine graphene instead of traditional semiconductors in Field Effect Transistors (FET). For such a reason very accurate simulations are needed.\n  In Nastasi & Romano, IEEE TED (2021) a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) has been proposed and simulated adopting a drift-diffusion model. Here, electron devices whose active area is made of monolayer graphene are simulated adopting as mathematical model the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) in the bipolar case, coupled with the Poisson equation for the electric field. The system is solved by means of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach (see Cockburn & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (1998); Hesthaven & Warburton, 2008) with linear elements in the spatial coordinate and constant approximation for the wave-vector space, discretized with a polar mesh. The correct physical range for the distribution function is preserved with the maximum-principle-satisfying scheme introduced in Zhang & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (2010).\n  The adopted method reveals very robust and possesses a good degree of accuracy, making it particularly well suited for capturing the complex charge transport dynamics inherent to graphene-based devices.

As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot."}

The resulting optimal control is then applied to the original nonlinear stochastic dynamics until the next sampling instant. This construction leads to a delayed SMPC scheme whose closed-loop behavior is governed by a coupled time-delay SDE system, a setting that has not been analyzed before. We prove global mean-square exponential stability for linear and mildly nonlinear SDEs by exploiting the exponential convergence of the Riccati equation to the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). For strongly nonlinear SDEs, we establish local mean-square exponential stability by combining exponential Riccati convergence with stopping-time techniques and Grönwall-type estimates. It is observed that, to ensure the desired local stability properties, the nonlinearities of the SDE are allowed to have polynomial growth but not exponential growth, distinguishing SMPC from its deterministic counterpart.\n  These results provide the first rigorous mean-square stability guarantees for SMPC of SDE systems with delayed state information, thereby advancing the theoretical foundations of stochastic predictive control."}

Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.\n  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product.

Inf. Theory", "summary": "This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity."}

In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities."}

This adaptive approach facilitates the conveyance of extra bits to the receiver, which means it needs less cost of radio-frequency chains at transmitter while improving SE. Besides, the proposed schemes offer an inherent PLS security advantage, as the eavesdropper is unable to completely detect signals reflected from the RIS. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed RASM and RASSK schemes, this paper presents a detailed analytical performance of their spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate, which are accompanied by insightful findings and conclusions. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes, showcasing their improved error performance and robustness against wiretapping, while also highlighting the potential of the RASM and RASSK schemes for future wireless applications."}

We prove that light rays in three-dimensional Euclidean space correspond to Reeb orbits in a five-dimensional contact manifold, which are then projected onto a four-dimensional symplectic manifold via symplectic reduction. Leveraging the advantages of phase space, we provide a rigorous definition of caustic surfaces as singularities of the Lagrangian submanifold projection and derive explicit expressions for caustic surfaces in convex lens systems. Furthermore, based on singularity theory, we present a complete classification of stable caustic surfaces and establish a correspondence with classical Seidel aberration theory. Building upon this theory, we propose a method of \\emph{topological optical correction} that overcomes the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms in dealing with complex caustic structures. This work provides a new mathematical paradigm for the design and correction of high-precision optical systems."}

This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets."}

We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions.

To handle the curl free involutions arising in the solid limit of the model, the original system is augmented by adopting a thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach. Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits.\n  The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems."}

We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings.

For both RIS and FIS, we consider surfaces with a diagonal reflection matrix, named diagonal RIS/FIS, and surfaces with a reflection matrix not limited to being diagonal, named beyond-diagonal RIS/FIS. Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance."}

Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions."}

We propose a peak inference method that first subjects observed peaks to a significance test of the null hypothesis that no signal is present, and then uses the peaks that are declared significant to construct post-selectively valid confidence regions for the location and height of nearby true peaks. We analyze the performance of this method in a smooth signal plus constant variance noise model under a high-curvature asymptotic assumption, and prove that it asymptotically controls both the number of false discoveries, and the number of confidence regions that do not contain a true peak, relative to the number of points at which inference is conducted. An important intermediate theoretical result uses the Kac-Rice formula to derive a novel approximation to the intensity function of a point process that counts local maxima, which is second-order accurate under the alternative, nearby high-curvature true peaks."}

This study develops an efficient hybrid metaheuristic to solve the integrated dial-a-ride problem by utilizing electric vehicles to minimize operational costs and customer travel time. Customer transfer inconvenience is restricted by a maximum intermodal transfer time to synchronize demand-responsive buses' arrival and transit departures. The proposed metaheuristic addresses the challenges of integrating demand-responsive vehicle routing and charging operations with fixed-route transit systems with capacitated charging stations and partial recharge. We benchmarked our algorithm against a state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming solver on instances with 10-50 customers and two transit lines. Our approach achieves solutions that are, on average, 23.8% better in solution quality within around 2 minutes, outperforming those obtained by the solver using an 8-hour computational time limit. We evaluate the impact of various system parameters to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results suggest that, from the operator's perspective, while the integrated dial-a-ride service reduces vehicle kilometers traveled, the used fleet size may not necessarily be reduced when ensuring high-quality service for passengers. Moreover, operating the integrated systems is more beneficial in areas with dense transit networks, compared with increases in transit frequency.

This formulation is then enhanced to incorporate the vanishing tangential trace constraint directly into a mesh-dependent cost functional, rather than enforcing it in the solution's function space. In this context, we define a mesh-dependent norm and provide an error analysis based on this norm. We employ the collocation method by collocating the stochastic equation at the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials. This approach leads to a system of uncoupled deterministic problems, simplifying computation.

In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH)."}

We introduce a novel greedy framework for the optimal selection of indirect measurements in the operator codomain, specifically tailored to inverse problems. Our approach employs a two-step scheme combining kernel-based interpolation and extrapolation. Within this framework, greedy schemes can be residual-based, where points are selected according to the current approximation error for a specific target function, or error-based, where points are chosen using a priori error indicators independent of the residual. For the latter, we derive explicit error bounds that quantify the propagation of approximation errors through both interpolation and extrapolation. Numerical applications to solar hard X-ray imaging demonstrate that the proposed greedy sampling strategy achieves high-quality reconstructions using only a few available measurements."}

The SCHMM captures the stochastic network behavior in real time, while LMPC ensures consensus and optimality via Linear Matrix Inequalities LMIs. The developed optimal control problem simultaneously minimizes three elements. First, the control effort is reduced to avoid aggressive inputs and second, the network induced error caused by time delays and packet dropouts. Third, the topology-induced error, as the distributed graph restricts agents access to global information. This error is inherent to the communication graph and cannot be addressed through offline learning. To overcome this, the study also introduces the incremental Expectation Maximization EM algorithm, enabling online learning of the SCHMM. This adaptation allows the framework to mitigate both network and topology errors while maintaining optimality through MPC. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHMM LMPC, demonstrating adaptability in multi agent systems with diverse topologies."}

In 2021, Glock, Kühn, and Osthus proposed a generalization of this result. Namely they conjectured a hypergraph version of Nash-Williams' Conjecture positing that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has minimum $(r-1)$-degree (denoted $δ(G)$ hereafter) at least $\\left(1-Θ_r\\left(\\frac{1}{q^{r-1}}\\right)\\right) \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition.\n  The best known progress on this conjecture dates to the second proof of the Existence Conjecture by Glock, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus wherein they showed that $δ(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{2r}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for large enough $n$, where $c$ is a constant depending on $r$ but not $q$. As for the fractional relaxation, the best known bound is due to Delcourt, Lesgourgues, and the second author, who proved that $δ(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ guarantees a $K_q^r$-fractional decomposition.\n  We prove that for every integer $r\\ge 2$, there exists a real $c>0$ such that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ satisfies $δ(G)\\ge \\max\\left\\{ δ_{K_q^r}^* + \\varepsilon,~~1 -\\frac{c}{\\binom{q}{r-1}} \\right\\} \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition for all large enough $n$, where $δ_{K_q^r}^*$ denotes the fractional $K_q^r$-decomposition threshold. Combined with the fractional result above, this proves that $\\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for the Hypergraph Nash-Williams' Conjecture, approximately confirming the correct order of $q$. Our proof uses the newly developed method of refined absorption; we also develop a non-uniform Turán theory to prove the existence of many embeddings of absorbers which may be of independent interest."}

However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect."}

We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults."}

This new family is combinatorially rich and contains as special cases various families of combinatorial objects that are frequently studied in the literature, as is the case of permutations, circular permutations, multipermutations, Stirling permutations, Catalan objects and their generalizations. When permutation flows are decorated with compatible shuffles, they also include the combinatorics of parking functions and their generalizations.\n  This model is geometrically rich. We show that permutation flow shuffles define a family of unimodular triangulations of the flow polytope $F_G(a)$ on $G$ with an integer balanced netflow vector a where only the last entry is negative. As an application we provide a new proof of the Lidskii volume formula of Baldoni and Vergne for this family of polytopes and a reformulation of the same formula where every term is explained by the nature of the combinatorial objects involved. Permutation flow triangulations extend the Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy triangulations that were defined for the case where a=e_0-e_n. We provide a formula for the h^*-polynomial of the flow polytope as the descent enumerating polynomial of permutation flows.\n  The model comes with an order structure induced by intuitive operators on permutation flows which we call the weak order. This order includes as special cases the weak order on permutations, the Tamari lattice, order ideals in Young's lattice, and their generalizations, among others. It was conjectured in 2020 by the three authors, together with Benedetti, Harris, and Morales, that this poset is in general a lattice.

While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues.

This paper investigates an OEM's optimal remanufacturing business model by incorporating consumer perceptions into price and production quantity decisions. We analyze three alternative models: no remanufacturing, OEM in-house remanufacturing, and third-party remanufacturer (TPR) authorized remanufacturing. We extend the authorization with a two-part tariff contract and consider a stochastic market size. Through a numerical approach, we optimize price and quantity decisions based on consumer perceptions and develop a hierarchical decision roadmap to guide model selection. Our findings show that when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is high, OEM in-house remanufacturing is most profitable and reduces environmental impacts, but generally leads to a market dominated by remanufactured products. In contrast, when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is moderate and TPR remanufacturing significantly increases the perceived value of new products, the TPR-authorized remanufacturing is most profitable. It typically boosts total market sales, but accordingly increases environmental impacts. In addition, sensitivity analysis indicates that two-part authorization contracts are more advanced in meeting stringent environmental requirements than one-part contracts. Incorporating market size stochasticity enhances system profitability while keeping environmental impacts within a limited scope."}

While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the \"Parity Barrier\", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the \"Null Hypothesis\") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a \"Prime Desert\", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \\le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth."}

To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts."}

This paper proposes the Penalty-Free SDDP, an extension that introduces a Future Feasibility Function alongside the traditional Future Cost Function. The new recursion handles infeasibilities automatically, distinguishing between temporary and truly infeasible cases, and propagates feasibility information across stages through dedicated feasibility cuts. The approach was validated in a large-scale deterministic case inspired by the Brazilian hydrothermal system, achieving equivalent feasibility to the benchmark solution while eliminating miscalibrated artificial penalties.

And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems.

In particular, control loops in compressor-plenum-throttle systems cannot tolerate costly interruptions, and aggressive excitation may lead to unsafe operating regimes. Given the wide availability of historical data, this paper introduces a counterfactual explainability approach for sample-efficient retuning of compressor control loops. The proposed data-driven algorithm determines, without an explicit plant model or previous control law, the smallest controller adjustment required to achieve predefined performance specifications while guaranteeing stability. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of Cauchy problems for weak solutions to second-order degenerate parabolic equations with a non-smooth, time-dependent degenerate elliptic part that includes both bounded and unbounded lower-order terms. The unbounded lower-order terms are allowed to lie in mixed time-space Lebesgue or even Lorentz spaces. Our notion of weak solutions is formulated under minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions. We also establish $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates for the fundamental solution and derive Gaussian upper bounds under the weak assumption of Moser's $L^2$-$L^\\infty$ estimates for weak solutions. Our approach is purely variational and avoids any a priori regularity assumptions on weak solutions or regularization via smooth approximations. Two key ingredients are norm inequalities for fractional powers of the degenerate Laplacian, and a set of embeddings that ensure time continuity of weak solutions, extending the classical Lions regularity theorem and accommodating a wide class of source terms."}

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop\" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery."}

An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings. Together, these results build a principled framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing of s-MoE in AI models."}

Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering."}

Therefore, it is of interest to terminate the optimization algorithm as soon as the underlying data science task is accomplished. We consider FISTA for solving two binary classification problems: the ellipsoid separation problem (ESP), and the soft-margin support-vector machine (SVM). For the ESP, we cast the dual second-order cone program into a form amenable to FISTA and show that the FISTA residual converges to the infimal displacement vector of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, that directly encodes a separating hyperplane. We further derive a data-dependent iteration upper bound scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(1/δ_{\\mathcal{A}}^2)$, where $δ_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is the minimal perturbation that destroys separability. For the SVM, we propose a strongly-concave perturbed dual that admits efficient FISTA updates under a linear time projection scheme, and with our parameter choices, the objective has small condition number, enabling rapid convergence. We prove that, under a reasonable data model, early-stopped iterates identify well-classified points and yield a hyperplane that exactly separates them, where the accuracy required of the dual iterate is governed by geometric properties of the data. In particular, the proposed early-stopping criteria diminish the need for hard-to-select tolerance-based stopping conditions. Our numerical experiments on ESP instances derived from MNIST data and on soft-margin SVM benchmarks indicate competitive runtimes and substantial speedups from stopping early."}

Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches.

The model admits a mean-field interpretation, as each producer's decisions both influence and are influenced by the aggregate behaviour of all others. We show that the equilibrium price process can be expressed as a nonlinear functional of the exogenous base demand, leading to a three-dimensional singular stochastic control problem for each producer.

There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy\" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system."}

We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown.

Quantised training addresses this by representing training components in low-bit integers, but typically relies on discretising real-valued updates. We introduce an alternative approach where the update rule itself is discrete, avoiding the quantisation of continuous updates by design. We establish convergence guarantees for a general class of such discrete schemes, and present a multinomial update rule as a concrete example, supported by empirical evaluation. This perspective opens new avenues for efficient training, particularly for models with inherently discrete structure."}

However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural \"parallelization\" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems."}

Our main subject is spectral properties of the Frechet derivatives of steady water Stokes waves. One of main results is the absence of subharmonic water waves in a neighborhood of a Stokes wave. The main assumption is formulated in terms of the eigenvalues of the Frechet derivative evaluated at this wave and considered in the class of periodic solutions of the same period. The first eigenvalue is always negative. We show that if the second eigenvalue is positive then there are no waves with multiple periods in a neighborhood of the Stokes wave."}

Given a Lie algebroid pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a Lie algebroid $L$ together with a Lie subalgebroid $A$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations of $(L,A)$ modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations of $L$ and those from the exponentials of inner derivations of $L$, respectively. For the associated two deformation functors, we find the associated governing $L_\\infty$-algebras in the sense of extended deformation theory. Furthermore, when $(L,A)$ is a matched Lie pair, i.e. the quotient $L/A$ is also a Lie subalgebroid of $L$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations along the normal direction $L/A$. The extended deformation theory of the associated deformation functor recovers the formal deformation theory of complex structures and that of transversely holomorphic foliations."}

While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization."}
