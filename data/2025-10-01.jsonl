The framework systematically converts\noptimal control frameworks into two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs)\nwhile establishing a multi-task learning paradigm through innovative\nintegration of the Euler-Lagrange theorem with deep learning architecture. An\nadaptive loss weighting mechanism dynamically balances loss function components\nduring training, decreasing tedious manual tuning of weighting the loss\nfunctions compared to the conventional physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs). Based on six numerical examples, it's clear that AW-EL-PINNs achieve\nenhanced solution accuracy compared to baseline methods while maintaining\nstability throughout the optimization process.

The ACPS combines algebraic\nmanipulation with iterative refinement to achieve greater accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency than mainstream methods. By incorporating principles\nfrom both fractional calculus and functional analysis, the method offers a\nflexible framework capable of addressing a wide range of fractional equations,\nfrom linear to highly nonlinear cases. Additionally, a representative\ncounterexample is provided to indicate that the conformable fractional\nderivative does not fulfill the mathematical criteria for a valid definition of\nfractional differentiation. The Asad Correctional Power Series (ACPS) method is\nemployed to construct an analytic solution of the fractional SIR model in the\nform of a rapidly convergent power series. Its performance is validated through\ncomparisons with the classical fourth-order Runge Kutta method, where both\nnumerical and graphical analyses corroborate the method's precision and\nefficiency. The application of ACPS to the fractional epidemic model highlights\nits ability to capture memory and hereditary effects, offering more realistic\ninsights into disease transmission dynamics than integer-order models. These\nfindings demonstrate that ACPS can serve as a useful tool for solving\nfractional differential equations arising in real world applications"}

Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\\v{s}ek's\nextrapolation that relates the Poincar\\'e constants $\\gamma(G,\\varrho^p)$ and\n$\\gamma(G,\\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 < p,q < \\infty$, any bounded\ndegree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\\mathcal{M}=(M,\\varrho)$.

Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for\nmetric embeddings of graphs.\n  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of\nmetric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear\nspectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality\nof (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on\nthe bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric\nspaces of large cardinality."}

However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:\nsome achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding\nspeed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch\ncomplicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance\nmetrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires\nboth compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present\na mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and\ndecoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and\nbalances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling\nobjective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments\non image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably\nidentifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.\nResults also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide\nsuperior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when\nspeed is paramount.

The\nStochastic LLG (SLLG) equation is a widely used phenomenological model for the\ntime evolution of the magnetization field confined to a ferromagnetic body\nwhile taking into account the effect of random heat perturbations. This\nphenomenon is mathematically formulated as a nonlinear parabolic problem, where\nthe stochastic component is represented as a parameter-dependent datum\ndepending on a non-compact and high-dimensional parameter. In an\n$\\textit{offline}$ phase, we use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on\nhigh-fidelity samples of the unbounded parameter space. To that end, we use the\nso-called $\\textit{tangent plane scheme}$. For the $\\textit{online}$ phase of\nthe RB method, we again employ the tangent plane scheme in the RB space. This\nis possible due to our particular construction that reduces both spaces of the\nmagnetization and of its time derivative. Due to the saddle-point nature of\nthis scheme, a stabilization that appropriately enriches the RB space is\nrequired. Numerical experiments show a clear advantage over earlier approaches\nusing sparse grid interpolation.

The\ndiscussion could be adapted to any hyperbolic system endowed with an entropy,\nbut we focus on compressible fluid mechanics, in its Eulerian and Lagrangian\nformulations. The unifying element is that we systematically express the update\nof conserved variables as $u^{n+1}=u^n- \\Delta t\\; \\delta u$, where the\nfunctional $\\delta u$ depends on the value of $u$ in the stencil of the scheme.\nThen, one can naturally define a graph connecting the states defining $\\delta\nu$.

We are\naware of only two possible situations: either the graph is constructed from the\nfaces of the mesh elements (or the dual mesh), or it is defined from the mesh\nitself. Two notions of local conservation then emerge: either we define a\nnumerical flux, or we define a \"residual\" attached to elements and the degrees\nof freedom within the element. We show that this two notions are in a way\nequivalent, but the one with residual allows much more flexibility, especially\nif additional algebraic constraints must be satisfied.

In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation\ndynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth\nor decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be\nassessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however,\na rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when\ntrying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear\ntime-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local\nlinearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper\nis that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing\nsolutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear\ntime-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying\nsolutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through\nFloquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case."}

We prove that the three regions\nof the phase diagram yield three distinct local limits, a massive Gaussian free\nfield, a massless Gaussian free field plus a random constant, and finally a\n(possibly trivial) mixture of massive Gaussian free fields, where some mass is\n``lost'' to the region of concentration. {Our proof relies on the analysis of\nthe spherical model of a ferromagnet.} The measure under consideration is an\nexponential tilt of the spherical model, and the additional tilt can be seen to\ninduce an additional phase transition."}

A graph $G$ is considered to be rainbow under an edge-coloring if all\nof its edges have different colors. For a positive integer $n$, the anti-Ramsey\nnumber of a graph $G$, denoted as $AR(n, G)$, represents the maximum number of\ncolors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ without\ncontaining a rainbow copy of $G$. This concept was introduced by Erd\\H{o}s et\nal. in 1975. The anti-Ramsey number for the linear forest $kP_3 \\cup tP_2$ has\nbeen extensively studied for two positive integers $k$ and $t$. Formulations\nexist for specific values of $t$ and $k$, particularly when $k \\geq 2$, $t \\geq\n\\frac{k^2 - k + 4}{2}$, and $n \\geq 3k + 2t + 1$.

We improve upon previous results by constructing\nexplicit codes over \\(\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\\), linear over \\(\\mathbb{F}_q\\), with\nrate \\(1/2 - \\delta - \\varepsilon\\) that can efficiently correct a\n\\(\\delta\\)-fraction of indel errors, where \\(q = O(\\varepsilon^{-4})\\).\nAdditionally, we construct fully linear codes over \\(\\mathbb{F}_q\\) with rate\n\\(1/2 - 2\\sqrt{\\delta} - \\varepsilon\\) that can also efficiently correct\n\\(\\delta\\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of\nlinear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical\nhalf-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every\ncode \\(C \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n\\) linear over \\(\\mathbb{E} \\subset \\mathbb{F}\\)\na subfield of $\\mathbb{F}$, such that \\(C\\) has the ability to correct\n\\(\\delta\\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\\delta)/2$."}

In this Letter, we propose a classical algorithm with a\nquasipolynomial runtime to efficiently approximate the partition function of\nlong-range bosonic systems at high temperatures. For finite-range systems, the\ncomplexity improves to almost polynomial time. We also present a rigorous proof\nfor the power-law decay of correlation functions. This property, known as\nclustering of correlation, is well-established for finite-range spin models.\nHowever, in sharp contrast, has remained largely unexplored for long-range\nbosonic systems. The results presented here address two long-standing gaps\nconcerning the computational complexity and correlation clustering in such\nsystems. The methodology we introduce provides new tools for future studies of\nchallenging problems in statistical and quantum many-body physics concerning\nbosonic system and computational complexity."}

We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called\nBohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the\nstochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic\ndynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical\nsystems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP\nbetween Gaussian distributions.

However, its original form has a significant\nlimitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important\nRL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This\nlimitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost\nsupermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square\nsummable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the\nincrements of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable\ncondition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we\nfurther provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration\nbounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in\nstochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure\nconvergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first\n$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation."}

A systematic study was conducted by\nSadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the\nstorage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$,\ndenoted by $\\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates\nachievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the\nratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper\nmakes the following key contributions.\n  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study\nof PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We\nshrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,\n  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\\mathcal{C}(K_N)\\le 2/(N+1)$ and\nconjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing\nthe strictly stronger bound $\\mathcal{C}(K_N) \\le \\frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also\nimprove the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\\mathcal{C}(K_N)$\nwas $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide\nexplicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_N)\\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\\mathcal{C}(G)\n\\ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.\n  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic\nPIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for\nreducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of\nindependent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that\nperforms particularly well on sparse graphs."}
