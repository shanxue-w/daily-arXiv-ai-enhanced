Visual information\ncaptured by an onboard RGB camera is amplitude-encoded into quantum states,\nwhile channel state observations are mapped into quantum rotation-encoded\nfeatures. These hybrid inputs are processed through variational quantum\ncircuits, enabling ternary classification of the link status. To address the\ninherent imperfections of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, the\nsystem explicitly models depolarizing and dephasing channels along direct and\nQRIS-assisted paths. A fidelity-aware training objective is employed to jointly\nminimize classification loss and quantum state degradation, with amplitude\ndamping and synthetic noise injection enhancing robustness.

While MLE performs well in canonical GLMs, it\ncan become computationally inefficient near the true parameter value. In more\ngeneral settings with non-canonical or fully general link functions, the\nresulting optimization landscape is often non-convex, non-smooth, and\nnumerically unstable. To address these challenges, we investigate an\nalternative estimator based on solving the variational inequality (VI)\nformulation of the GLM likelihood equations, originally proposed by Juditsky\nand Nemirovski as an alternative for solving nonlinear least-squares problems.\nUnlike their focus on algorithmic convergence in monotone settings, we analyze\nthe VI approach from a statistical perspective, comparing it systematically\nwith the MLE. We also extend the theory of VI estimators to a broader class of\nlink functions, including non-monotone cases satisfying a strong Minty\ncondition, and show that it admits weaker smoothness requirements than MLE,\nenabling faster, more stable, and less locally trapped optimization.\nTheoretically, we establish both non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and\nasymptotic normality for the VI estimator, and further provide convergence\nguarantees for fixed-point and stochastic approximation algorithms. Numerical\nexperiments show that the VI framework preserves the statistical efficiency of\nMLE while substantially extending its applicability to more challenging GLM\nsettings."}

This paper presents an ensemble support vector machine surrogate\nfor joint chance constraint optimal power flow, where multiple linear\nclassifiers are trained on simulated optimal power flow data and embedded as\ntractable hyperplane constraints via Big--M reformulations. The surrogate\nyields a polyhedral approximation of probabilistic line flow limits that\npreserves interpretability and scalability. Numerical experiments on the IEEE\n118-bus system show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal costs with a\nnegligible average error of $0.03\\%$. These results demonstrate the promise of\nensemble surrogates as efficient and transparent tools for risk-aware\noptimization of power systems."}

Solution of\nthis subproblem yields information that can be used both to check feasibility\nand to generate strong valid inequalities.

Explicit\nexpressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed\nand the critical exponents $\\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition),\n$\\beta=\\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at\nzero external magnetic field) and $\\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical\ntemperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the\npartition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field\nusing analytic combinatorics."}
