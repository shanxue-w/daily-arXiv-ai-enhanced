Standard Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on\nthese uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often\ndistorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral\nTarget-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular\ngraphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute\nmolecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)\nGromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates\nLaplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;\nand (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates\nwith interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a\nkernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are\nscarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,\nSPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.\nOn benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges\nwhile maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic\nmolecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry.

In particular, it is vital to construct\nnon-trivial and explicit examples of graded Lie groups and their corresponding\ngraded Lie algebras.\n  Three fundamental families of graded Lie groups are developed in this paper:\nthe general linear group associated with any graded vector space, the graded\northogonal group associated with a graded vector space equipped with a metric,\nand the graded symplectic group associated with a graded vector space equipped\nwith a symplectic form. We provide both a direct geometric construction and a\nfunctor-of-points perspective. It is shown that their corresponding Lie\nalgebras are isomorphic to the anticipated subalgebras of the graded Lie\nalgebra of linear endomorphisms. Isomorphisms of graded Lie groups induced by\nlinear isomorphisms, as well as possible applications, are also discussed."}

We focus on Bert den Boer's original Five Card Trick to\ndevelop our approach. Five Card Trick was formulated as a secure two-party\ncomputation method, where two players use colored cards with identical backs to\ncalculate the logical AND operation on the bits that they choose. In this\nmethod, the players first arrange the cards privately, and then shuffle them\nthrough a random cut. Finally, they reveal the shuffled arrangement to\ndetermine the result of the operation. An unbiased random cut is essential to\nprevent players from exposing their chosen bits to each other. However, players\ntypically choose to move cards within the deck even though not moving any cards\nshould be equally likely. This unconscious behavior results in a biased,\nnonuniform shuffling-distribution in the sense that some arrangements of cards\nare slightly more probable after the cut. Such a nonuniform distribution\ncreates an opportunity for a malicious player to gain advantage in guessing the\nother player's choice. We provide the conditional probabilities of such guesses\nas a way to quantify the information leakage. Furthermore, we utilize the\neigenstructure of a Markov chain to derive tight bounds on the number of times\nthe biased random cuts must be repeated to reduce the leakage to an acceptable\nlevel. We also discuss the generalization of our approach to the setting where\nshuffling is conducted by a malicious player."}

Our approach exploits the\nobservation that any random PCP tensor can be derived by marginalizing an\nunobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this\nlarger dimensional tensor, referred to as the \"complete\" loglikelihood, is\ncomprised of multiple rank one PCP loglikelihoods. Using this methodology, we\nfirst derive non-iterative maximum likelihood estimators for the PCP model and\ndemonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix\nand tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we\nderive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model.\nThe Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of\nthe tensor model, such as the role that tensor rank plays in identifiability\nand indeterminacy. For the special case of rank one PCP models, we demonstrate\nthat these results are greatly simplified."}

We also propose a Lagrangian\nformulation, where the network is a traffic plan (that is, a measure on the\nspace of Lipschitz curves) and recovery plans are sub-traffic plans. This\napproach prescribes the network's orientation but allows for a wider class of\ndamages. We prove existence of minimizers in both settings. The two models are\ncompared through examples that illustrate their main differences: the Eulerian\nformulation's necessity for an unoriented network to achieve existence, the\nLagrangian formulation's ability to handle general damages and its requirement\nfor a positive distance between the supports of the source and target measures."}

Several authors have studied the length of a shortest\nself-orthogonal embedding of a given binary code $\\mathcal C$, or equivalently,\nthe minimum number of columns that must be added to a generator matrix of\n$\\mathcal C$ to form a generator matrix of a self-orthogonal code. In this\npaper, we use properties of the hull of a linear code to determine the length\nof a shortest self-orthogonal embedding of any binary linear code. We focus on\nthe examples of Hamming codes and Reed-Muller codes. We show that a shortest\nself-orthogonal embedding of a binary Hamming code is self-dual, and propose\ntwo algorithms to construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes $\\mathcal H_r$.\nUsing these algorithms, we construct a self-dual $[22, 11, 6]$ code, called the\nshortened Golay code, from the binary $[15, 11, 3]$ Hamming code $\\mathcal\nH_4$, and construct a self-dual $[52, 26, 8]$ code from the binary $[31, 26,\n3]$ Hamming code $\\mathcal H_5$. We use shortest SO embeddings of linear codes\nto obtain many inequivalent optimal self-orthogonal codes of dimension $7$ and\n$8$ for several lengths. Four of the codes of dimension $8$ that we construct\nare codes with new parameters such as $[91, 8, 42],\\, [98, 8, 46],\\,[114, 8,\n54]$, and $[191, 8, 94]$."}
