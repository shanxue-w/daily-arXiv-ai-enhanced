To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive\nneural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving\nweak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions\n-- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed\nframework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed\nsubintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence\nand solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and\nenhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients\nwithout explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error\nbounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the\nphysical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical\nexperiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently\noutperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both\naccuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients.\nThese results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization\ntechniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for\nnonlinear hyperbolic systems."}

This model covers a wide range\nof interactions, including the cooperation (attraction) or competition\n(repulsion) of several walks at single vertices. We are principally concerned\nwith strong laws for the proportion of visits to each vertex by all walks. We\nprove that this measure converges almost surely towards the set of fixed points\nof the transition probabilities. Almost sure convergence to a single fixed\npoint is in fact the generic behaviour as we show this to hold for almost all\nparameter values of our model.\n  Beyond almost sure convergence, our model allows for a detailed description\nof the limiting behaviour depending on the interaction parameters and the\nsub-graph geometries. This is illustrated by several examples of the\ncompetitive version of the dynamics, including interacting walks sharing all\nthe vertices of finite complete graphs and walks confined to complete\nsub-graphs of star graphs and cycles."}

In\nthese games, the uniquely optimal strategy for a Bayesian agent upon observing\nthe data is to reveal their prior. As such, the prior chosen by minimax theory\nis, in effect, the implicit prior of minimax agents. Since minimax analysis\ndisregards prior information, this prior is arguably noninformative. We refer\nto minimax solutions of certain prior disclosure games as Bayesimax priors, and\nwe classify a statistical procedure as Bayesimax if it is a Bayes rule with\nrespect to a Bayesimax prior. Under regular conditions, minimax decision rules\nmaximize the minimum Bayes risk. We study games leveraging strictly proper\nscoring rules to induce posterior (and thereby prior) revelation. In such\ngames, the minimum Bayes risk equals the conditional (generalized) entropy of\nthe parameter given the data. In particular, for the logarithmic score a\nBayesimax prior maximizes the conditional Shannon entropy. As conditional\nentropy equals marginal entropy (prior uninformativeness) minus mutual\ninformation (data informativeness), Bayesimax priors effectively minimize total\ninformation. We give a measure-theoretic formulation of these ideas, outline\nsufficient conditions for existence and minimax characterization, and\ninvestigate asymptotics and conjugate-family examples.

The vehicular\nvisible light communication (VVLC) system is a key feature in leveraging\nexisting infrastructures, but it still has several critical challenges.\nEspecially, VVLC channels are highly correlated due to the small gap between\nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) in each headlight, making it difficult to increase\ndata rates by spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we exploit recently\nsynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to reduce the correlation between LEDs,\ni.e., the chiroptical properties of GNPs for differential absorption depending\non the azimuth angle of incident light are used to mitigate the LED\ncorrelation. In addition, we adopt a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\n(SLNR)-based precoder to support multiple users. The ratio of RGB light sources\nin each LED also needs to be optimized to maximize the sum SLNR satisfying a\nwhite light constraint for illumination since the GNPs can vary the color of\ntransmitted light by the differential absorption across wavelength. The\nnonconvex optimization problems for precoders and RGB ratios can be solved by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient with the approximated shot noise and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the\nSLNR-based precoder with the optimized RGB ratios significantly improves the\nsum rate in a multi-user vehicular environment and the secrecy rate in a\nwiretapping scenario.

Common\npractice is for investigators to use all data meeting the inclusion criteria of\ntheir study to perform their analysis. We term this common practice data\ngluttony. It has apparent formal justification insofar as this approach\nmaximizes per-study power. But this comes at a cost: data reuse affects the\nshape of the tail distribution of inferential errors. Using the theory of risk\norderings we demonstrate how positively dependent testing procedures result in\nstrictly riskier distributions of inferential error.\n  We identify two remedies to this state of affairs: research portfolio\noptimization and what we term data temperance. Research portfolio optimization\nrequires that we formulate the enterprise of inference in a utility theoretic\nframework: associated to each hypothesis to be evaluated is some utility\ndependent on its truth as well as the impact of the statistical decision\nrendered on the basis of the data. Under certain models of data governance,\nthis approach can be used to optimally allocate data usage across multiple\ninferential tasks. On the other hand, data temperance is a more flexible\nstrategy for managing the distribution of inferential errors. Data temperance\nis the principle that an investigator use only as much data as is necessary to\nperform the task at hand. This is possible due to the diminishing marginal\nreturns in power and precision in sample size. We analyze the effectiveness of\ndata temperance at reducing the dependence across testing and develop a theory\nof the capacity of a static database to sustain large numbers of inferential\ntasks with low probability of inducing pairwise dependent testing procedures."}

Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize.

When\nrunning such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the\nalgorithm on this input?

The objective of quality control is thus weaker\nthan either component problem: testing for \"$\\rho(x) \\approx 1$\" or testing if\n$x \\sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.\n  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control\nproblem, where $D \\in \\Delta(\\{0,1\\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D\n,\\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time.

Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize.

In the second part, we presented a\nmodified method of variation of parameters utilizing a revised Cramer's rule\nfor addressing a linear system of block matrices.

In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the\ndependence on $\\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition\nof two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the\nforward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables\ncontrol in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL\ndivergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the\ndiscretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the\nlinear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow\nODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions.

Taking into account the differential geometry of\nthe matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we\nfirst generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a\nclassical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a\ndeformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in\nearlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified\nfusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity\n$2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$\nspinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a\nLaughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$\nmatrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum\nskyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what\nappears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains\n$\\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as\ndeformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this\nconstruction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while\nthe entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory\nat level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results\nfor the multiplicative Chern insulator.

One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit\nsolutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,\nwe propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which\nenables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of\nlinear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the\nmulti-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an\napproximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form\nof the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward\nfunction as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional\nnetwork layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which\ncan be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear\nsystem. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly\nrepresent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution\nof a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented\nto provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an\neffective lower bound to the performance of RL policy.
