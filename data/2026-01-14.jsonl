In histopolation, the available input data does not consist of pointwise function samples but of averages taken over intervals or higher-dimensional regions, and these mean values serve as a basis for reconstructing or approximating the target function. While classical interpolation requires continuity of the underlying function, histopolation can be performed in larger function spaces. In the framework of kernel methods, we will introduce and study the so-called averaging kernel Hilbert spaces (AKHS's) for this purpose. Within this setting, we develop systematic construction principles for averaging kernels and provide characterizations based on the Fourier-Plancherel transform. In addition, we analyze several representative histopolation scenarios in order to highlight properties of this approximation method, including conditions for unisolvence and possible error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments that shed some light on the convergence behavior of the presented approach and demonstrate its practical effectiveness."}

It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples."}

Eigenspaces and eigenvalues of rational functions of such operators are studied as a first step. Under an assumption of convergence of resolvent approximations in the operator norm and an assumption on global reliability of source problem error estimators, we show that the gap in eigenspace approximations can be bounded by a globally reliable and computable error estimator. Also included are applications of the theoretical framework to first-order system least squares (FOSLS) discretizations and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) discretizations, both yielding new estimators for the error gap.

In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings."}

Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders."}

This scheme exhibits favorable structural properties that substantially reduce the difficulties arising from coupling and gradient nonlinearities in spatiotemporal HiSD. Exploiting these properties, we establish gradient stability and error estimates, which consequently ensure the preservation of the Morse index for the computed saddle points. The framework is further extended to the semilinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in finding multiple solutions and constructing the solution landscape of semilinear elliptic problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first rigorous full space--time accuracy analysis of the HiSD system.

This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue."}

The classical 2-choices rule is a well-known distributed algorithm designed to achieve this goal. Under this rule, each node in a network updates its opinion at random instants by sampling two neighbours uniformly at random and then adopting the common opinion held by these neighbours if they agree. For a sufficiently well-connected network of $n$ nodes and two initial opinions, this simple rule results in the network being absorbed in a consensus state in $O(\\log n)$ time (with high probability) and the consensus is obtained on the opinion held by the majority of nodes initially.\n  In this paper, we study the robustness of this algorithm to node failures. In particular, we assume that with a constant probability $α$, a node may fail to update according to the 2-choices rule and erroneously adopt any one of the two opinions uniformly at random. This is a strong form of failure under which the network can no longer be absorbed in a consensus state. However, we show that as long as the error probability $α$ is less than a threshold value, the network is able to retain the majority support of the initially prevailing opinion for an exponentially long time ($Ω(\\poly(\\exp(n)))$). In contrast, when the error probability is above a threshold value, we show that any opinion quickly ($O(\\log n)$ time) loses its majority support and the network reaches a state where (nearly) an equal proportion of nodes support each opinion. We establish the above phase transition in the dynamics for both complete graphs and expander graphs with sufficiently large spectral gaps and sufficiently homogeneous degrees.

We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.\n  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.\n  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs."}

The classical 2-choices rule is a well-known distributed algorithm designed to achieve this goal. Under this rule, each node in a network updates its opinion at random instants by sampling two neighbours uniformly at random and then adopting the common opinion held by these neighbours if they agree. For a sufficiently well-connected network of $n$ nodes and two initial opinions, this simple rule results in the network being absorbed in a consensus state in $O(\\log n)$ time (with high probability) and the consensus is obtained on the opinion held by the majority of nodes initially.\n  In this paper, we study the robustness of this algorithm to node failures. In particular, we assume that with a constant probability $α$, a node may fail to update according to the 2-choices rule and erroneously adopt any one of the two opinions uniformly at random. This is a strong form of failure under which the network can no longer be absorbed in a consensus state. However, we show that as long as the error probability $α$ is less than a threshold value, the network is able to retain the majority support of the initially prevailing opinion for an exponentially long time ($Ω(\\poly(\\exp(n)))$). In contrast, when the error probability is above a threshold value, we show that any opinion quickly ($O(\\log n)$ time) loses its majority support and the network reaches a state where (nearly) an equal proportion of nodes support each opinion. We establish the above phase transition in the dynamics for both complete graphs and expander graphs with sufficiently large spectral gaps and sufficiently homogeneous degrees. Our analysis combines spectral graph theory with Markov chain mixing and hitting time analyses."}

Specifically, we define the stratum-restricted regularity property, characterize it by the verifiable weak second order condition (W-SOC) and weak strict Robinson constraint qualification (W-SRCQ), and interpret the W-SRCQ geometrically via transversality, which provides its genericity over ambient space and stability along strata. The interactions of these properties across neighboring strata are further examined, leading to the conclusion that classical strong-form regularity conditions correspond to the local uniform validity of stratum-restricted counterparts. On the algorithmic side, a stratified Gauss--Newton method with normal steps and a correction mechanism is proposed for globally solving the KKT equation through a least-squares merit function. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges globally to directional stationary points.

Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes\" and ``parts\" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $Δ^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $Δ^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $Δ^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $Δ^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $Δ^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $Δ^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $Δ^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $Δ^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $Δ^{k}$, which we term $Γ^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure."}

Conversely, if the target rank is unknown, any upper bound on the rank can be used by our algorithm, and the rank of the resulting posterior mean estimator is further reduced by the use of a low-rank promoting prior density. This prior density is a complex extension of the one proposed in (Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare Probability and Statistics, 56(2):1465-1483, 2020).

This leads to the notion of a derived functor between $\\infty$-categories of models of Malcev theories, and we study the behavior of these derived functors with respect to connectivity and limits.\n  We recall the notion of a loop theory and study in detail the interaction between functors and derived functors of $\\infty$-categories of loop models and models, establishing that a large class of comonads on the $\\infty$-category of loop models deform canonically to the $\\infty$-category of all models.\n  In the last part of the paper, we show that by considering the coalgebras for these deformed comonads over $\\infty$-categories of models, one can recover various stable deformations considered in the literature, such as filtered models or Postnikov-complete synthetic spectra. We then expand on these results by constructing $\\infty$-categories of synthetic spaces and synthetic $\\mathbf{E}_k$-rings."}

The former aims to identify stationary phases by detecting abrupt changes in the dynamics of a time series model, while the latter employs (locally) time-varying models to describe smooth changes in dependence structure of a time series. However, in some applications, abrupt and smooth changes can co-exist, and neither of the two approaches alone can model the data adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel likelihood-based procedure for the inference of multiple change-points in locally stationary time series. In contrast to traditional change-point analysis where an abrupt change occurs in a real-valued parameter, a change in locally stationary time series occurs in a parameter curve, and can be classified as a jump or a kink depending on whether the curve is discontinuous or not. We show that the proposed method can consistently estimate the number, locations, and the types of change-points. Two different asymptotic distributions corresponding respectively to jump and kink estimators are also established.Extensive simulation studies and a real data application to financial time series are provided."}

Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the \"two-hit vascular hypothesis\" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak."}

We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.\n  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix.

Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems."}

Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations."}

It is therefore not possible to use a line-search method based on the value of the objective function; instead, the line search can operate on merit functions. In this report, we explore an alternative line-search method which is applicable to this case; it particulary addresses the damping of the step length in tight valleys. We propose a line-search criterion based on the divergence of the field of Newton step vectors. The visualization of the criterion for two-dimensional test functions reveals a network of ravines with flat bottom at the zero points of the criterion. The ravines are typically connected to stationary points. To traverse this ravine network in order to approach a stationary point, a zigzag strategy is devised. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel line-search strategy succeeds from most starting points in all test functions, but only exhibits the desired damping of the step length in some situations. At the present stage it is therefore difficult to appraise the utility of this contribution."}

In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \\[ \\min_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\max_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU), \\] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ and $σ$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ with the increasing spectrum of $σ$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, Rényi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences."}

Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC."}

Building on recent work showing that the resulting Kantorovich distance can be expressed as a minimization problem over the set of spanning trees of this underlying graph, we investigate the implications of this reformulation on the construction of an optimal transport plan and a dual potential based on the solution of such an optimization problem. In this setting, we derive an explicit formula for the Kantorovich potential in terms of the imbalanced cumulative mass (a generalization of the cumulative distribution in R) along an optimal spanning tree solving such a minimization problem, under a weak non-degeneracy condition on the pair of measures that guarantees the uniqueness of a dual potential. Our second contribution establishes the existence of an optimal transport plan that can be computed efficiently by a dynamic programming procedure once an optimal spanning tree is known. Finally, we propose a stochastic algorithm based on simulated annealing on the space of spanning trees to compute such an optimal spanning tree.

Traditionally, they have been solved using algorithms that determine the expected utility-maximizing decision strategy. In contrast, state-of-the-art solution approaches convert influence diagrams into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved with powerful off-the-shelf MILP solvers. From a computational standpoint, the existing MILP formulations can be efficiently solved when applied to influence diagrams that represent periodic (or sequential) decision processes, which can be cast as partially observable Markov Decision Processes. However, they are inefficient in problems that lack a periodic structure or if the nodes in the influence diagram have large state spaces, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we present an efficient MILP formulation that is specifically designed for influence diagrams that are challenging for the earlier MILP formulation-based methods. Additionally, we present how the proposed formulation can be adapted to maximize conditional value-at-risk and how chance and logical constraints can be incorporated into the formulation, thus retaining the modeling flexibility of the MILP-based methods. Finally, we perform computational experiments addressing problems from the literature and compare the computational efficiency of the proposed formulation against the available MILP formulations for the reported influence diagrams. We find that the MILP models based on the proposed formulations can be solved significantly more efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art when solving influence diagrams that cannot be cast as partially observable Markov decision processes."}

The RST was introduced in 2007 by Baccelli and Bordenave, who investigated straightness, a deterministic property introduced by Howard and Newman in 2001, to derive information about the asymptotic directions of infinite branches. They proved that the RST is almost surely straight in dimension $2$, which directly implies that all infinite branches are asymptotically directed, every possibility is attained, and directions reached by multiple infinite branches form a dense subset. However, their approach relies crucially on planarity, preventing any straightforward extension to higher dimensions. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the RST is almost surely \\emph{straight} in any dimension, thereby obtaining the same consequences for the behavior of infinite branches. Our approach resolves the key barriers in the study of the RST, notably those posed by the complex dependency structure combined with the radial nature of the model, and especially beyond the planar setting. It relies on tools developed for the analysis of the Directed Spanning Forest, a closely related model, including recent progress by the author in 2025.

We formulate a statistical version of the conformal bootstrap that systematizes the universal statistical properties of high-energy CFT$_2$ data. We identify a series of surgery moves on bulk manifolds that precisely reflect the requirements of typicality and crossing symmetry of the boundary ensemble. These surgery moves generate a large number of bulk manifolds that have to be included in any reasonable definition of the gravitational path integral. We show that this procedure generates only on-shell (hyperbolic) manifolds, although it does not produce all of them. These proofs rely on structure theorems of 3-manifolds, which non-trivially interact with the requirements of the statistical boundary ensemble. We illustrate the application of this procedure with many examples, such as Euclidean wormholes, twisted $I$-bundles and handlebody-knots. Our findings reveal a large space of possible choices of which manifolds can be included in the gravitational path integral, reflecting a wide range of possible statistical ensembles consistent with crossing symmetry and typicality."}

By construction, it forms almost surely a tree rooted at $0$. The RST was introduced in 2007 by Baccelli and Bordenave, who investigated straightness, a deterministic property introduced by Howard and Newman in 2001, to derive information about the asymptotic directions of infinite branches. They proved that the RST is almost surely straight in dimension $2$, which directly implies that all infinite branches are asymptotically directed, every possibility is attained, and directions reached by multiple infinite branches form a dense subset. However, their approach relies crucially on planarity, preventing any straightforward extension to higher dimensions. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the RST is almost surely \\emph{straight} in any dimension, thereby obtaining the same consequences for the behavior of infinite branches. Our approach resolves the key barriers in the study of the RST, notably those posed by the complex dependency structure combined with the radial nature of the model, and especially beyond the planar setting. It relies on tools developed for the analysis of the Directed Spanning Forest, a closely related model, including recent progress by the author in 2025. Specifically, a key contribution of this work is the construction of a suitable renewal-type decomposition of RST paths. Leveraging this decomposition together with classical concentration inequalities, we show that RST paths cannot deviate far from straight lines and derive straightness."}

Our assumption is closely related to the notion of separate exchangeability studied in earlier work, but can be more realistic in many economic settings as it imposes minimal restrictions on the covariate distribution. We construct permutation tests of significance that are valid in finite samples and establish theoretical power guarantees, in contrast to existing methods that are justified only asymptotically.

While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require.\n  This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative.

Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients.

In mathematical TMTMPs, people care about whether a solution exists for a given sequence of multidimensional trigonometric moments. The solution can have the form of an atomic measure. However, for the TMTMPs in system and signal processing, a solution as an analytic rational function, of which the numerator and the denominator are positive polynomials, is desired for the ARMA modelling of a stochastic process, which is the so-called Multidimensional Rational Covariance Extension problem (RCEP) . In the literature, the feasible domain of the TMTMPs, where the spectral density is positive, is difficult to obtain given a specific choice of basis functions, which causes severe problems in the Multidimensional RCEP. In this paper, we propose a choice of basis functions, and a corresponding estimation scheme by convex optimization, for the TMTMPs, with which the trigonometric moments of the spectral estimate are exactly the sample moments. We propose an explicit condition for the convex optimization problem for guaranteeing the positiveness of the spectral estimation. The map from the parameters of the estimate to the trigonometric moments is proved to be a diffeomorphism, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of solution. The statistical properties of the proposed spectral density estimation scheme are comprehensively proved, including the consistency, (asymptotical) unbiasedness, convergence rate and efficiency under a mild assumption. This well-posed treatment is then applied to a system identification task, and the simulation results validate our proposed treatment for the TMTMP in system and signal processing."}

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases.

This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy.

In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks."}

The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme.

This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner\" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations."}

A central theme is the synergy between the theory of universal sampling discretization and Lebesgue-type inequalities for greedy algorithms. We discuss three primary algorithmic frameworks: weighted least squares and $\\ell_p$ minimization, sparse approximation methods, and greedy algorithms such as the Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (WOMP) in Hilbert spaces and the Weak Tchebychev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in Banach spaces. These methods are applied to function classes defined by structural conditions, like the $A_β^r$ and Wiener-type classes, as well as classical Sobolev-type classes with dominated mixed derivatives. Notably, we highlight recent findings showing that nonlinear sampling recovery can provide superior error guarantees compared to linear methods for certain multivariate function classes."}

In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins.\n  Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs.\n  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number."}

In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength.

In real-world applications, particularly in the energy sector, decision variables can be expressed as physical quantities (e.g., production volumes), and nonlinear performance metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) may be requested. These modeling choices introduce challenges, including the non-additivity of the objective function. This often results in highly concentrated optimized portfolios and thus limited diversification, which can be problematic for decision-makers seeking balanced investment strategies. This paper proposes two strategies to enhance diversification in ROI-based PO models, both based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The first incorporates an HHI term directly into the objective function, with its corresponding weight allowing control over diversification. The second directly maximizes diversification while controlling expected profit and risk degradation around the optimum portfolio (obtained through conventional PO). Both strategies are evaluated using synthetic data (energy assets) to illustrate their behavior and practical trade-offs.

We propose a novel DFRO method based on finite-difference gradient approximations that relies on an adaptive selection of the finite-difference accuracy and stepsize that is novel even in the Euclidean setting. When endowed with an intrinsic finite-difference scheme, that measures variations of the objective in tangent directions using retractions, our proposed method requires $O(dε^{-2})$ function evaluations and retractions to find an $ε$-critical point, where $d$ is the manifold dimension.

Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning."}

We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.\n  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions.

However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets."}

While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines."}

This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue."}

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments."}

It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.\n  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \\leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \\%$."}

Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search."}

This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product.

The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text.

A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them."}

These are systems whose components can be either working or failed; the system can also be working or failed depending on the state of the components; and repairing a component cannot cause the system to fail. We consider that one or more components can fail simultaneously, allowing us to model external shocks and disasters. For this, we use the Lévy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) multivariate distribution to model the failure times of the components. We aim to answer in which states of the system we should repair the components. This is a challenging question, as the number of repair policies grows super-exponentially in the number of components. To tackle this, we propose a simple family of repair policies, which we call $r$-out-of-$n$:R repair policies, where one repairs all failed components when the system fails or when there are $r$ or more failed components. Our main contribution is that we derive exact and simple expressions for key performance-evaluation quantities of the system operating under our proposed repair policies. That is, we give explicit expressions for the mean time-to-failure of the system, mean time-to-repair, probability of system-failure before repair, and component- and system-repair rate. We also give expressions for the expected cost and long-term average cost, when there are components' and system repair cost. The only relevant parameters involved in the derived expressions are the structural signature of the system, and the Laplace exponent associated to the LFMO distribution."}
