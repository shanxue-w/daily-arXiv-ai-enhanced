ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a\ntarget of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional\nURLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the\nrate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by\nevaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of\nthe URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our\nnumerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly\noutperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes.

A\nnonlinear lubrication equation governing the fluid dynamics and appropriate\nfunctional settings for this model are presented. It is also shown that this\nsystem satisfies a global energy-dissipation law for a suitable energy\nfunctional. Optimality conditions are derived for the solution of the\nminimisation problem of a specified cost function across a time horizon. These\nconditions are formulated at a continuous level as a system of coupled,\nforward-backward PDEs, which are subsequently discretised for numerical\ninvestigation. To ensure computational efficiency and stability, first-order\nImplicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping schemes are employed to handle the\nnonlinearities in the model, and a reduced gradient descent algorithm is\napplied to obtain a numerical approximation of the optimal control signal.\nNumerical results illustrate that controlling the thin film, even during\nrupture, achieves a precise film profile.

These notes\naim to analyze such notion from the perspective offered by the groupoid\ndescription of quantum mechanics inspired by Schwinger's picture of quantum\nmechanics. Then, a natural interpretation of the notion of physical fields as\nfunctors among appropriate groupoids will emerge. The domain of a field in this\nnew picture is a groupoid that describes ``test particles'', and its codomain\nis a groupoid that describes the intrinsic nature of the system being probed.\nSuch a space of functors carries some natural structures, which are best\ndescribed in a categorical language. Some illustrative examples will be\npresented that could help clarify the various abstract notions discussed in the\ntext."}

In\nthis work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum\nerrors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results\nover the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding\nrate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical\nerror rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical\nqubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound.

The key challenge is the\npresence of a singular matrix which makes the numerical integration hard and\nheavy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on\nsemi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs. More precisely we\nsplit the drift term as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term. The\nlinear part is approximated implicitly, while the nonlinear part is\napproximated explicitly. The linear component's role is to handle the\nsingularity issues during the numerical integration without the resolution of\nnonlinear algebraic equations in the constraint equations. This novel scheme is\ntherefore very efficient for SDAEs in high dimension that come after the\nspatial discretisation of stochastic partial differential algebraic equations\n(SPDAEs). To prove the pathwise convergence of our novel scheme, we first\nderive a equivalent scheme called dual scheme, suitable for mathematical\nanalysis and linked to the inherent stochastic differential equation resulting\nfrom the elimination of constraints in the initial SDAEs. We prove that our\nnovel scheme converges to the exact solution with rate $\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon$,\nfor arbitrary $\\epsilon>0$ in the pathwise sense.

In such a\nhyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear\ndescription of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions.

In this work, we start by\nanalysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in\nquantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the\nrandomised composite LCU.

This paper focuses on developing and\nusing domain-aware Koopman formulations for systems with hierarchical control,\nsystems with time scale separation, and systems with both. We show how those\nformulations can be leveraged to quantify the impact of cross-scale\ninteractions on overall stability and to calculate optimal control policies at\nboth fast and slow time scales."}

Computational applications typically use a\nfinite-dimensional approximation to the KO. The KO can also be applied to\ncontrolled dynamical systems, and the linearity of the KO then facilitates\nanalysis and control calculations. In principle, the potential benefits\nprovided by the KO, and the way that it facilitates the use of game theory via\nits linearity, would suggest it as a powerful approach for dealing with\nmulti-agent control problems. In practice, though, there has not been much work\nin this space: most multi-agent KO work has treated those agents as different\ncomponents of a single system rather than as distinct decision-making entities.\nThis paper develops a KO formulation for multi-agent systems that structures\nthe interactions between decision-making agents and extends this formulation to\nsystems in which the agents have hierarchical control structures and time scale\nseparated dynamics. We solve the multi-agent control problem in both cases as\nboth a centralized optimization and as a general-sum game theory problem. The\ncomparison of the two sets of optimality conditions defining the control\nsolutions illustrates how coupling between agents can create differences\nbetween the social optimum and the Nash equilibrium."}
