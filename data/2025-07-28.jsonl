Shift-equivariant systems typically admit\ntraveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the\nsolution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a\nrelatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator\ninference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data,\nwithout knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms\nto ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially\nfrozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a\nfunction of that profile. We validate our approach using the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation\nthat exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos.

To increase the\naccuracy, we modify the FDM to reduce the pollution effect. The linear system\nof the FDM generates an M-matrix, provided the mesh size $h$ is sufficiently\nsmall. For the time dependent nonlinear equation, we discrete the temporal\ndomain using the Crank-Nicolson (CN), BDF3, BDF4 time stepping methods, and\napply a similar iterative method to rewrite the nonlinear equation as the same\nlinear convection-diffusion equation. Then we propose the second-order to\nfourth-order compact 9-point FDMs with the reduced pollution effects on a\nuniform Cartesian grid.

The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence. Optimal-order error\nestimates are rigorously derived for the WG finite element solutions.\nAdditionally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to validate the\ntheoretical findings, illustrating the method's robustness, reliability,\nflexibility, and accuracy in solving the Brinkman equations."}

In contrast to the commonly-used phase-field approach,\nthis proposed approach for investigating fracture paths does not require a\nspecified `length-scale' parameter defining the diffuse interface region nor a\nlevel set function. Instead, it interprets the fracture as part of the boundary\nof the domain and uses shape optimization algorithms to minimize the energy in\nthe system and therefore describes the fracture propagation directly. Embedding\nthe problem of energy minimization in a Riemannian manifold framework\nformulated on a suitable shape space, together with the choice of an outer\nRiemannian metric, yields both advantages from an analytical as well as an\napplied perspective. Furthermore, an eigenvalue decomposition of the strain\ntensor is used to produce more realistic fracture paths (the so-called strain\nsplitting), which only allows fracture growth from tensile loads. Numerical\nsimulations for the commonly considered single-edge notch tension and shear\ntest are performed and the results are evaluated in comparison to phase-field\nresults."}

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for\nfixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

The method is based on the lower and upper bounds on maximum probability\n$\\max_x P(X=x)$, and the objective of the paper is to exploit the joint Markov\nproperty of $(X,Y)$ to calculate possibly good bounds in possibly cheap way.\n  This research is motivated by decoding or segmentation problem in triplet\nMarkov models. A triplet Markov model is trivariate homogeneous Markov process\n$(X,U,Y)$. In decoding, a realization of one marginal process $Y$ is observed\n(representing the data), while $X$ and $U$ are latent processes. The process\n$U$ serves as a nuisance variable, whereas $X$ is the process of primary\ninterest. Decoding refers to estimating the hidden sequence $X$ based solely on\nthe observation $Y$. Conditional on $Y$, the latent processes $(X, U)$ form a\nnon-homogeneous Markov chain. In this context, the Viterbi path corresponds to\nthe maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of $X$, making it a natural choice for\nsignal reconstruction."}

In particular, letting\n$\\hat{\\lambda}_l^\\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\\Delta_n$, and\nunder suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of\ndecay of $\\varepsilon$, we prove that $\\sqrt{n } (\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon\n- \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with\na variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to\ninterpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a\nsuitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric\ninterpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the\nasymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of\nthe eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter\ninterpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple\neigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of\nour results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical\nanalysis are relaxed."}
