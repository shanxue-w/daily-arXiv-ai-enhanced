Existing methods for operator\ninference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data,\nwithout knowledge of the full-order dynamics.

For the time dependent nonlinear equation, we discrete the temporal\ndomain using the Crank-Nicolson (CN), BDF3, BDF4 time stepping methods, and\napply a similar iterative method to rewrite the nonlinear equation as the same\nlinear convection-diffusion equation.

The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence. Optimal-order error\nestimates are rigorously derived for the WG finite element solutions.\nAdditionally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to validate the\ntheoretical findings, illustrating the method's robustness, reliability,\nflexibility, and accuracy in solving the Brinkman equations."}

Embedding\nthe problem of energy minimization in a Riemannian manifold framework\nformulated on a suitable shape space, together with the choice of an outer\nRiemannian metric, yields both advantages from an analytical as well as an\napplied perspective. Furthermore, an eigenvalue decomposition of the strain\ntensor is used to produce more realistic fracture paths (the so-called strain\nsplitting), which only allows fracture growth from tensile loads. Numerical\nsimulations for the commonly considered single-edge notch tension and shear\ntest are performed and the results are evaluated in comparison to phase-field\nresults."}

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived.

This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall.

In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure\nof length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in\neach coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied\nalmost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical\ncalculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating\ncomputational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for\nthe one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping,\nwhere the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure\nprecisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function."}

This makes\nsuch an attack one of the most feasible approaches to carrying out collusion.\nIn order to trace all the colluders, several types of multimedia fingerprinting\ncodes were introduced to construct fingerprints resistant to averaging attacks\non multimedia contents, such as AND anti-collusion codes (AND-ACCs), binary\nseparable codes (SCs), logical anti-collusion codes (LACCs), binary frameproof\ncodes (FPCs), binary strongly-separable codes (SSCs) and binary secure code\nwith list decoding (SCLDs).

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific\ncomputing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and\ninversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order\noptimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work\nfocuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning\nspecific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.\n  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to\nunderstand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix\nfamilies. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to\n$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\\mathcal{F}$. Standard results\nfrom matrix sketching show that $O(\\log|\\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice\nin this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for\nvector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have\nbeen widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.\n  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a\nnearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log|\\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is\ntight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends\nto well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a\nnear-optimal approximation from any \\emph{linear matrix family} of dimension\n$q$ can be learned with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an\n$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector\nqueries."}

We analyze their singularities, defined as the\ninitial configurations for which the minimizer of the associated variational\nproblem is not unique. Moreover, we estimate the size of the closure of the\nsingular set by proving its $\\mathcal{H}^{d(N-1)-1}$-rectifiability, and we\nprovide an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of regular\nconjugate points."}

Employing an integral\nequation approach, we rigorously prove the existence of these solutions and\nestablish several fundamental properties, including upper and lower estimates,\nmass conservation, regularity, and monotonicity. To bridge theory and practice,\nwe introduce a family of convergent numerical schemes specifically designed to\ncompute the Barenblatt solutions, ensuring reliable and efficient\napproximations. The theoretical framework is enriched with various examples\nthat illustrate the concepts and validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nnumerical methods, enhancing the understanding and applicability of our\nresults."}
