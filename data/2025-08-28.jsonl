We introduce a physics-inspired,\nmodel-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a\ncommunity-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are\nfirst extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature\nvector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph.

Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack\nsuch gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male\nversus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic\ncounterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models.

While previous research in information thermodynamics has focused\non the thermodynamic costs associated with information \"erasure'' or\n\"measurement'' through concepts such as Landauer's principle and mutual\ninformation, little systematic discussion has addressed the inherently\nirreversible nature of \"replication'' itself and the accompanying degradation\nof information structure. In this study, we construct a mathematical model of\ninformation replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution,\nand quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy,\ncross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic\ndecrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as\na potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a\nnonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we\nextend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information\nprocesses such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for\ndegradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD. This contributes to\nbuilding a unified information-thermodynamic framework for operations such as\nreplication, transmission, and repair of information."}

This is the case of space\nTeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence,\nand optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link\nTransmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction,\nthe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC\nsynchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the\nlong LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder\nalways fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding\nand detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC\ncode is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the\ndecoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail\nsequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this\npaper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some\nmethods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various\ndetection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection\nprobability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed.\nOur simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain\nthe same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based\ndetection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach\nbeing less complex than the latter."}

I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative\nepistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a\ncentralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is\ndesigned to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides\na causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent\nstudies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more\ncomplex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is\nthat the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains\nsimultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be\nrecombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity.\nHowever, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional.\nThis paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus\nrecombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with\nthe technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether\nindividuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs,\nor as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and\nrecombine them. The paper concludes by outlining the cognitive and\ninstitutional scaffolds required to resolve this tension, arguing they are the\ndecisive variable that determine whether generative AI becomes an instrument of\ninnovation or homogenization."}

Energy management\nis crucial in H4C, as these systems often integrate renewable energy sources,\ninvolve energy-intensive industries, include numerous energy consumers, and may\nrely on energy-based industrial symbiosis exchanges.\n  This study presents a modelling framework for energy management in H4C,\ndeveloped through a systematic literature review of related systems including\nenergy-based IS.

This bit budget imposes a\ntrade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy\nconsumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit\ndepth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with\nlow-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with\nSigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,\nSDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to\nhandle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)\naddresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,\nresulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and\nUSF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise\nshaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited\nsignals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.\n(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery\nmethod for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques,\noffering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive\nnumerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a\nbroader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems."}

This process is\ncomputationally expensive and ad hoc. In this work, we take a principled\napproach to study this issue for robust optimization problems with linear\nobjective functions, convex feasible regions, and convex uncertainty sets. We\nintroduce and study what we define as the robust path: a set of robust\nsolutions obtained by varying the uncertainty set's parameters. Our central\ngeometric insight is that a robust path can be characterized as a Bregman\nprojection of a curve (whose geometry is defined by the uncertainty set) onto\nthe feasible region. This leads to a surprising discovery that the robust path\ncan be approximated via the trajectories of standard optimization algorithms,\nsuch as the proximal point method, of the deterministic counterpart problem.
