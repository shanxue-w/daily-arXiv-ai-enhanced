To address these, we propose a\nhybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with\nsurface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of\nMaxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar\npotentials ($\\mathbf{A}$-$\\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural\ncompatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to\nlow-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded\nregions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is\ndiscretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological\ninvariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured\nmeshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently\nsatisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain\ntruncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the\nSIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to\ntwo by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the\nvector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a\ncorresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is\nrepresented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form\nrepresentation. This novel treatment improves compatibility at the interface\nand significantly enhances numerical performance. The proposed hybrid method\nthus offers a unified, efficient, and physically consistent framework for\nsolving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in complex geometries\nand heterogeneous materials"}

However, according\nto current research, there is limited research on channel detection and\nmodeling in forest areas in the existing literature. This paper describes the\nchannel measurements campaign of air and ground in the Arxan National Forest\nPark of Inner Mongolia. It presents measurement results and propagation models\nfor ground-to-ground (G2G) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios. The measurement\ncampaign uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals centered at\n1.4 GHz for channel sounding. In the G2G measurement, in addition to using\nomnidirectional antennas to record data, we also use directional antennas to\nrecord the arrival angle information of the signal at the receiver. In the A2G\nmeasurement, we pre-plan the flight trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle\nso that it can fly at a fixed angle relative to the ground. We present path\nloss models suitable for G2G and A2G in forest environments based on the\nanalysis of measurement results. The results indicate that the proposed model\nreduces error margins compared with other path loss models. Furthermore, we\nderive the multipath model expression specific to forest environments and\nconduct statistical analysis on key channel parameters e.g., shadow fading\nfactor, root mean square delay spread, and Rician K factor. Our findings reveal\nthat signal propagation obstruction due to tree crowns in A2G communication is\nmore pronounced than tree trunk obstructions in G2G communication. Adjusting\nthe elevation angle between air and ground can enhance communication quality."}

Virtual coupling is an emerging railroad technology that\nreduces the distance between trains to increase the capacity of the line,\nwhereas LMPC is an optimization-based controller that incorporates artificial\nintelligence methods to improve its control policies. By incorporating data\nfrom past experiences into the optimization problem, LMPC can learn unmodeled\ndynamics and enhance system performance while satisfying constraints. The LMPC\ndeveloped in this paper is simulated and compared, in terms of energy\nconsumption, with a general MPC, without learning capabilities.

The incompressible limit of the weak solutions holds even without\nrequiring the initial velocity to be divergence-free.

Traditional model-based control relies on precise system\nmodels, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability\nguarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper\nproposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven\nmodeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended\nDynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional\nKoopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data.\nSubsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller\nis synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the\nstructural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model\nerrors and circumvent the \"explosion of complexity\" issue inherent in\ntraditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through\nsimulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that\nthe controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small\nneighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the\ninitial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals.\nThis research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches\nwith the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance\ncontrol strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time\nfor nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex\ndynamics."}
