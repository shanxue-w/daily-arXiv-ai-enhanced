The extension is achieved by introducing transfer grids between the planar subdomain and interface grids, together with stable discrete projection operators for primal (potential) and dual (flux) variables. The proposed non-matching estimators remain fully guaranteed and computable. Numerical experiments, including three-dimensional problems based on community benchmarks for incompressible Darcy flow in fractured porous media, demonstrate reliable performance of the estimators for the non-matching grids and effectivity that is comparable to the estimators for matching grids."}

Indeed, most fundamental physics laws are expressed as relationships between derivatives in space and time. However, derivatives are rarely directly measurable and must instead be computed, often from noisy, potentially corrupt data streams. There is a rich and broad literature of computational differentiation algorithms, but many impose extra constraints to work correctly, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, or are compromised in the presence of noise and corruption. It can therefore be challenging to select the method best-suited to any particular problem. Here, we review a broad range of numerical methods for calculating derivatives, present important contextual considerations and choice points, compare relative advantages, and provide basic theory for each algorithm in order to assist users with the mathematical underpinnings. This serves as a practical guide to help scientists and engineers match methods to application domains. We also provide an open-source Python package, PyNumDiff, which contains a broad suite of methods for differentiating noisy data."}

Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics."}

The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution."}

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications."}

We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable.

To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper.

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver.

The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed."}

Chartrand, ed.), John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981, pp. 557-576].\n  Although the Esperet's conjecture is false in general, in this study we consider an analogue of Esperet's conjecture as follows: Let $C$ be a hereditary class of graphs, and $d \\ge 1$. Suppose that there is a function $f$ such that $χ(G) \\le f(τ_d(G))$ for each $G \\in C$. Can we always choose $f$ to be a polynomial?

This paper offers an approach for a more reactive (i.e., feedback-based) guidance that is based on closed-form analytical expressions and thereby suitable for onboard, real-time execution. In addition, a risk measurement is formulated based upon the concept of Dynamic Maneuvering Cue (DMC) which measures the amount of turn a vehicle would need to take in its current state in order to put itself outside the threat region. This approach is then extended to handle multiple threat regions simultaneously (with minimal additional computational complexity). Finally, the DMC constraint is applied to a simple feedback controller as well as a model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC shows better performance but at the cost of having to solve an optimization problem online versus the meager computational burden associated with the simple controller. This approach, which is based on assuming the threats are adversarial, may be used as a conservative method for collision avoidance and deconfliction."}

The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertnyĭ realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true.

We further theoretically analyze the approximation error of the proposed compressed representation. We numerically demonstrate that the learned operator allows efficient prediction of future events and solving high-dimensional boundary value problems. This gives rise to a simple linear algebraic method for high-dimensional rare-events simulations."}

Using a novel min-max argument that combines monotonicity trick, Morse index estimates, and blow-up analysis, we prove the existence of a positive mountain pass solution for sufficiently small mass, revealing a new phenomenon of non-autonomous nonlinearities in non-compact domains."}

In extremum-seeking systems, exploration and exploitation are inherently coupled. This coupling necessitates careful consideration in the design of the event-triggered controller. To address this challenge, we incorporate a low-pass filter into the algorithm and carefully design the flow and jump sets of the resulting hybrid system.

The framework is then extended to Filippov systems with discontinuous dynamics and to hybrid dynamical systems with state-dependent switching, yielding new necessary conditions for optimality in these settings.

Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate.\n  These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields.

Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present.

Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications."}

This study proposes an innovative higher-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method, aimed at accurately and efficiently computing the transient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling problems of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales. In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments. It can be summarized that this scalable and robust HOTS computational approach offers a reliably numerical tool for nonlinear multiphysics simulation of large-scale heterogeneous structures in real-world applications."}

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."}

In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path.

We discuss the roles of the real and imaginary step parameters, compare FFT-based and interpolation-based implementations, and demonstrate the method on the advection equation and instantaneous-frequency computation.

However, the openness of UAV-based communications leads to security and privacy concerns in wireless transmissions. This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation. Considering this is a complicated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm-based optimization solution.

Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians."}

As is observed in various planar models of random geometry as part of the phenomenon of geodesic confluence, geodesics in $γ$-LQG tend to merge with each other. In particular, in Gwynne-Miller '19, it was established that in $γ$-LQG, geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce in the sense that any two such geodesics almost surely merge before reaching their common target. However, in view of the randomness inherent to the geometry, it is a priori possible that while geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce, there exists a sequence of geodesics $P_n$ converging to an exceptional geodesic $P$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $P_n$ does not overlap with $P$ for any $n$. In this paper, we prove that this is not possible, thereby establishing a strong confluence statement for $γ$-LQG for all $γ\\in (0,2)$.

The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{iβ} = e^{iβ\\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|β|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical.\n  The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{iβ}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $β$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian. The analysis positions the framework as a compact and testable phenomenological representation of logarithmic spectral corrections appearing in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories."}

However, for unbalanced crossed designs, $\\mathbf{V}$ is dense and the lack of a closed-form representation for $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, until now, has made using likelihood-based methods computationally challenging and difficult to analyse mathematically. We use the Khatri--Rao product to represent $\\mathbf{V}$ and then to construct a modified covariance matrix whose inverse admits an exact spectral decomposition. Building on this construction, we obtain an elegant and simple approximation to $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ for asymptotic unbalanced designs. For non-asymptotic settings, we derive an accurate and interpretable approximation under mildly unbalanced data and establish an exact inverse representation as a low-rank correction to this approximation, applicable to arbitrary degrees of unbalance.

We prove mean-square, strong error estimates for the proposed scheme and show that the order of convergence is $H-1/4$, where $H\\in(1/4,1)$ is the Hurst index. For the proof, we establish new regularity results for real-valued and infinite dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process depending on the value of the Hurst parameter $H$.

The fluid is thereby governed by the non necessarily isentropic compressible Euler equations, while the rigid body obeys the conservation of linear and angular momentum. This forms a coupled system comprising an ODE and the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) of a hyperbolic system with characteristic boundary in a moving domain, where the fluid velocity matches the solid velocity along the normal direction of the solid boundary. We establish the existence of a unique local classical solution to this coupled system. To construct the solution, we first perform a change of variables to reformulate the problem in a fixed spatial domain, and then analyze an approximate system with a non-characteristic boundary. For this nonlinear approximate system, we use the better regularity for the trace of the pressure on the boundary to contruct a solution by a fixed-point argument in which the fluid motion and the solid motion are updated in successive steps. We are then able to derive estimates independent of the regularization parameter and to pass to the limit by a strong compactness arguments."}

While successive pseudospectral convexification combines spectral collocation with successive convexification, classical pseudospectral methods are not geometry-consistent on manifolds.

We introduce a geometry-consistent transcription that enables pseudospectral collocation without imposing manifold constraints extrinsically.

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning."}

The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed."}

However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails.

Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions.

In this work, we propose a \\emph{relaxed randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz} (rRABEBK) method for solving a broad class of combined optimization problems. The proposed method integrates an averaging block strategy with two relaxation parameters to accelerate convergence and enhance numerical stability. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that rRABEBK achieves linear convergence in expectation, with explicit constants that quantify the effect of the relaxation mechanism, and a provably faster rate than the classical randomized extended Bregman-Kaczmarz method. Our method can be readily adapted to sparse least-squares problems and extended to both consistent and inconsistent systems without modification. Complementary numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that rRABEBK significantly outperforms the existing Kaczmarz-type algorithms in terms of both iteration complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting both its practical and theoretical advantages."}

In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity $m(G_σ, λ)$ of any real eigenvalue $λ$ of a connected signed graph $G_σ$ in terms of its girth. Our main result shows that \\[ m(G_σ, λ) \\le n - g(G_σ) + 2, \\] where $n$ is the number of vertices and $g(G_σ)$ is the girth.

It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations."}

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself.

The main insight is that nonsmooth algorithms, such as proximal subgradient, proximal point, and their stochastic variants, implicitly minimize a smooth surrogate function induced by the Moreau envelope. Meanwhile, explicit smoothing, which directly minimizes a smooth approximation of the objective, has long been recognized as an efficient strategy for nonsmooth optimization. In this paper, we generalize the notion of smoothable functions, which was proposed by Beck and Teboulle (2012) for nonsmooth convex optimization. This generalization provides a unified viewpoint on several important smoothing techniques for weakly convex optimization, including Nesterov-type smoothing and Moreau envelope smoothing. Our theory yields a framework for designing smooth approximation algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic weakly convex problems with provable complexity guarantees. Furthermore, our theory extends to the smooth approximation of non-Lipschitz functions, allowing for complexity analysis even when global Lipschitz continuity does not hold."}

Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity."}

In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples."}

The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertnyĭ realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism."}

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."}

While they have shown considerable empirical success, significant challenges remain -- particularly regarding training stability and the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees, especially when compared to classical mesh-based methods. In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples."}

With the exception of configurations where one input is located at an endpoint, cases already well studied in the literature, all admissible two-inputs configurations are treated in this paper within a unified framework. The proposed approach relies on a backstepping transformation combined with a reformulation of the closed-loop dynamics as an Integral Difference Equation (IDE). This IDE representation reveals a common structural pattern across configurations and clarifies the role played by delayed dynamics in the stability analysis. Within this formulation, the stabilization problem can be handled using existing IDE control techniques. For most configurations, the stabilization of the PDE system requires an approximate spectral controllability assumption. Remarkably, one specific configuration can be stabilized without imposing any additional spectral condition.

Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications."}

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution.

Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers.

We remove the two structural assumptions typically required by other approaches, namely that the polynomial attains its infimum and zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal. Our approach combines a denominator-free stereographic transformation with a refined variant of the Hanzon--Jibetean perturbation scheme. The stereographic transformation preserves nonnegativity while making the polynomial coercive, with explicit bounds on the radius of positivity and on the nonzero critical values. Subsequently, we apply carefully constructed explicit perturbations that enforce zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal without altering nonnegativity, allowing us to invoke recent algorithms to derive algebraic certificates or rational witness points. We present three algorithms implementing our framework and analyze their bit complexity in detail, which is single exponential with respect to the number of variables. A second contribution is a new explicit SOS perturbation scheme, which allows us to perturb any nonnegative polynomial in such a way that it can be written as a sum of squares (SOS). In contrast to Lasserre's classical SOS approximation, which guaranties density but currently does not provide an effective control over the perturbation size, we only derive concrete perturbation bounds ensuring that a nonnegative polynomial enters the SOS cone."}
