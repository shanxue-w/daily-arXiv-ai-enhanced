Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying\nthe failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant\nerror-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical\nfailure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access\ncircuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more\ndifficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components\n(gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the\ncircuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6}\nregime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work\nby Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model.

When\nthe population covariance matrix follows an inverse Wishart distribution, we\napproximate the expected holdout error, first with a linear shrinkage, then\nwith a quadratic shrinkage to approximate the oracle eigenvalues.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted\nfrom concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum\nchaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the\nspace of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly\nexponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer\nnotion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator\ngrowth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any\nphysical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two\nobservables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator\n$A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of\nall higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result\nprovides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point\nOTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to\nfreeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of\nrecent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify\nuniversal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of\nchaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains,\nwhich indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a\ngeneric feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic\nbehavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary\ndesigns, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space\nbut remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic\nof chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC."}

This is done by justifying de Bruijn's\nidentity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a\nre-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that\nthere exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$\nsuch that $h(X+Y) = \\infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite\nentropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for\nany independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the\ncontinuity of $t \\mapsto h(X+\\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \\sim\n\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then\nestablish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's\nEPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a\nquantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under\nlog-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a\ncompactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality\nand leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions."}

We introduce a unifying variational\nframework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations\nof the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective\nfunctionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error,\nwhile linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this\nperspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling\ndistributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking\ndiscretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach\nyields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes\nacross norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of\nthe loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the\ngradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning,\nwe demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and\narchitectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of\nresidual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled\ndiscretization and training strategies."}

Within this\nperspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling\ndistributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking\ndiscretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach\nyields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes\nacross norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of\nthe loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the\ngradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning,\nwe demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and\narchitectures.

This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing\nequations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from\nsmooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily\nidentified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for\nkey open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases,\nwhere unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we\npresent the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable\nsingularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the\ninitial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are\nexceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite\nprecision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations\nimmediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we\npresent multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible\nporous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a\nsimple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of\ninstability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and\ntraining schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving\naccuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered\nsolutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine\nprecision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off\nerrors of the GPU hardware.

We prove a quantitative mean-field limit in terms of Wasserstein\ndistances under certain conditions on the initial configuration while\nmaintaining control of the particle configuration in the form of the minimal\ndistance and certain singular sums of the particle distances. As a corollary,\nwe show propagation of chaos for $\\alpha<\\frac{d-1}{2}$ for $d\\ge 3$ and\n$\\alpha<\\frac 13=\\frac{2d-3}{3}$ for $d=2$. This extends the results of Hauray\n(https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218202509003814), which yield propagation of chaos\nfor $\\alpha < \\frac{d-2}{2}$ without an assumption on the sign of the\ninteraction. The main novel ingredient is that due to the non-attraction\nproperty it is enough to control the distance to the next-to-nearest neighbour\nparticle."}
