Unlike traditional\ncontact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between\ntwo contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact\nconstraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different\napplications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a\ngeneralization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)\ncan handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for\nmodeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the\nprojection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the\nrank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third\nmedium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which\nfurther complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the\nstabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to\nsolve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM,\nSFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the\nconstruction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon\nthe traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of\nSFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of\nhigh-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical\nexamples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of\nSFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems."}

The subgroups in question are the\nsymmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset\nof $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite\npartition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in\nsemigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover\nthat the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the\nidempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms\nand partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$.

While the existing stochastic control theory is well\nequipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm\nshift using distance measure based decision making is required for the\neffective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure\nbetween two linear time invariant stochastic dynamical systems is proposed\nhere, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear\ndynamical systems. Distance measure for stochastic systems is proposed for the\nfrequency domain setting as the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein\ndistance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse\nstereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting,\nthe proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-$q$\nWasserstein distance between the push-forward measures under both systems'\ncorresponding measurable maps from the parameter space to their respective\nspace of system plants. It is proved and demonstrated using numerical\nsimulation that the proposed frequency domain distance measure shall never\nexceed the proposed time domain distance measure counterpart.

As a\ngeneralization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)\ncan handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for\nmodeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the\nprojection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the\nrank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third\nmedium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which\nfurther complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the\nstabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to\nsolve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM,\nSFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the\nconstruction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon\nthe traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of\nSFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of\nhigh-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical\nexamples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of\nSFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems."}

Empirically, we conclude that this new class of\noptimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight\nimprovement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks.

We explore three different approaches to this\ntask. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain\nsubgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the\nsymmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset\nof $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite\npartition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in\nsemigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover\nthat the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the\nidempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms\nand partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore,\nwe show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains\na finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$\nsuch that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$\ngenerates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$\nunder a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for\nthe symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are\nsubsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \\preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a\nfinite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup\ngenerated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of\nsubsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate\na conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah."}

Their\nportfolio selection is interconnected through relative performance concerns,\ni.e., each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it\ncompares to the average terminal wealth of both investors. We model this as\nStackelberg competition: the partially-informed investor (the \"follower\")\nobserves the trading behavior of the fully-informed investor (the \"leader\") and\ndecides her trading strategy accordingly; the leader, anticipating the\nfollower's response, in turn selects a trading strategy that best suits her\nobjective. To prevent information leakage, the leader adopts a randomized\nstrategy selected under an entropy-regularized mean-variance objective, where\nthe entropy regularizer quantifies the randomness of a chosen strategy. The\nfollower, on the other hand, observes only the actual trading actions of the\nleader (sampled from the randomized strategy), but not the randomized strategy\nitself. Her mean-variance objective is thus a random field, in the form of an\nexpectation conditioned on a realized path of the leader's trading actions. In\nthe idealized case of continuous sampling of the leader's trading actions, we\nderive a Stackelberg equilibrium where the follower's trading strategy depends\nlinearly on the actual trading actions of the leader and the leader samples her\ntrading actions from Gaussian distributions.

In the aughts,\nKnutson showed that Frobenius splittings of a certain type descend through\nGr\\\"obner degeneration of a certain type, called geometric vertex\ndecomposition. In the present paper, we give a partial converse to Knutson's\nresult. We show that a Frobenius splitting that compatibly splits both link and\ndeletion of a geometric vertex decomposition can, under an additional\nhypothesis on the form of the splitting, be lifted to a splitting that\ncompatibly splits the original ideal. We discuss an example showing that the\nadditional hypothesis cannot be removed. Our argument uses the relationship\nbetween geometric vertex decomposition and Gorenstein liaison developed by\nKlein and Rajchgot. Additionally, we show that Li's double determinantal\nvarieties defined by maximal minors are Frobenius split."}

Each agent independently\nlearns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex\nsemidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and\ncorresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based\nwaypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and\ndefine safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of\nsuch waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids\noverlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All\nagents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a\nspace-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing\nsimultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree\nis equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without\nre-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not\nonly dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both\nenvironmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,\nsafe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,\nusing only data and convex optimization tools."}
