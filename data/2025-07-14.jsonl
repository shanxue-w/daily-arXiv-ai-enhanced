This problem is often addressed by\nsolving a first-kind integral equation using regularization techniques to\nstabilize an inherently unstable process. A similar approach is used in our\nwork, where the continued field is represented as the potential of a simple\nlayer or its vertical derivative. The constancy of the density sign of this\nequivalent simple layer preserves the sign of anomalies, provided that the\nlayer's surface encloses all anomalous sources. This constraint is a key\nfeature of our algorithm for the downward continuation of potential fields.

Given that any level-set function\nwith a constant level set corresponding to the surface can be used for such\nestimations, numerical methods need not specify a unique target function for\nthe domain-type interpolation problems. In this paper, we focus on kernel-based\ninterpolation by radial basis functions (RBF) and reformulate the uniquely\nsolvable interpolation problem into a constrained optimization model. This\nmodel minimizes some user-defined norm while enforcing all interpolation\nconditions. To enable nontrivial feasible solutions, we propose to enhance the\ntrial space with 1D kernel basis functions inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs). Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed mixed\ndimensional trial space significantly improves surface reconstruction from raw\npoint clouds. This is particularly evident in the precise estimation of surface\nnormals, outperforming traditional RBF trial spaces including the one for\nHermite interpolation. This framework not only enhances processing of raw point\ncloud data but also shows potential for further contributions to computational\ngeometry.

This TV-regularized convex program\non the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy\nobservation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have\nuncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in\norder to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local\npositive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In\npractice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.\nAt the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the\nmodel kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known\nLPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding\nconditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list\nof LPC-kernels, proving that the \"sinc-4\" kernel, used for signal recovery and\nmixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the\nnoise level, leading to effective near regions.

In many ways, scaled graphs can be\nseen as a generalization of the classical Nyquist plot for linear\ntime-invariant systems, and facilitate a powerful graphical tool for analyzing\nnonlinear feedback systems.

The aim of\nthe second and principal part of this thesis is to provide a far-reaching\ngeneralization of Yang-Mills theory, extending it from the classical setting of\nprincipal bundles to general Lie groupoids and algebroids. The notion of a\nprincipal bundle connection is now replaced with that of a more general\nmultiplicative Ehresmann connection. In obtaining this generalization, we make\nvarious advances to the theory of such connections, as well as invariant linear\nconnections on representations.

Since these measures are functions of the\ncovariance matrix \"S\" and its inverse \"S^-1\", the associated Wishart and\ninverse-Wishart distributions are of note. The DTC is shown here to be the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair \"(S^-1)\" and its\ndiagonal matrix \"diag(S^-1)\", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure\nof \"total partial correlation\", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where\n\"P\" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2), with\nD=diag(S^-1)). The second aim of this paper introduces a generalization of all\nthese measures for structured groups of variables. For instance, consider three\nor more groups, each consisting of three or more variables, with predominant\nredundancy within each group, but with synergistic interactions between groups.\nO-information will miss the between group synergy (since redundancy occurs more\noften in the system). In contrast, the structured O-information measure\npresented here will correctly report predominant synergy between groups. This\nis a relevant generalization towards structured multivariate information\nmeasures. A third aim is the presentation of a framework for quantifying the\ncontribution of \"connections\" between variables, to the system's TC, DTC,\nO-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to present a generalization\nof the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the contribution of a group of\nvariables to the system's redundancy-synergy balance. Finally, it is shown that\nthe expressions derived here directly apply to data from several other\nelliptical distributions. All program codes, data files, and executables are\navailable."}

Furthermore, reflecting traded VA contracts in the\nmarket, we consider hybrid products providing policyholders access to a cash\nfund which functions as an intermediate repository of earnings from the VA and\nearns interest at a contractually specified cash rate. We contribute to the\nliterature by revealing several significant interactions among taxation, the\ncash fund, and the benefit base update mechanism. When tax rates are high, the\ntax-shielding effect of the cash fund, which is taxed differently from ordinary\nwithdrawals from the VA, plays a significant role in enhancing the\nattractiveness of the overall contract. Furthermore, the ratchet benefit base\nupdate scheme (in contrast to the ubiquitous return-of-premium specification in\nthe literature) tends to discourage early surrender as it provides enhanced\ndownside market risk protection.

Critical phenomena give a natural route\nfrom smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity,\nand are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity,\nastrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general\nrelativity.

The study of the\nthree-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic\norbits (UPOs) have provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far\nback as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently\nchallenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we\npresent an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control\nof UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and\nthe local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising\nprior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables\nsample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\\'{e} map\nin as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\\'{e} map is best\ndiscovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e.\nthe local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the\nUPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving\na convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We\nconstrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system,\nresulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable\nmanifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient\nmanner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across\nseveral orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from\nrobotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics."}

The DTC is shown here to be the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair \"(S^-1)\" and its\ndiagonal matrix \"diag(S^-1)\", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure\nof \"total partial correlation\", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where\n\"P\" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2), with\nD=diag(S^-1)).

Motivated by\nthis, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance\nmetric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\\alpha$ distances:\n$d_\\alpha(\\pi,\\sigma):=\\sum_{i=1} |\\pi(i)-\\sigma(i)|^\\alpha$.\n  For any $\\alpha\\geq 1$ and $\\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time\nApproximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are\n$\\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even\nin the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that\nrequired vanishing dispersion ($\\beta\\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we\npropose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly\nestimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal\ndistance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for\nany values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically\nusing datasets from sports rankings."}
