In this case, the solutions of the NS equations exhibit certain\nsingularities at $t=0$, e.g., the $H^s$ norm of the solution blows up as\n$t\\rightarrow 0$ when $s>0$. To date, the best convergence result proved in the\nliterature are first-order accuracy in both time and space for the\nsemi-implicit Euler time-stepping scheme and divergence-free finite elements\n(even high-order finite elements are used), while numerical results demonstrate\nthat second-order convergence in time and space may be achieved. Therefore,\nthere is still a gap between numerical analysis and numerical computation for\nthe NS equations with $L^2$ initial data. The primary challenge to realizing\nhigh-order convergence is the insufficient regularity in the solutions due to\nthe rough initial condition and the nonlinearity of the equations. In this\nwork, we propose a fully discrete numerical scheme that utilizes the\nTaylor--Hood or Stokes-MINI finite element method for spatial discretization\nand an implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta time-stepping method in conjunction with\ngraded stepsizes. By employing discrete semigroup techniques, sharp regularity\nestimates, negative norm estimates and the $L^2$ projection onto the\ndivergence-free Raviart--Thomas element space, we prove that the proposed\nscheme attains second-order convergence in both space and time. Numerical\nexamples are presented to support the theoretical analysis. In particular, the\nconvergence in space is at most second order even higher-order finite elements\nare used.

Unlike classical limiters, which detects only\nsolution discontinuities to dichotomize cells into good or troubled, the\nproposed MR limiter also takes into account the derivative discontinuities to\ndivide cells into several groups. The method operates by performing a\nsuccessive comparison of the local DG polynomial's derivatives, from high-order\nto low-order, against a baseline constructed from neighboring cell averages. If\na $k$th-order derivative of the DG polynomial is larger than the baseline,\n  then we reduce the order to $k-1$ and set the corresponding $k$th-order terms\nto be 0; Otherwise, the remaining $k$th-order DG polynomial is used to\nrepresent the final solution. Only if all the derivatives are larger than the\nbaseline, a TVD slope limiter is used to reconstruct the solution. In this\nmanner, the limiter dynamically selects an optimal polynomial suited to the\nlocal solution smoothness without problem-dependent parameter to tune.

The main novelty of this paper is that the\ndomains may be unbounded, including of infinite volume.\n  First, we prove a sharp upper bound for the infimal energy among all\n$k$-partitions by a threshold value which involves the infimum $\\Sigma$ of the\nessential spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the whole domain as well as\nthe infimal energy among all $k-1$-partitions.

Both methods\ndeem a variable important if predictions with the original data substantially\noutperform those with permutations. In linear regression, empirical studies\nhave linked PaP to regression coefficients and LOCO to $t$-statistics, but a\nformal theory has been lacking. We derive closed-form expressions for both\nmeasures, expressed using square-root transformations. PaP is shown to be\nproportional to the coefficient and predictor variability: $\\text{PaP}_i =\n\\beta_i \\sqrt{2\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbf{x}^v_i)}$, while LOCO is proportional\nto the coefficient but dampened by collinearity (captured by $\\Delta$):\n$\\text{LOCO}_i = \\beta_i (1 -\\Delta)\\sqrt{1 + c}$.

While the EnKU\nis exact for Gaussian joints $\\pi$ in the mean-field limit, exactness alone\ndoes not fix the update: infinitely many affine maps $L_{y_\\ast}$ push a\nGaussian $\\pi$ to $\\pi_{X|Y=y_\\ast}$. This raises a question: which affine map\nshould estimate the posterior? We provide a characterization of the EnKU among\nall such maps. First, we describe the set $\\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{EnKU}}$ of laws\nwhere the EnKU yields exact conditioning, showing it is larger than the\nGaussian family. Next, we prove that, except for a small class of highly\nsymmetric distributions in $\\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{EnKU}}$ (including Gaussians),\nthe EnKU is the unique exact affine conditioning map. Finally, we ask for the\nlargest possible set $\\mathrm{F}$ where any measure-dependent affine transport\ncould be exact; after characterizing $\\mathrm{F}$, we show the EnKU's exactness\nset is almost maximal:\n$\\mathrm{F}=\\mathrm{E}^{\\mathrm{EnKU}}\\cup\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{nl-dec}}$, where\n$\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{nl-dec}}$ is a small symmetry class. Thus, among affine\ntransports, the EnKU is near-optimal for exact conditioning beyond Gaussians\nand is the unique affine update achieving exactness for any measure in\n$\\mathrm{F}$ except a subclass of strongly symmetric laws."}

First, the stage-wise\nnonlinear inequality constraints in the NMPC problem are embedded via an\naugmented Lagrangian with nonnegative slack variables. We then show that the\nunconstrained augmented Lagrangian formulation of the NMPC admits a Bayesian\ninterpretation: under a Gaussian observation model, its minimizers coincide\nwith MAP estimators, enabling solution via EKI. However, since the\nnonnegativity constraint on the slacks cannot be enforced via Gaussian noise,\nour proposed algorithm results in a two-block ADMM that alternates between (i)\na primal step that minimizes the unconstrained augmented Lagrangian, (ii) a\nnonnegativity projection for the slacks, and (iii) a dual ascent step. To\nbalance exploration and convergence, an annealing schedule tempers covariances\nand penalty weights, thereby encouraging global search early and precise\nconstraint satisfaction later. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nmethod, we compare it with another iterative sampling-based approach based on\nModel Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, called DIAL-MPC."}

Applied to\ninfant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence\nof antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second\nantibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the\nsecond year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the\ninferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and\noutperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly\nspaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates,\nand provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by\nperturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention\nregimens by minimizing microbial disruptions."}

We prove that this maximal fraction is asymptotically\n$O(n^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, for any set of arithmetic restrictions, we\nestablish the existence of a minimal lower bound on the parts beyond which the\ninfluence of these restrictions on the fraction of graphical partitions becomes\nnegligible; in this regime, the fraction depends primarily on the choice of\nthis lower bound. We highlight a key example of partitions restricted to powers\nof 2, where the critical lower bound is found to be\n$\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\log2}+O(\\log n)$."}

While a deep learning-based\nseparation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals\nthat the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently\nsensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes\nan alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time\nthrough a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce\nstochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the\npreviously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening\nHistory-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening\nhistory to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed\ncapacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared\nto the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers\neffective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of\nidentifying such cuts."}

The proposed\nPCBF framework addresses this challenge by extending the prediction horizon to\nconstruct a CBF for an associated system with relative degree one. As a result,\nthe superlevel set of the PCBF coincides with the safe set, simplifying\nconstraint enforcement and eliminating the need for auxiliary functions. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a discrete-time double\nintegrator with input delay and a bicopter system with position constraints."}

In this work, we\nestablish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to\nthe overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian\noptimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over\nstandard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that\nboth iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of\noverparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nprovides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization\nfor faster convergence in matrix sensing."}
