The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an\nalternative that reformulates the partial differential equations on a larger,\nsimpler domain. The original geometry is embedded into the problem by\nrepresenting it with a phase-field function. This paper introduces ddfem, an\nextensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a\nDiffuse Domain formulation. We aim to make the application of a variety of\ndifferent Diffuse Domain approaches more accessible and straightforward to use.\nThe ddfem package includes features to intuitively define complex domains by\ncombining signed distance functions and provides a number of DDM transformers\nfor general second evolution equations. In addition, we present a new approach\nfor combining multiple boundary conditions of different types on distinct\nboundary segments. This is achieved by applying a normalised weighting, derived\nfrom multiple phase fields, to combine the additional boundary terms in the\nDiffuse Domain formulations. The domain definition and Diffuse Domain\ntransformation provided by our package are designed to be compatible with a\nwide range of existing finite element solvers without requiring code\nalterations. Both the original (non-linear) PDEs provided by the user and the\nresulting transformed PDEs on the extended domain are defined using the Unified\nForm Language UFL which is a domain specific language used by a number of\nsoftware packages. Our experiments were carried out using the Dune-Fem\nframework."}

This new filter\nsatisfies a \"filter-swap\" property, such that filtering and finite differencing\ncan be interchanged and the resulting commutator expressions are of structural\nform (they can be written as the discrete divergence of an SFS tensor). For 1D\nconservation laws such as Burgers' equation, the resulting\ndiscretization-consistent SFS expression is markedly different from the\ncommonly used (discretization-inconsistent) expression $\\overline{u u} -\n\\bar{u} \\bar{u}$. For the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we propose\nthree new two-grid filters, based on either volume- or surface-averaging, each\ninducing new discretization-consistent commutator expressions. We show that\nvolume-averaging is required to obtain a commutator expression of structural\nform. However, the resulting SFS tensor is shown to be non-symmetric. Based on\nDNS results, we show that the non-symmetric part of the SFS tensor plays an\nimportant role in the discrete LES equation.

The advantage is\nthat the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as\n$\\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time\nsingularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit\nor semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints.

Despite\nremarkable efforts by influential players in the global EV market, such as\nChina, the United States, and the European Union, the progress in EVCI rollout\nhas been notably slower than anticipated in the rest of the world.

This review dissects the interests\nof these stakeholders, clarifying their respective roles and expectations in\nthe context of EVCI planning.

Unlike traditional views, such\nas the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or\nhidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality,\ninstead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational\ncontexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's\ntheorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by\nreplacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests\non five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and\nobserver-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than\nexisting as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of\nquantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated\ninformation, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence\nwithout special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic\nstructural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe\nconsists entirely of informational relations.

In essence, variational inference\nentails an optimization over a given family of probability distributions to\nchoose the member of this family best approximating the posterior. Variational\nLaplace, an iterative update scheme motivated by this objective, is widely used\nin different contexts in the cognitive neuroscience community. However, until\nnow, the theoretical properties of this scheme have not been systematically\ninvestigated. Here, we study variational Laplace in the light of frequentist\nasymptotic statistics. Asymptotical frequentist theory enables one to judge the\nquality of point estimates by their limit behaviour. We apply this framework to\nfind that point estimates generated by variational Laplace enjoy the desirable\nproperties of asymptotic consistency and efficiency in two toy examples.\nFurthermore, we derive conditions that are sufficient to establish these\nproperties in a general setting. Besides of point estimates, we also study the\nfrequentist convergence of distributions in the sense of total variation\ndistance, which may be useful to relate variational Laplace both to recent\nfindings regarding variational inference as well as to classical frequentist\nconsiderations on the Bayesian posterior. Finally, to illustrate the validity\nof our theoretical considerations, we conduct simulation experiments in our\nstudy examples."}

The proposal is based on the concept of robust\npositively invariant sets and applies the extended Farkas' lemma to derive a\nset of algebraic conditions that define both the control gains and a robust\npositively invariant polyhedron that satisfies the control and state\nconstraints. These algebraic conditions are formulated into a bilinear\noptimization problem aimed at determining the output feedback gains and the\nassociated polyedral robust positively invariant region. The obtained\ncontroller ensures that any closed-loop trajectory originating from the\npolyhedron converges to another smaller inner polyhedral set around the origin\nin finite time, where the trajectory remains ultimately bounded regardless of\nthe persistent disturbances and variations in system parameters. Furthermore,\nby including the sizes of the two polyhedral sets inside the objective\nfunction, the proposed optimization can also jointly enlarge the outer set\nwhile minimizing the inner one. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposal in managing the specified constraints,\ndisturbances, and parameter variations."}

A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using\na limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight\nminimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and\nFrobenius norm.

Until now, statistically consistent inference methods\nhave been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no\ninterdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the\ntheoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a\nmuch broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled\nplanar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks\nthat are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees.\nMoreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is\ncircular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from\nquartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions\nunder the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel\nidentifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary\nmodels, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be\ndistinguished."}
