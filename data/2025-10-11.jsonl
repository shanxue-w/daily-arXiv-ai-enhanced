Individual steps in the measurement\nprocess are modeled by `single projection operators' $p$. These are line\nintegral operators over a collection of curves that covers the regions of\ninterest. Then, the entire measurement process can be understood as a finite\ncollection of such single projections, and thus be modeled by an\n$N$-projections operator $P=(p_1,\\dots,p_N)$. The most well-known example of an\n$N$-projections operator is the restriction of the Radon transform to finitely\nmany projection angles. Characterizations of the range of $N$-projections\noperators are of intrinsic mathematical interest and can also help in practical\napplications such as geometric calibration, motion detection, or model\nparameter identification. In this work, we investigate the range of projection\npair operators $\\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, i.e., operators formed by two\nprojections ($N=2$) applied to functions in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the\nset of annihilators to $\\mathrm{rg}(\\mathcal{P})$ that are regular\ndistributions contains at most one dimension and a range condition can be\nexplicitly determined by what we refer to as `kernel conditions'. With this\ntool, we examine the exponential fanbeam transform for which no range\nconditions were known, finding that no (regular) range condition exists, and\ntherefore, arbitrary data can be approximated in an $L^2$ sense by projections\nof smooth functions. We also illustrate the use of this theory on a mixed\nparallel-fanbeam projection pair operator."}

One\nstrategy to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based solutions for\ntime-dependent PDEs is to use the learned solution as the coarse propagator in\nthe Parareal method and a traditional numerical method as the fine solver.\nHowever, successful integration of deep learning into the Parareal method\nrequires consistency between the coarse and fine solvers, particularly for PDEs\nexhibiting rapid changes such as sharp transitions. To ensure such consistency,\nwe propose to use the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the fully\ndiscrete time-stepping operator defined by the traditional numerical scheme\nused as the fine solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in solving the classical and mass-conservative Allen-Cahn (AC)\nequations. Through iterative updates in the Parareal algorithm, our approach\nachieves a significant computational speedup compared to traditional fine\nsolvers while converging to high-accuracy solutions. Our results highlight that\nthe proposed Parareal algorithm effectively accelerates simulations,\nparticularly when implemented on multiple GPUs, and converges to the desired\naccuracy in only a few iterations. Another advantage of our method is that the\nCNNs model is trained on trajectories-based on random initial conditions, such\nthat the trained model can be used to solve the AC equations with various\ninitial conditions without re-training.

Unlike prior light-emitting diode (LED)-based LeRIS designs with\ndiffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the\nproposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode\ndiversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration.\nWe derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and\norientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce\nthis requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging\ndual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method\nthat uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions\nand guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate\nmillimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high\nspectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate. These findings\nestablish VCSEL-based LeRIS as a scalable and practically integrable enabler\nfor resilient 6G wireless systems with multi-functional PWEs."}

Our\nfirst key contribution is a coupling-based `weight harmonization' scheme that\nproduces a direct, computable, and consistent weighting of interacting Markov\nchains with respect to their target distribution. The second key contribution\nis to show how such consistent weightings of empirical measures can be used to\nprovide upper bounds to f-divergences in general.

For strictly stationary ensembles with\ndecaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the\nmixing profile: ($\\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability,\nwhile stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\\rho$) (resp.\n($\\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the\ntwo-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability\nguarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on\nstationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a\ntransfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS."}

Probab. 2016;\nHenry-Labord\\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\\\"ock et al, Ann.\nProbab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a\nfrictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic\ndisintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a\nno-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is\ncharacterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off\nthe band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an\nequal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs.\n  We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a\ndynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and\nstability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals\nand friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to\nthe frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions,\nmotivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001;\nObizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ.

Applications\ninclude model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian\noptions. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\\\"ock et\nal, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine\ngeometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability,\nand computation in multi-marginal robust pricing."}

A central\nchallenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate\nHaar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford\noperations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able\nto generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial\nquantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford\ngates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design\nonly to a subsystem of size $\\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This \"seed\" design\nis then \"diluted\" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between\ntwo random Clifford operators.

It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from\nthe perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry\nmakes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the\nsame theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.\nThe Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring\nscalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of\nthe energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein\nframe."}

Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be\nefficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions."}

Under standard cryptographic\nassumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits\nthat are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries,\nestablishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have\nfound broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy\nconservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the\ncomputational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed\nand known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of\nenergy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random\ncoefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant\none-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can\ndistinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size\nquantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for\nthese Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether\nenergy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local\nHamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected\ncomputational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic\nrandom unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy\nconservation."}

Our framework\naddresses these difficulties through novel optimization methods or\ninformation-propagation bounds in combination with a priori regularity\nassumptions on the external potential. The resulting algorithm provides a\nunified and robust approach that covers both Coulomb interactions and other\nclasses of physically relevant potentials.

For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic\nfidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of\nasymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher\ninformation. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one\nminus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence\nof each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a\nclear operational meaning.

Our results apply to a substantial\nportion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and\nsymmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group\nin any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of\npseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries.

In this work, we model metastable states as\napproximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master\nequation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal\nstructural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual\ninformation and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the\nlarger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the\nhallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not\nexclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically.
