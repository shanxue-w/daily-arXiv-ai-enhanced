However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature."}

In fracture mechanics, the phase field approach--formulated as a gradient flow of the Griffith fracture energy with Ambrosio-Tortorelli regularization--has gained significant attention for its ability to capture complex crack topologies. In this study, we propose a dynamic fracture phase field model (DF-PFM) based on the elastodynamic wave equation. We further extend this framework by incorporating a unilateral contact condition, yielding a refined model suitable for simulating fault rupture under high pressure. For both models, we rigorously derive energy dissipation identities under mixed boundary conditions, ensuring energy consistency of the formulations. To validate the proposed approach, we conduct numerical experiments using linear implicit time discretization and finite element methods. Our simulations demonstrate that the unilateral contact condition is essential for accurately capturing shear-dominated crack propagation and preventing non-physical interpenetration, especially under high-compression loading scenarios relevant to seismic faulting."}

In this paper, we describe a diagrammatic representation of 3-periodic tangled networks that allows the definition of the untangling number, which can be used as a measure of entanglement complexity. The untangling number, first defined elsewhere for 3-periodic entanglements of filaments and reminiscent of the unknotting number in knot theory, quantifies the minimum distance between a given 3-periodic structure and its least tangled version, called ground state. This distance is measured through a sequence of operations called untangling operations performed on a diagram of a given structure."}

ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints."}

PEGASE especially features a highly efficient cosimulation engine, together with integrated solutions for defining both rule-based control strategies and Model-Predictive Control (MPC). The main principle behind the PEGASE platform is divide-and-conquer. Indeed, rather than trying to solve a problem as a monolithic entity, which can be highly complex for multi-domain large-scale systems, it is often more efficient to decompose it into several domains or sub-problems, and to simulate them in a decoupled way. To provide its cosimulation capabilities, we based PEGASE on two main components. The first one is a framework for integrating simulation models, which can be either compatible with the FMI standard or interfaced through an Application Programming Interface (API). The second one is a multi-threaded sequencer enabling several simulation sequences with different time steps. To provide advanced control capabilities, we also equipped PEGASE with a framework for MPC combining a comprehensive management of predictions data and a modeler dedicated to the formulation of Mixed Integer Linear Programs. We implemented this framework in C++ providing low formulation and resolution times for typical applications. Connection to hardware is also available via standard industry protocols thereby allowing PEGASE to control real energy systems. In this paper, we show how these basic functionalities, combined with dedicated modeling tools, enable setting up simulation and control applications suitable for tackling the complexity of various kinds of energy systems. To illustrate this, we present four application examples from our recent research work. These examples cover several domains, from concentrated solar thermal plants to optimal control of district heating networks. The variety of examples demonstrates the robustness and genericity of the approach."}

To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO."}

The analysis is based on a probabilistic approach assuming that the underlying asset price follows the Schwartz one-factor model, where the volatility of log-returns is time-varying. A difficult challenge in this pricing problem is to solve an analytical formula under the assumption of time-varying log-return volatility, resulting in the realized variance being distributed according to a linear combination of independent noncentral chi-square random variables with weighted parameters. By utilizing the probability density function, we analytically compute the expectation of the square root of the realized variance and derive pricing formulas for volatility swaps. Additionally, we derive analytical pricing formulas for volatility call options. For the payoff function without the square root, we also derive corresponding formulas for variance swaps and variance call options. Additionally, we study the case of constant log-return volatility; simplified pricing formulas are derived and sensitivity with respect to volatility (vega) is analytically studied. Furthermore,we propose simple closed-form approximations for pricing volatility swaps under the Schwartz one-factor model. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods are demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations, and the impact of price volatility and the number of trading days on fair strike prices of volatility and variance swaps is investigated across various numerical experiments."}

Two control strategies are investigated and compared: (i) a reactive rule-based control (RBC) and (ii) a model predictive control (MPC). For the purpose of the study a small scale district heating network is modelled using Modelica. The production plant combines a heat pump, a gas boiler and a thermal solar field on the production side with a storage tank for flexibility purposes. On the consumption side, the virtual buildings are aggregated into a single consumer. We use our co-simulation and control platform, called Pegase, to implement the studied strategies. For both strategies the goal is to meet the consumers' demand while satisfying technical constraints. In addition MPC has the objective to minimize the operational costs, taking into account variable electricity prices and availability of solar thermal resource. Different scenarios are also defined and compared to study the effect of the heat plant sizing and forecasting error. The operational cost is reduced when switching from RBC to a MPC. As can be expected, MPC is more efficient when dealing with variable energy costs, intermittent solar energy and storage capabilities. This study also demonstrates how our tools enable an easy coupling of Modelica-based simulation with various control strategies. It especially supports the implementation and validation of complex MPC strategies in an efficient way, and yearly simulations are performed within 20 minutes."}

By first wrapping the target density into a periodic version through modulo operation and subsequently applying kernel ridge regression in scaled Korobov spaces, we extend the kernel approach proposed by Kazashi and Nobile (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2023) and eliminate its requirement for inherent periodicity of the density function. This key modification enables effective estimation of densities defined on unbounded domains. We establish rigorous mean integrated squared error (MISE) bounds, proving that for densities with smoothness of order $α$ and exponential decay, our method achieves the $\\mathcal{O}(M^{-1/(1+1/(2α)+ε)})$ MISE convergence rate with an arbitrarily small $ε>0$. While matching the convergence rate of the previous kernel approach, our approach applies to a broader class of non-periodic distributions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate significant improvement over traditional kernel density estimation in large-sample regimes."}

To address these issues, we propose the Weak TransNet (WTN) method, based on a Petrov-Galerkin formulation, for solving elliptic PDEs in this work, though its framework may extend to other classes of equations. Specifically, the neural feature space defined by TransNet (Zhang et al., 2023) is used as the trial space, while the test space is composed of radial basis functions. Since the solution is expressed as a linear combination of trial functions, the coefficients can be determined by minimizing the weak PDE residual via least squares. Thus, this approach could help mitigate the challenges of non-convexity and ill-conditioning that often arise in neural network training. Furthermore, the WTN method is extended to handle problems whose solutions exhibit multiscale features or possess sharp variations. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods."}

We have achieved this by using the Sleeping Expert Framework (SEF) [Freund et al., 1997, Devaine et al., 2013], which allows the more efficient use of biased experts (bad on average but which may be good at some point). To deal with the fact that, unlike in Devaine et al.

Alon's Theorem excludes that a polynomial vanishing on a grid contains a monomial with certain properties. This theorem has been generalized in several directions, two of which we will consider in detail: Terence Tao and Van H. Vu (2006), Uwe Schauz (2008) and Michał Lasoń (2010) exclude more monomials, and recently, Bogdan Nica (2023) improved the result for grids with additional symmetries in their side edges.

Whilst minimal surfaces are well understood, Einstein manifolds remain far less so. This exposition synthesises together a set of parallels between minimal surfaces embedded in an ambient three-manifold, and Einstein four-manifolds. These parallels include variational formulations, topological constraints, monotonicity formulae, compactness and epsilon-regularity theorems, and decompositions such as thick/thin and sheeted/non-sheeted structures.\n  Though distinct in nature, the striking analogies between them raises a profound question: might there exist circumstances in which these objects are, in essence, manifestations of the same underlying geometry? Drawing on foundational results such as Jensen's theorem, Takahashi's theorem, and a conjecture of Song, this work suggests a bridge between the two structures. In particular, it shows that certain Einstein four-manifolds admit a minimal immersion into a higher-dimensional sphere. A key example of this is the embedding of $\\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ into $S^{7}$ via the Veronese map, where it arises as a minimal submanifold."}

Going further, we study the homotopy types of moment-angle manifolds associated to Gorenstein Stanley-Reisner ideals with (componentwise) almost linear resolutions. The simplicial complexes that give rise to these manifolds are part of an even larger class that we introduce, which generalises the homological behaviour of cyclic polytopes, stacked polytopes and odd-dimensional neighbourly sphere triangulations.

In particular, we propose a mathematical model that accounts for the spatial segregation observed between two species of mosquito vectors of numerous viruses. Indeed, it has been observed that, in tropical regions, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well established in urban areas whereas Aedes albopictus mosquitoes spread widely in forest regions. Moreover, these species of mosquitoes compete with each other in the larval stage. Based on these observations, we introduce a simple mathematical model to account for this phenomenon. This model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion equations describing the dynamics of the aquatic and aerial phases of each species in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The competition takes place at the aquatic phase and is assumed to be strong which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the system. We first establish a sufficient condition on the parameters to prevent one species from invading another in a homogeneous environment.

RKPM shape functions and their derivatives cannot be accurately integrated with the Gauss-quadrature methods widely employed for the finite element method (FEM) and typically require sophisticated nodal integration techniques, preventing them from easily being implemented in existing FEM software. Interpolation-based methods have been developed to address similar problems with isogeometric and immersed boundary methods, allowing these techniques to be implemented within open-source finite element software. With interpolation-based methods, background basis functions are represented as linear combinations of Lagrange polynomial foreground basis functions defined upon a boundary-conforming foreground mesh. This work extends the applications of interpolation-based methods to implement RKPM within open-source finite element software. Interpolation-based RKPM is applied to several PDEs, and error convergence rates are equivalent to classic RKPM integrated using high-order Gauss-quadrature schemes. The interpolation-based method is able to exploit the continuity of the RKPM basis to solve higher-order PDEs, demonstrated through the biharmonic problem. The method is extended to multi-material problems through Heaviside enrichment schemes, using local foreground refinement to reduce geometric integration error and achieve high-order accuracy. The computational cost of interpolation-based RKPM is similar to the smoothed gradient nodal integration schemes, offering significant savings over Gauss-quadrature-based meshfree methods while enabling easy implementation within existing finite element software."}

Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining."}

Yet, in many real-world settings, missing data can alter decision-making processes, as the absence of key information may affect downstream actions and states. To overcome this limitation, we introduce $lm$-SCMs and $lm$-graphs, which extend $m$-graphs by integrating a label set that represents relevant context-specific independencies (CSI), accounting for mechanism shifts induced by missingness. We define two causal effects within these systems: the Full Average Treatment Effect (FATE), which reflects the effect in a hypothetical scenario had no data been missing, and the Natural Average Treatment Effect (NATE), which captures the effect under the unaltered CSIs in the system. We propose recovery criteria for these queries and present doubly-robust estimators for a graphical model inspired by a real-world application. Simulations highlight key differences between these estimands and estimation methods. Findings from the application case suggest a small effect of ADHD treatment upon test achievement among Norwegian children, with a slight effect shift due to missing pre-tests scores."}

To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments."}

A nonlinear lubrication equation governing the fluid dynamics and appropriate functional settings for this model are presented. It is also shown that this system satisfies a global energy-dissipation law for a suitable energy functional. Optimality conditions are derived for the solution of the minimisation problem of a specified cost function across a time horizon. These conditions are formulated at a continuous level as a system of coupled, forward-backward PDEs, which are subsequently discretised for numerical investigation. To ensure computational efficiency and stability, first-order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping schemes are employed to handle the nonlinearities in the model, and a reduced gradient descent algorithm is applied to obtain a numerical approximation of the optimal control signal. Numerical results illustrate that controlling the thin film, even during rupture, achieves a precise film profile. This control strategy accelerates convergence towards a steady state, reduces instabilities, stabilises dewetting processes, and meets the desired profile specifications."}

While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted $R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization. Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior."}

However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature."}

This paper presents \\textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation. Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication overhead, with up to $12.3\\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility while ensuring strict data confidentiality, making it a practical solution for privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and cross-organizational AI applications."}

This challenge becomes even more acute in many-query contexts, where numerous simulations must be conducted across a range of time and parameter values. Consequently, it is essential to construct reduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower computational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and parameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models is also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear, non-intrusive, data-driven model order reduction method for the 1D-1V Vlasov--Poisson system, discretized using a Hamiltonian Particle-In-Cell scheme. Our approach relies on a two-step projection framework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic Decomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder neural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian neural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages: first, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots; second, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to simultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics. We validate the proposed method on several benchmarks, including Landau damping and two-stream instability. The results show that our method has better reduction properties than standard linear Hamiltonian reduction methods."}

These notes aim to analyze such notion from the perspective offered by the groupoid description of quantum mechanics inspired by Schwinger's picture of quantum mechanics. Then, a natural interpretation of the notion of physical fields as functors among appropriate groupoids will emerge. The domain of a field in this new picture is a groupoid that describes ``test particles'', and its codomain is a groupoid that describes the intrinsic nature of the system being probed. Such a space of functors carries some natural structures, which are best described in a categorical language. Some illustrative examples will be presented that could help clarify the various abstract notions discussed in the text."}

Among various approaches, low-density parity-check codes over higher-order Galois fields have shown promising performance due to their structured sparsity and compatibility with iterative decoding algorithms whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of physical qubits. In this work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum errors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results over the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding rate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical error rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound. These findings highlight the critical role of degeneracy in closing the gap to the fundamental limits of quantum error correction."}

Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation with the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared."}

In this work, a novel dynamical framework is constructed in which convergence arises as a consequence of structured evolution in outcome space, rather than a statistical postulate. Through this formalism, statistical convergence is derived dynamically, revealing an internal structure to randomness and exposing entanglement between successive trials. The system recovers classical LLN behaviour in the large-number limit, while predicting deviations, transient fluctuations, and geometric asymmetries in the early regime. This work inaugurates a new paradigm: dynamical probability mechanics: in which randomness is modelled not as a sequence of disconnected stochastic events, but as a physically structured, feedback-driven process. The theory provides a novel explanatory layer beneath statistical laws and opens pathways toward a mechanistic foundation of probability itself."}

Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers.

The second construction is based on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter regimes."}

The key challenge is the presence of a singular matrix which makes the numerical integration hard and heavy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on semi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs. More precisely we split the drift term as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term. The linear part is approximated implicitly, while the nonlinear part is approximated explicitly. The linear component's role is to handle the singularity issues during the numerical integration without the resolution of nonlinear algebraic equations in the constraint equations. This novel scheme is therefore very efficient for SDAEs in high dimension that come after the spatial discretisation of stochastic partial differential algebraic equations (SPDAEs). To prove the pathwise convergence of our novel scheme, we first derive a equivalent scheme called dual scheme, suitable for mathematical analysis and linked to the inherent stochastic differential equation resulting from the elimination of constraints in the initial SDAEs. We prove that our novel scheme converges to the exact solution with rate $\\frac{1}{2}-ε$, for arbitrary $ε>0$ in the pathwise sense. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in high dimension and to show that our theoretical results are in agreement with numerical experiments."}

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines."}

Many robust loss functions of practical interest-such as those involving truncation or redescending M-estimators-lead to objective functions that are inherently non-convex and non-differentiable. Traditional methods typically focus on a single loss function tailored to a specific contamination model and develop custom algorithms tightly coupled with that loss, limiting generality and adaptability. We introduce GLASD (Global Adaptive Stochastic Descent), a general-purpose black-box optimization algorithm designed to operate over the manifold of positive definite correlation matrices. Unlike conventional solvers, GLASD requires no gradient information and imposes no assumptions of convexity or smoothness, making it ideally suited for optimizing a wide class of loss functions-including non-convex, non-differentiable, or discontinuous objectives. This flexibility allows GLASD to serve as a unified framework for robust estimation under arbitrary user-defined criteria. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations involving contaminated and heavy-tailed distributions, as well as a real-data application to breast cancer proteomic network inference, where GLASD successfully identifies biologically plausible interactions despite the presence of outliers.

We began this analysis in [22] where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established the different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0\\leq γ<1$, including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In this paper, we concentrate in the case where the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This occurs for collision kernels with $γ< 0$ and in particular we focus on $γ\\in (-1,0)$. In such a hyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear description of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the long-time asymptotics for the distribution of velocities and provide the explicit form for the asymptotic profile. Additionally, we discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $γ< -1$. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation describing a stochastic process consisting in a combination of collisions and shear flows.

Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems."}

A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U ρV^\\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U ρV^\\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks."}

Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices.

Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.\n  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.\n  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs.

To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference."}

However, clinically implemented closed-loop techniques have been limited to date to simple control algorithms, due to the inherent uncertainties in the dynamics involved.

The linearity of the KO facilitates the use of linear tools and theories on nonlinear dynamical systems without relying on local approximations. Additionally, the KO has the ability to incorporate forms of domain knowledge such as stability and known variable interactions. It therefore constitutes part of the broader interest in domain-aware or physics-informed machine learning. Hierarchical control and time scale separation are two common properties in engineered systems -- often found together -- that can pose both computational and practical challenges. These properties provide opportunities for further KO-based domain knowledge incorporation, but this has seldom been taken advantage of in the KO literature. This paper focuses on developing and using domain-aware Koopman formulations for systems with hierarchical control, systems with time scale separation, and systems with both. We show how those formulations can be leveraged to quantify the impact of cross-scale interactions on overall stability and to calculate optimal control policies at both fast and slow time scales."}

Computational applications typically use a finite-dimensional approximation to the KO. The KO can also be applied to controlled dynamical systems, and the linearity of the KO then facilitates analysis and control calculations. In principle, the potential benefits provided by the KO, and the way that it facilitates the use of game theory via its linearity, would suggest it as a powerful approach for dealing with multi-agent control problems. In practice, though, there has not been much work in this space: most multi-agent KO work has treated those agents as different components of a single system rather than as distinct decision-making entities. This paper develops a KO formulation for multi-agent systems that structures the interactions between decision-making agents and extends this formulation to systems in which the agents have hierarchical control structures and time scale separated dynamics. We solve the multi-agent control problem in both cases as both a centralized optimization and as a general-sum game theory problem. The comparison of the two sets of optimality conditions defining the control solutions illustrates how coupling between agents can create differences between the social optimum and the Nash equilibrium."}
