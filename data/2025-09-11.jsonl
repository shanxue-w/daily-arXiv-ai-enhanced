We begin with CMS preliminaries and formalize refinement\nin CMS, retaining key structural properties, such as locality. We prove a\nconvergence theorem under contractivity and demonstrate its applicability. To\naddress schemes where contractivity is unknown, we introduce two notions of\nproximity. Our proximity methods relate a nonlinear scheme to another nonlinear\nscheme with known contractivity, rather than to a linear scheme, as in much of\nthe literature. Specifically, the first type proximity compares the two schemes\nafter a single refinement step and, as in the classical theory, yields\nconvergence from sufficiently dense initial data. The proximity of the second\ntype monitors alignment across all refinement levels and provides strong\nconvergence without density assumptions. We formulate and prove the\ncorresponding theorems, and illustrate them with various examples, such as\nschemes over metric spaces of compact sets in $\\R^n$ and schemes over the\nWasserstein space, as well as a geometric Hermite metric space. These results\nextend subdivision theory beyond Euclidean and manifold-valued data for data in\nmetric spaces."}

To address this issue, we propose a\ntractable electromagnetic-compliant holographic ISAC model that characterizes\nmutual coupling in a closed form using coupled dipole approximations. We then\ndevelop an efficient mutual coupling aware holographic beamforming algorithm to\nsuppress sidelobes and enhance ISAC performance. Numerical results validate\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap.

Also, most previous improved schemes\nsuffer from a relatively large exponent p of the ratio of global to local\nsmoothness indicators, which adversely affects the numerical resolution.\nConcerning these limitations, introduced here is an accuracy-optimization lemma\ndemonstrating that the accuracy of nonlinear weights can be enhanced providing\nthat smoothness indicators satisfy specific conditions, thereby establishing a\nmethodology for elevating the accuracy of nonlinear weights.

The distance of CFS,\nwhich plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS\nis applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies\non the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS\nignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap\nof the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the\nHausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski\n(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich\nthe studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation\nability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but\nthe information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the\nCF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information\nutilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy\ncombined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of\nthe CF-IM distance and CF-H distance.

Although it has\nbeen extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number\nof fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal\nregularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions,\nwe rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This\napproach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the\nliterature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \\{v\\in\nH^{1/2}(\\Omega);\\nabla v\\in [H^1/2(\\Omega)]'\\} for which the trace operator is\ncontinuous from $E$ into $L^2(\\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using\nspecific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results\nfor polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$\nholds in any BLD $\\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in\nthe literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which\nestablish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains.\nIn particular, we show that if $u\\in H^{1/2}(\\Omega)$ or $u\\in W^{1,\n2N/(N+1)}(\\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and vanishes on $\\Gamma$, then $u=\n0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties.\nFinally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work\nand an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot\nhold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that\n$H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification."}

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,\nbut as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due\nto fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can\nsimultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel\nsecure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather\nthan a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's\ndata by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding\naccuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs\nsimilarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect\nprivacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based\nprotocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model\naccuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice."}

In this thesis, we\nidentify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches\nto address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and\ndevices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.\nMoreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse\nforms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.\nOur contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical\nadvancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a\nguide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical\nmethods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,\nit offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical\nimplementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse\nprocess is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to\nexamine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,\noften uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study."}

Analyzing such high-dimensional data poses significant challenges,\nsince the feature dimension is often much larger than the sample size. This\nthesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address\nseveral common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first\nmanuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that\naccommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening\nmethod that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual\ninformation, with an intended application in neuroimaging data. This approach\nallows for accurate identification of important variables by capturing\nnonlinear as well as linear relationships between the outcome and covariates.\nBuilding on this foundation, I develop new optimization methods for sparse\nestimation using nonconvex penalties in my second manuscript. These methods\naddress notable challenges in current statistical computing practices,\nfacilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets.\nThe proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems.\nIn my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional\ncorrelated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis\npower-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such\ndistribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian\nmodels by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced\nrobustness to outliers. Additionally, I develop a proximal nonlinear conjugate\ngradient algorithm that accelerates convergence while maintaining numerical\nstability, along with rigorous statistical properties for the proposed\nframework."}

We seek to optimize hundreds of radiosurgery treatment\nplans, corresponding to different weightings of objectives, fast enough to\nincorporate interactive Pareto navigation of clinical trade-offs into the\nclinical workflow. We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) to the linear-program formulation of the optimization problem used in\nLightning. We implement both a CPU and a GPU version of ADMM in Matlab and\ncompare them to Matlab's built-in, single-threaded dual-simplex solver. The\nADMM implementation is adapted to the optimization procedure used in the\nclinical software, with a bespoke algorithm for maximizing overlap between\nlow-dose points for different objective weights. The method is evaluated on a\ntest dataset consisting of 20 cases from three different indications, with\nbetween one and nine targets and total target volumes ranging from 0.66 to 52\ncm3, yielding speedups of 1.6-97 and 54-1500 times on CPU and GPU,\nrespectively, compared to simplex. Plan quality was evaluated by rerunning the\nADMM optimization 20 times, each with a different random seed, for each test\ncase and for nine objective weightings per case. The resulting clinical metrics\nclosely mimicked those obtained when rerunning the simplex solver, verifying\nthe validity of the method. In conclusion, we show how ADMM can be adapted for\nradiosurgery plan optimization, allowing hundreds of high-quality Gamma Knife\ntreatment plans to be created in under two minutes on a single GPU, also for\nvery large cases."}

The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation\nfunctions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series\nas trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a\nproblem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic\nfunctions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first\narchitecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple\ndimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A\none-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and\nphase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,\nseparable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we\nevaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,\nincluding benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of\nOptimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the\nperformance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established\narchitectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs."}
