The\nscheme preserves positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy\nand a minimum principle of the specific entropy, as well as global properties,\nsuch as total energy balance. The scheme uses an operator splitting approach\ncomposed of two subsystems: the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics\nand a source system. The source system couples the electrostatic potential,\nmomentum, and Lorentz force, thus incorporating electrostatic plasma and\ncyclotron motions. Because of the high-frequency phenomena it describes, the\nsource system is discretized with an implicit time-stepping scheme. We use a\nPDE Schur complement approach for the numerical approximation of the solution\nof the source system. Therefore, it reduces to a single non-symmetric\nPoisson-like problem that is solved for each time step.\n  Our focus with the present work is on the efficient solution of problems\nclose to the magnetic-drift limit. Such asymptotic limit is characterized by\nthe co-existence of slowly moving, smooth flows with very high-frequency\noscillations, spanning timescales that differ by over 10 orders of magnitude,\nmaking their numerical solution quite challenging.\n  We illustrate the capability of the scheme by computing a diocotron\ninstability and present growth rates that compare favorably with existing\nanalytical results. The model, though a simplified version of the\nEuler-Maxwell's system, represents a stepping stone toward electromagnetic\nsolvers that are capable of working in the electrostatic and magnetic-drift\nlimits, as well as the hydrodynamic regime."}

To further enhance generalization ability while reducing\ntraining costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a\nnew framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable\nmatrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis\nunder sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental\ntrade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a\nhigher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound\nof pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between\nempirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error,\nwhich, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On\nthe other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop\nat the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To\naddress this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper\nbound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and\nresource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption\nconstraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\\&B)-based method is\nproposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high\ncomputational complexity of the B\\&B-based method, a penalized successive\nconvex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain\nits high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and\nimproving the generalization capability."}

In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a\nvariable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function\n(PDF), $p(\\xi)$, after random waiting times $\\theta$. This model is relevant\nacross many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum\ndots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a\ngeneral analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by\naveraging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for\nstationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and\njump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key\nresults emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function\nquickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting\ntimes with $\\mu>2$, , \\emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically\nreduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time\npoints}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the\nsystem's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible.\nFurthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes\nindependent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring\nonly modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory\nlengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the\ntwo-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending\nsolely on the variance of $\\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study\nextends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class\nof renewal-type stochastic processes."}

A hallmark of our construction is that the effective\nradius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a\ncoupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound\nand consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The\nmodels preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically\nexcluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this\nclass of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the\nnon-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the\ncoupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges\ncorrectly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A\nfurther subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source\ncharge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge\narising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the\nself energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in\nthe strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike\nstructure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically.

First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad\nclass of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution\nof uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the\nnonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling\nproblem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution\nsupported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the\nobjective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient\ninformation. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides\npractical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise\nduring the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible\nregion, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically\noptimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform\ndesign task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms\nexisting methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80%\noverhead reduction."}

However, the\nclassical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to\ninstability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or\ndata-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the\nso-called soft-constrained Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the\nterminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on\nDoob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\\\"odinger\npotentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an\noptimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic\noptimal transport problem.

We review classical and recent results in this area, and their\napplications to various areas of mathematics."}

This definition finds strong support\nthrough its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and\nthermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum\nprocesses, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden\nunits are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having\nfully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot\ndistillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and\nmax-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These\nrates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a\nmultiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its\noperational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the\nathermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of\nathermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity\ndistillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work\nconnects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and\nmaximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing\ncapabilities."}

In this work, we focus on several\napproaches to vector calculus in the non-smooth setting of complete and\nseparable metric spaces equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. More\nprecisely, we study different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations\nappearing in the literature, as well as their mutual relation. We also carry\nforward a thorough investigation of gradients, divergence measures, and\nLaplacian measures, together with their applications in potential analysis (for\nexample, regarding the condenser capacity) and in the study of duality\nproperties of Sobolev spaces. Most of the results are obtained for the full\nrange of exponents $p\\in[1,\\infty)$ and without finiteness assumption on the\nmeasure."}

Our construction integrates seamlessly with\nstandard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning\nquantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when\npresent. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the\neffectiveness of our method."}

Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to\nfavor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically\nhard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic\nderived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS\nsamples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this\nsignal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background\nnodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS\nand quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal\na sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured\nhard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal,\nmaking detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings\nprovide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain\ncomputationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate\nfurther investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum\napproaches for this problem."}

The main\nresult here establishes that, as $N\\to\\infty$, the empirical distribution of\nthe $(N,p)$-BBM converges to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit described by a\nfree boundary problem on a finite interval with two moving boundaries, and\nexplicit Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions parametrized by $p$.
