We investigate a variational framework in a bounded space-time cylinder $Q$ with a new solution space and the test space $L^2(Q)$ for source terms in $L^2(Q)$. Using existence and uniqueness results in $H^1(Q)$, we prove that this variational setting fits the inf-sup theory, including an isomorphism as solution operator. Moreover, we show that the new solution space is not a subspace of $H^2(Q)$. This new uniqueness and solvability result is not only crucial for discretizations using space-time methods, including least-squares approaches, but also important for regularity results and the analysis of related space-time boundary integral equations, which form the basis for space-time boundary element methods."}

When posed in the frequency domain, this problem can be formulated as seeking a low-order rational function approximation of a high-order rational function.

Algorithmically, this procedure is an iterative greedy approach, where the greedy objective is evaluated through an error estimator that exploits the linearity of the frequency domain representation. The greedy framework is motivated through theoretical results of rational approximability of functions. This framework provides a principled approach to rational compression of high-order rational functions, and provides a computational pathway for model reduction of parametric LTI systems."}

Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions."}

Very recently, Huang et al. (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2025) proposed new Schrödinger-Föllmer samplers (SFS), based on the Euler discretization of the Schrödinger-Föllmer diffusion evolving on the unit interval $[0, 1]$. There, a convergence rate of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{h})$ in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance was obtained for the Euler discretization with a uniform time step-size $h>0$.\n  By incorporating a temperature parameter, different samplers are introduced in this paper, based on the Euler discretization of the Schrödinger-Föllmer process with temperatures. As revealed by numerical experiments, high temperatures are vital, particularly in sampling from multimodal distributions. Further, a novel approach of error analysis is developed for the time discretization and an enhanced convergence rate of order ${ \\mathcal{O}(h)}$ is obtained in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance, under certain smoothness conditions on the drift. This significantly improves the existing order-half convergence in the aforementioned paper. Unlike Langevin samplers, SFS is of gradient-free, works in a unit interval $[0, 1]$ and does not require any ergodicity. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rate and show that, the SFS substantially outperforms vanilla Langevin samplers, particularly in sampling from multimodal distributions."}

This notion yields a clean stability certificate: we establish a unified lower bound over both real and complex fields, and in the real case also an upper bound, each in terms of the reciprocal kernel Cheeger constant. Our framework treats finite- and infinite-dimensional settings uniformly and covers discrete, semi-discrete, and continuous measurement domains.

Filtered cospans can be decomposed, under modest hypotheses, into certain standard elementary summands, giving rise to a notion of persistence diagram for filtered cospans that is amenable to computation.

We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions."}

The first one is a finite difference (FD) Central Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENO) scheme on a traditional Cartesian mesh, while the second one is an ADER (Arbitrary high order Derivatives) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme on 2D unstructured polygonal meshes. The latter, in particular, represents a preliminary step in view of a full 3D numerical relativity calculation on moving meshes. Both schemes are equipped with a well-balancing (WB) property, which allows to preserve the equilibrium of a priori known stationary solutions exactly at the discrete level. We validate our numerical approaches by successfully reproducing standard vacuum test cases, such as the robust stability, the linearized wave, and the gauge wave tests, as well as achieving long-term stable evolutions of stationary black holes, including Kerr black holes with extreme spin. Concerning the coupling with matter, modeled by the relativistic Euler equations, we perform a classical test of spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, as well as an evolution of a perturbed non-rotating neutron star, demonstrating the capability of our schemes to operate also on the full Einstein-Euler system. Altogether, these results provide a solid foundation for addressing more complex and challenging simulations of astrophysical sources through DG schemes on unstructured 3D meshes."}

By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting.

Due to their thermodynamic compatibility the class of SHTC systems satisfies an additional conservation law for the total energy and many PDE in this class of equations also satisfy stationary differential constraints (involutions). First, we propose a simple semi-discrete cell-centered HTC finite volume scheme that employs collocated grids and that is compatible with the total energy conservation law, but which does not satisfy the involutions. Second, we develop a fully discrete semi-implicit finite volume scheme that conserves total energy and which can be proven to satisfy also the involution constraints exactly at the discrete level. This method is a vertex-based staggered semi-implicit scheme that preserves the basic vector calculus identities $\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\times A = 0$ and $\\nabla \\times \\nabla φ= 0$ for any vector and scalar field, respectively, exactly at the discrete level and which is also exactly totally energy conservative. The main key ingredient of the proposed implicit scheme is the fact that it uses a discrete version of the symmetric-hyperbolic Godunov-form of the governing PDE system. This leads naturally to sequences of symmetric and positive definite linear algebraic systems to be solved inside an iterative fixed-point method used in each time step. We apply our new schemes to three different SHTC systems. In particular, we consider the equations of nonlinear acoustics, the nonlinear Maxwell equations in the absence of charges and a nonlinear version of the Maxwell-GLM system. We also show some numerical results to provide evidence of the stated properties of the proposed schemes."}

A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris.

Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored."}

Such models arise naturally in many contemporary applications, where $f$ is the loss function for data misfit, and $g$ and $h$ are nonsmooth functions for inducing desirable structures in $x$ and $c(x)$. Existing single-loop algorithms mainly focus either on the case where $h$ is Lipschitz continuous or the case where $h$ is an indicator function of a closed convex set. In this paper, we develop a single-loop algorithm for more general possibly non-Lipschitz $h$. Our algorithm is a single-loop variant of the successive difference-of-convex approximation method (SDCAM) proposed in [22]. We show that when $h$ is Lipschitz, our algorithm exhibits an iteration complexity that matches the best known complexity result for obtaining an $(ε_1,ε_2,0)$-stationary point.

Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models.

This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions.

We show numerically that these extensions preserve the spectral accuracy, efficiency, and fast direct-solver structure of the HPS framework. The method is further extended to time dependent and evolving surfaces, and its performance is demonstrated through numerical experiments on reaction-diffusion systems, and geometry driven surface evolution."}

A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy.

To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and Roth-Lempel codes are two representative families of non-GRS codes that have attracted significant attention. Though substantial work has been devoted to the construction and structural analysis of TGRS and Roth-Lempel codes, comparatively little attention has been paid to their decoding, and many problems remain open. In this paper, we propose list and unique decoding algorithms for TGRS codes and Roth-Lempel codes based on the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm. Under suitable parameter conditions, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time in the code length, improving upon the previously best-known quadratic-time complexity. Our TGRS decoder supports fixed-rate TGRS codes with up to O(n^2) twists, substantially extending prior work that only handled the single-twist case. For Roth-Lempel codes, we provide what appears to be the first efficient decoder. Moreover, our list decoders surpass the classical unique-decoding radius for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we incorporate algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes into the list-decoding framework, enabling recovery of the correct message from the output list with high probability."}

While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $Λ-θ$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz."}

More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.\n  At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions.

The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and minimum stopping set size. Theoretical and numerical results show that the improved coupled ensemble can achieve better distance performance than the standard coupled ensemble. We introduce the essential preliminaries and analytical tools needed to analyze the iterative decoding threshold of coupled ensembles over any finite field. We consider a class of memoryless channels with special symmetry, termed q-ary input memoryless symmetric channels (QMSCs), and show that, for these channels, the distribution of channel messages (in form of probability vectors) likewise exhibits this symmetry. Consequently, we define symmetric probability measures and their reference measures on a finite-dimensional probability simplex, analyze their foundational properties and those of their linear functionals, endow their respective spaces with metric topologies, and conduct an in-depth study of their degradation theory. Based on our analytical framework, we establish a universal threshold saturation result for both of the coupled ensembles over a q-ary finite field on QMSCs. Specifically, as the coupling parameters increase, the belief-propagation threshold of a coupled system saturates to a well-defined threshold that depends only on the underlying ensemble and the channel family."}

Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers."}

When the system is $C^k$, we can only ensure the existence of a $C^k$ solution, but the integral manifolds must be $C^{k+1}$.

For such methods, a lower per-iteration cost is advantageous when solving larger models. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a gradient-based algorithm with lower per-iteration cost than existing methods.

Such relations yield syzygies, or functional dependencies relating different invariants. We apply this approach in an extended case study of the independent invariants that can be constructed from an antisymmetric $3$-form $H_{μνρ}$ in six dimensions, finding five independent invariants. This result confirms that the most general Lagrangian for such a $3$-form, which depends on $H_{μνρ}$ but not its derivatives, is an arbitrary function of five variables, and we give explicit formulas relating other invariants to the five independent scalars in this generating set."}

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks."}

Building on this foundation, we propose a single-index bandit algorithm and establish its convergence rate. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that the algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret independent of the ambient dimension $d$, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality.\n  We also establish an impossibility result for adaptation: without additional assumptions, no policy can adapt to unknown smoothness levels. Under a standard self-similarity condition, however, we construct a policy that remains minimax-optimal while automatically adapting to the unknown smoothness. Finally, as the dimension $d$ increases, our algorithm continues to achieve minimax-optimal regret, revealing a phase transition that characterizes the fundamental limits of single-index bandit learning."}

Moreover, an expected convergence rate for the source error is derived in a weaker topology. We also extend the analysis to the fully discrete case with finite element discretization, showing that the overall error depends only on the noise level, regularization parameter, time step size, and spatial mesh size.

The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules.\n  This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras.\n  The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework."}

However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers."}

Baxter transformed those conditions into a systematic theory of exact solvability in statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems. This article is written in memory of Baxter and Yang, whose work revealed how local consistency principles generate global mathematical structure. We review the Yang-Mills formulation of gauge theory, its mass obstruction and resolution via symmetry breaking, and the geometric framework it engendered, including instantons, Donaldson-Floer theory, magnetic monopoles, and Hitchin systems. In parallel, we trace the emergence of the Yang-Baxter equation from factorised scattering to solvable lattice models, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons theory.

While classical theory classifies problems by the cost of exact solution, modern computation often seeks only decision-valid approximations. We introduce a framework where \"computation\" is viewed as the efficient simulation of a target statistical experiment within a bounded risk distortion (Le Cam deficiency).\n  We formally define computational deficiency ($δ_{\\text{poly}}$) and use it to construct the complexity class LeCam-P (Decision-Robust Polynomial Time), characterizing problems that may be syntactically hard but semantically easy to approximate. We show that classical Karp reductions can be viewed as zero-deficiency simulations, and that approximate reductions correspond to bounded deficiency. Furthermore, we establish the No-Free-Transfer Inequality, showing that strictly invariant representations inevitably destroy decision-relevant information. This framework offers a statistical perspective on approximation theory, bridging the gap between algorithmic complexity and decision theory."}

However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings."}

The first part focuses on novel algebraic and geometric approaches to the classification problem of coboundary Lie bialgebras up to Lie algebra automorphisms. More specifically, Grassmann, graded algebra and algebraic invariant techniques are discussed. Using these algebraic methods, equivalence classes of r-matrices for three-dimensional coboundary Lie bialgebras are studied. Moreover, particular higher-dimensional cases, e.g. $\\mathfrak{so}(2,2)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3,2)$, are partially analysed. From the geometric perspective, the main role is played by the newly introduced notion: the Darboux family. This powerful tool allows an efficient and thorough study of equivalence classes of r-matrices for four-dimensional indecomposable coboundary Lie bialgebras. In order to showcase its ability to tackle decomposable examples, $\\mathfrak{gl}_2$ is additionally studied. The second part of the Thesis sketches interesting directions for applications of r-matrices. Firstly, it is illustrated how r-matrices might be useful to describe foliated Lie-Hamilton systems. Secondly, the role of r-matrices in deformations of certain cases of Lie systems is discussed. In particular, based on the general procedure for deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, its extension to Jacobi-Lie systems is suggested and supported by the detailed computation of the deformed Schwarz equation."}

The analysis is performed in a body-fixed reference frame, so that the fluid occupies an exterior domain and the propulsion mechanism is modeled through nonhomogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface. Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, where partial slip effects are significant. Under suitable smallness assumptions on the boundary flux and on the normal component of the prescribed surface velocity, we establish the existence of weak steady solutions to the coupled fluid-structure system. A key analytical ingredient is the derivation of a Korn-type inequality adapted to exterior domains with rigid-body motion and Navier-slip interfaces, which yields uniform control of both the fluid velocity and the translational and rotational velocities of the body. Beyond existence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a prescribed slip velocity on the body surface induces nontrivial translational or rotational motion of the rigid body. This is achieved through the introduction of a finite-dimensional thrust space, defined via auxiliary exterior Stokes problems with Navier boundary conditions, which captures the effective contribution of boundary-driven flows to the rigid-body motion. Our results clarify how boundary effects generate propulsion and extend the classical Dirichlet-based theory to the Navier-slip setting."}

Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.\n  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality.\n  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained."}

It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication."}

This shows that the pattern is highly inhomogenenous and exhibits a clustering effect especially at small scales, and thus a significant departure to the bivariate (inhomogeneous) Poisson point process is pointed out.

How do we compute accurate and reliable approximations of these spectra? The former question is studied in spectral geometry, and the latter is a central concern in numerical analysis. In this short expository survey we revisit the process of eigenvalue approximation, from the perspective of computational spectral geometry. Over the years a multitude of methods -- for discretizing the operator and for the resultant discrete system -- have been developed and analyzed in the field of numerical analysis. High-accuracy and provably convergent discretization approaches can be used to examine the interplay between the spectrum of an operator and the geometric properties of the spatial domain or manifold it is defined on. While computations have been used to guide conjectures in spectral geometry, in recent years approximation-theoretic tools and validated computations are also being used as part of proof strategies in spectral geometry.\n  Given a particular spectral feature of interest, should we discretize the original problem, or seek a reformulation? Of the many possible approximation strategies, which should we choose? These choices are inextricably linked to the objective: on the one hand, rapid, specialized methods are often ideal for conjecture formulation (prioritizing efficiency and accuracy), whereas schemes with guaranteed, computable error bounds are needed when computation is incorporated into a proof strategy. We also review instances where the demanding requirements of spectral geometry -- the need for rigorous error control or the robust calculation of higher eigenvalues -- motivate new developments in numerical analysis."}

A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder.

On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices."}

Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored."}

By exploiting the sparsity inherent in generalized polynomial chaos expansions, we derive hierarchical preconditioners based on truncated stochastic expansion that strike an effective balance between computational cost and preconditioning quality.

We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself.

We further introduce an exponentially-fitted 4D spatiotemporal flux operator that symmetrizes the convection-diffusion operator and enables a well-posed variational formulation. Finally, we prove that the temporally-perturbed formulation converges to the original time-dependent convection-diffusion model as the perturbation parameter tends to zero."}

A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy.

In particular, we prove that any proper species sampling process can be written, at the prior level, as a finite mixture with a latent truncation variable and reweighted atoms, while preserving its distributional features exactly. These finite formulations can be used as drop-in replacements in Bayesian mixture models, recasting posterior computation in terms of familiar finite-mixture machinery.

At the same time, [Chen-Zhang-Zhu, http:arXiv:2512.18545, 2025] also independently proved the existence of global large solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system. Notably, in the work of Huang-Meng-Zhang, they also established the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy equality in both two and three dimensions, and the viscous shallow water equations are precisely a specific class of isentropic compressible fluids subject to the BD entropy equality. In this paper, we prove a new BD entropy inequality for a class of non-isentropic compressible fluids, which can be regarded as a generalization of the shallow water equations with transported entropy. Employing new estimates on the lower bound of density different from that of Huang-Meng-Zhang's work, we show the \"viscous shallow water system with transport entropy\" will admit global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the spherically symmetric initial-boundary value problem in both two and three dimensions. Our results also relax the restrictions on the dimension and adiabatic index imposed in Huang-Meng-Zhang's work on the shallow water equations, extending the range from $N=2,\\ γ\\ge \\frac{3}{2}$ to $N=2,\\ γ> 1$ and $N=3,\\ 1<γ<3$."}

Conventional cancellation methods such as the extensive cancellation algorithm require careful tuning and can distort the delay-Doppler response. This paper introduces a convex optimization framework that adaptively synthesizes per-cell delay-Doppler filters to suppress clutter while preserving the canonical cross-ambiguity function (CAF). The approach formulates a quadratic program that minimizes distortion of the CAF surface subject to linear clutter-suppression constraints, eliminating the need for a separate cancellation stage. Monte Carlo simulations using common communication waveforms demonstrate strong clutter suppression, accurate CFAR calibration, and major detection-rate gains over the classical CAF. The results highlight a scalable, CAF-faithful method for adaptive clutter mitigation in passive radar."}

This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.\n  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling."}

In this work, we propose a method based on self-supervised neural operators for open-loop optimal control problems. It offers a new paradigm by directly approximating the mapping from system conditions to optimal control strategies, enabling instantaneous inference across diverse scenarios once trained. We further extend this framework to more complex settings, including dynamic or partially observed environments, by integrating the learned solution operator with Model Predictive Control (MPC). This yields a solution-operator learning method for closed-loop control, in which the learned operator supplies rapid predictions that replace the potentially time-consuming optimization step in conventional MPC. This acceleration comes with a quantifiable price to pay. Theoretically, we derive scaling laws that relate generalization error and sample/model complexity to the intrinsic dimension of the problem and the regularity of the optimal control function. Numerically, case studies show efficient, accurate real-time performance in low-intrinsic-dimension regimes, while accuracy degrades as problem complexity increases. Together, these results provide a balanced perspective: neural operators are a powerful novel tool for high-performance control when hidden low-dimensional structure can be exploited, yet they remain fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dimensional complexity in more challenging settings."}

This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.\n  A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.\n  Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system. The scheme uses particle filtering to represent the evolving belief and regression techniques to approximate the adjoint, which yields a practical algorithm for computing near optimal controls under partial information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both linear and nonlinear examples and highlights in particular the benefits of actively controlling the observation process."}

Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors.

These skein relations can then be applied to investigate structural properties of cluster algebras from punctured surfaces. In particular, they can be used to prove the existence of bases satisfying natural positivity and compatibility conditions. This extends existing work on surface cluster algebras by incorporating punctures in the interior of the surface, thereby enlarging the class of cluster algebras for which such skein relations and bases can be constructed."}

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI."}

From a classical sampling perspective, it is well-known that monotonicity is untestable. By contrast, we show from the design-based perspective -- in which the units in the population are fixed and only treatment assignment is stochastic -- that the distribution of treatment effects in the finite population (and hence whether monotonicity holds) is formally identified. We argue, however, that the usual definition of identification is unnatural in the design-based setting because it imagines knowing the distribution of outcomes over different treatment assignments for the same units. We thus evaluate the informativeness of the data by the extent to which it enables frequentist testing and Bayesian updating. We show that frequentist tests can have nontrivial power against some alternatives, but power is generically limited. Likewise, we show that there exist (non-degenerate) Bayesian priors that never update about whether monotonicity holds. We conclude that, despite the formal identification result, the ability to learn about monotonicity from data in practice is severely limited."}

Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models."}

In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%."}

The most standard approach is to report the plain average of each outcome. Despite simplicity, the estimates are noisy when the sample sizes or mean parameters are small. In contrast, the Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are able to boost the average accuracy by borrowing information across tasks. Nevertheless, the EB methods require a Bayesian model where the parameters are sampled from a prior distribution which, unlike the commonly-studied Gaussian case, is unidentified due to discreteness of binomial measurements. Even if the prior distribution is known, the computation is difficult when the sample sizes are heterogeneous as there is no simple joint conjugate prior for the sample size and mean parameter.\n  In this paper, we consider the compound decision framework which treats the sample size and mean parameters as fixed quantities. We develop an approximate Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) for the average mean squared error given any class of estimators. For a class of machine learning-assisted linear shrinkage estimators, we establish asymptotic optimality, regret bounds, and valid inference. Unlike existing work, we work with the binomials directly without resorting to Gaussian approximations. This allows us to work with small sample sizes and/or mean parameters in both one-sample and two-sample settings.

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains."}

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices."}

FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds.

Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios.

Recently, it has been shown that the emissivity and absorptivity of thermal emitters can be controlled independently in nonreciprocal emitters. While significant progress has been made in engineering these nonreciprocal thermal emitters, realizing a highly efficient, pattern-free emitter capable of supporting dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission remains a challenging task. Existing solutions are largely based on metamaterials and exhibit polarization-dependent behavior. This work proposes pattern-free multilayer heterostructures combining magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and systematically evaluates their nonreciprocal emission performance for p- and s-polarized waves. The findings show that omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocity can be achieved utilizing multilayer structures with different magnetization directions that do not follow simple vector summation. To further enhance the performance, Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, enabling the maximization of nonreciprocal thermal emission in a given wavelength range. This approach offers a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities."}

Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters.

Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description.\n  Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \\emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds'' argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.\n  Our method is independent of prior work and, together with our prequel paper, this work is largely self-contained."}

Overshoots, biphasic dynamics, adaptation kinetics, fold-change detection, entrainment, and cumulative exposure effects often determine phenotypic outcomes, yet are poorly captured by classical steady-state or dose-response analyses. This paper develops an input-output perspective on such \"dynamic phenotypes,\" emphasizing how qualitative features of transient behavior constrain underlying network architectures independently of detailed parameter values. A central theme is the role of sign structure and interconnection logic, particularly the contrast between monotone systems and architectures containing antagonistic pathways. We show how incoherent feedforward (IFF) motifs provide a simple and recurrent mechanism for generating non-monotonic and adaptive responses across multiple levels of biological organization, from molecular signaling to immune regulation and population dynamics. Conversely, monotonicity imposes sharp impossibility results that can be used to falsify entire classes of models from transient data alone. Beyond step inputs, we highlight how periodic forcing, ramps, and integral-type readouts such as cumulative dose responses offer powerful experimental probes that reveal otherwise hidden structure, separate competing motifs, and expose invariances such as fold-change detection. Throughout, we illustrate how control-theoretic concepts, including monotonicity, equivariance, and input-output analysis, can be used not as engineering metaphors, but as precise mathematical tools for biological model discrimination. Thus we argue for a shift in emphasis from asymptotic behavior to transient and input-driven dynamics as a primary lens for understanding, testing, and reverse-engineering biological networks."}

Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function.

We show that isochrons form an invariant, continuous structure of the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle, helping to clarify the concept of the asymptotic phase. Second, we systematically explain how to derive the first-order phase reduction for weakly perturbed and coupled systems. In the end, we discuss the limitations of the first-order approach, particularly its restriction to very small perturbations and the issue of vanishing coupling terms in certain networks.

This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.\n  A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.\n  Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system.

This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.\n  A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.\n  Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system.

Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $Λ<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form."}

Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.\n  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality.\n  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained."}

The structure of our transform is governed by a Cayley--Hamilton-type theory valid in commutative rings of characteristic zero, together with a novel polynomial-matrix identity specific to convolution. Beyond these analytic aspects, we uncover an intrinsic connection between convolution and the Bruhat order on the symmetric group, illuminating the combinatorial aspect of this functional operation.

You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones."}

Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions). We explore the features of these unions, and show that they are pseudo-positive geometries, in contrast to positive geometry of a single oriented region. For all non-planar diagrams which are \\emph{internally planar} there always exists a strongly connected geometry, and for those that are \\emph{irreducible}, there exists a geometry with no spurious facets. We also prove that the already known identity moves, square and sphere moves, form the complete set of identity moves for all MHV on-shell diagrams."}

For every pattern of length three we obtain limit theorems for the asymptotic distribution of the (appropriately centered and scaled) number of fixed points of a random fixed point biased involution avoiding that pattern. When the pattern being avoided is either $321$, $132$, or $213$, we find a phase transition depending on the strength of the bias. We also obtain a limit theorem for distribution of fixed points when the pattern is $123\\cdots k(k+1)$ for any $k$ and partial results when the pattern is $(k+1)k\\cdots 321$."}

We construct a discrete analogue of an antiholomorphic involution and classify the topological types of discrete real Riemann surfaces, recovering the classical results on the number of real ovals and the separation of the surface.\n  Central to our approach is the construction of a symplectic homology basis adapted to the discrete involution. Using this basis, we prove that the discrete period matrix admits the same canonical decomposition $Π= \\frac{1}{2} H + i T$ as in the smooth setting, where $H$ encodes the topological type and $T$ is purely imaginary. This structural result bridges the gap between combinatorial models and the classical theory of real algebraic curves."}
