By exploiting the stabilizing effect induced by the\nbackground magnetic field and constructing a hierarchy of four energy\nfunctionals, we establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of\nthe viscosity in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and the vertical resistivity. A\nkey innovation in our analysis is the development of a two-tier energy method,\nwhich couples the boundedness of conormal derivatives with the decay of\ntangential derivatives. These global conormal regularity estimates, together\nwith sharp decay rates, enable us to rigorously justify the vanishing\ndissipation limit and derive explicit long-time convergence rates to the MHD\nsystem with vanishing dissipation in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and no\nvertical magnetic diffusion.

This\npaper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what\nthis equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two\ncomplementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation\nby the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals\nU, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality\npreserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U->T\n(coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)->M(T) and the unique counting\nhomomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of\ninformation loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by\nworldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that\npreserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem:\nA+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled\ncopy. The numeral \"2\" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable\nafter an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity.\nConclusion.

A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance\nGeometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial\nBranch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in\nprotein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the\ninterval Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced,\nincorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this\nwork, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the\nthree-dimensional interval DDGP (\\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into\nangular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The\n\\textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the\nneed for explicit constraint checking. The \\textit{i}TBP algorithm further\nincorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and\nplanarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal\nmathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for\ngenerating biologically meaningful \\textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both\n\\textit{i}ABP and \\textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \\textit{i}BP in terms\nof solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \\textit{i}TBP\nyields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB\nstructures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations."}

The numerical solution of the graph Allen-Cahn equation via a convexity\nsplitting or the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, albeit being a widely used\napproach, requires the calculation of a graph Laplacian eigendecomposition and\nrepeated projections over the unit simplex to maintain valid partitions.

In this paper, we\nstudy how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that\nrespect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general\nmulti-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These\nexternalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the\ntraversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.\n  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as\nWardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are\nnetworks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that\nthe minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.\nThis allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit\nschemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under\nmild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in\ntraffic networks."}

By treating time as an additional spatial dimension, we\ndiscretise the governing equations using a stabilised continuous Galerkin\nspace-time finite element method. The resulting large all-at-once system is\nsolved using an iterative Krylov solver preconditioned with a parallel\nspace-time multigrid method employing a semi-coarsening strategy. Implemented\nin a fully parallel computing framework, the method yields a parallel-in-time\nmethod that demonstrates excellent scalability on a distributed-memory\nsupercomputer, solving problems up to 4.2 billion degrees of freedom.\nComparative studies show up to 52x speed-up over traditional time-stepping\napproaches, with only moderate increases in total computational cost in terms\nof core-hours. The framework is validated on benchmark problems with both\ntime-constant and time-varying designs, and its flexibility is demonstrated\nthrough variations in material properties. These results establish the proposed\nspace-time method as a promising approach for large-scale time-dependent\ntopology optimisation in thermal applications."}

Periodically\ndriven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics\neven in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and\nHamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior.

A celebrated result of this\ntype, due to Alon-Fischer-Newman and Lov\\'asz-Szegedy, states that for graphs\nof bounded VC dimension, one can reduce the tower-type bounds to polynomial.\n  The graph regularity lemma has been extended to the setting of $k$-graphs by\nGowers, Nagle-R\\\"odl-Schacht-Skokan, and Tao. Unfortunately, these lemmas come\nwith even larger Ackermann-type bounds. Chernikov-Starchenko and Fox-Pach-Suk\nconsidered a strong notion of $k$-graph VC dimension and proved that $k$-graphs\nof bounded VC dimension have regular partitions of polynomial size. Shelah\nintroduced a weaker and combinatorially natural notion of dimension, called\nVC$_2$ dimension, which has since been extensively studied. In particular,\nChernikov, Towsner, Terry, and Wolf asked if one can improve the worst case\nbounds for 3-graph regularity when the 3-graph has bounded VC$_2$ dimension.\nOur main result in this paper answers this question positively in the following\nstrong sense: in the setting of bounded VC$_2$ dimension, one can reduce the\nbounds for 3-graph regularity by one level in Ackermann hierarchy. Furthermore,\nour new bound is best possible.\n  Our proof has two key steps. We first introduce a new method for designing\nregularity lemmas for graphs of bounded VC dimension, based on the cylinder\nregularity lemma. We then prove a hypergraph version of the cylinder regularity\nlemma, which allows us to extend this method to hypergraphs. We also highlight\na few other applications of this cylinder regularity lemma, which we expect to\nfind many other uses."}
