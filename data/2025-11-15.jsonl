In this paper, we first present a fully discrete semi-implicit method for solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation based on the third-order backward differentiation formula and the one-sided extrapolation (using previous time-step numerical values). A projection step is further used to preserve the length of the magnetization. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the fully discrete numerical solution by the introduction of two sets of approximated solutions where one set of solutions solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the other is projected onto the unit sphere. Third-order accuracy in time and fourth order accuracy in space is obtained provided that the spatial step-size is the same order as the temporal step-size and slightly large damping parameter $α$ (greater than $\\sqrt{2}/2$). And also, the unique solvability of the numerical solution without any assumption for the step-size in both time and space is theoretically justified, using a monotonicity analysis. All these theoretical results are guaranteed by numerical examples in both 1D and 3D spaces."}

We develop a composite statistical channel that combines distance dependent absorption, turbulence induced fading characterized by the mixture Exponential Generalized Gamma (EGG )distribution, and beam misalignment due to pointing errors.

These difficulties motivate the development of methods that blend classical analysis with numerical approximation approaches embodied in the framework of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In addition, despite the extensive use of PINN frameworks for various linear and nonlinear PDEs, no study had previously established rigorous error estimates for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation within a PINN setting. In this work, we overcome the inherent challenges, and establish several global regularity criteria based on space-time integrability conditions in Besov spaces.

The (preconditioned) conjugate gradient (P)CG method is also employed and presented for comparison. The N(P)CG method is defined as a one-dimensional projection with residuals made orthogonal to the current search direction, itself made $A$-orthogonal to the last search direction. The residual orthogonality, expressed via Frobenius inner product, actually holds against all previous search directions, making each iterate globally optimal, that is, that minimizes the Frobenius A-norm of the error over the affine Krylov subspace of $A^2$ generated by the initial gradient. The LO(P)MR method is a two-dimensional projection method that enriches iterates produced by the (preconditioned) minimal residual (P)MR method. These approaches differ from existing descent methods and aim to accelerate convergence compared to other global iteration methods, including (P)MR and (preconditioned) steepest descent (P)SD, previously used for SPAI computation. The methods are implemented with practical dropping strategies to control the growth of nonzero components in the approximate inverse. Numerical experiments are performed in which approximate inverses of several sparse SPD matrices are computed. N(P)CG provides a slight improvement over (P)SD, but remains generally less effective than (P)MR. On the other hand, while (P)CG does improve (P)MR, its convergence is more affected by the dropping of nonzero components, ill-conditioning, and small eigenvalues. LO(P)MR is more robust than (P)MR and (P)CG, consistently outperforms other methods, converging faster to better and often sparser approximations."}

While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations.

Lie group analysis characterizes these symmetries through infinitesimal generators, which provide a local, linear criterion for invariance.

This work introduces a numerical scheme that approximates infinitesimal generators from data sampled on an unknown smooth manifold, enabling the recovery of continuous symmetries without requiring the analytical form of the differential equations. We employ a manifold learning technique, Generalized Moving Least Squares, to prolongate the data, from which a linear system is constructed whose null space encodes the infinitesimal generators representing the symmetries.

However, fluctuations in passenger demand require varying train services across different periods, necessitating adjustments to the periodic timetable. This study addresses a hybrid periodic train timetabling problem, which enhances the flexibility and demand responsiveness of a given periodic timetable through schedule adjustments and aperiodic train insertions, taking into account the rolling stock circulation. Since timetable modifications may affect initial passenger routes, passenger routing is incorporated into the problem to guide planning decisions towards a passenger-oriented objective. Using a time-space network representation, the problem is formulated as a dynamic railway service network design model with resource constraints. To handle the complexity of real-world instances, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm integrating Benders decomposition and column generation, enhanced with multiple preprocessing and accelerating techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and highlight the advantage of hybrid periodic timetables in reducing passenger travel costs."}

All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated.

The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Ampère measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Ampère measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier & Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast.

Various new interesting extentions of old, classical results on Bergman projections will be provided in our survey. Previously all these results were given in various papers of the first author. Bergman type projections have many nice applications in complex function theory of several complex variables in tubular domains over symmetric cones and in bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains. Our results can be seen as direct extensions of previously known results provided earlier by E.Stein, D.Bekolle, D.Debertol, B.F.Sehba, W.S.Cohn, C.Nana, L.Chen, Sh.Zhang and others which relate function spaces with the same dimension. Practically all results on Bergman type projections acting between function spaces with different dimension may be valid both in context of tubular and pseudoconvex domains with similar proofs though we formulate some results only in tube or pseudoconvex domains. Some our results are new even in case of simplest unit disk and polydisk. Problems which are related with Bergman type projection acting between various analytic and measurable function spaces of different dimensions in various complicated domains in C^n are as far as we know completely new and may have various new interesting applications in compex function theory. In this paper various new interesting problems in this research area will also be formulated and posed by authors. Our results may be valid also with very similar proofs in various Siegel domains of second type, matrix domains, bounded symmetric domains and various other domains in C^n with complicated structure."}

An important and the most challenging part of this analysis is the extraction and effective description of cycles, when many of them coalesce into complex clusters. A deterministic minimum cycle basis (MCB) is generally non-unique and biased to the vertex enumeration. The union of all MCBs, called the set of relevant cycles, is unique, but may grow exponentially with the graph size. To resolve these issues, we propose a method to sample an MCB uniformly at random. The output MCB is statistically well-defined, and its size is proportional to the number of edges. We review and advance the theory of graph cycles from previous works of Vismara, Gleiss et al., and Kolodzik et al. In particular, we utilize the polyhedron-interchangeability (pi) and short loop-interchangeability (sli) classes to partition the relevant cycles. We introduce a postprocessing step forcing pairwise intersections of relevant cycles to consist of a single path. This permits the definition of a dual graph whose nodes are cycles and edges connect pairs of intersecting cycles. The pi classes identify building blocks for crystalline structures. The sli classes group together sets of large redundant cycles. We present the application to an amorphous hydrocarbon network, where we (i) theorize how the number of relevant cycles may explode with system size and (ii) observe small polyhedral structures related to diamond."}

Here the coefficients are regular and not assumed to be of convolution type. We show that, under mild regularity assumptions, these equations can be lifted in a Sobolev space, whose Hilbertian structure allows us to attack the problem through a dynamic programming approach. We are then able to use the theory of viscosity solutions on Hilbert spaces to characterise the value function of the control problem as the unique solution of a parabolic equation on Sobolev space. We provide applications and examples to illustrate the usefulness of our theory, in particular for a certain class of time inconsistent principal agent problems. As a byproduct of our analysis, we introduce a new Markovian approximation for Volterra type dynamics."}

Entropically regularized optimal transport (EOT) has become the standard bearer in many statistical applications as it avoids this curse. Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable. However, its potentials are not smooth (do not belong to a Donsker class) and its dual problem is not strongly concave, hence QOT is often assumed to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we show that QOT nevertheless has parametric sample complexity. More precisely, we establish central limit theorems for its dual potentials, optimal couplings, and optimal costs. Our analysis is based on novel arguments that focus on the regularity of the support of the optimal QOT coupling. Specifically, we establish a Lipschitz property of its sections and leverage VC theory to bound its statistical complexity. Our analysis also leads to gradient estimates of independent interest, including $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the population potentials."}

As a key technical ingredient, our proof employs a simultaneous blow-up and push-forward scheme for harmonic functions and their energy measures, allowing us to control the limiting behavior across scales without invoking heat kernel bounds or explicit geometric models. The main theorem is applied in particular to inhomogeneous Sierpinski gaskets, which do not possess self-similarity or uniform geometric structure. Our method provides a general analytic perspective that can be used to study the one-dimensional probabilistic structure of diffusions through martingale additive functionals."}

Still, many model-theoretic ideas, tools and techniques work perfectly fine in positive logic. Importantly, there is a compactness theorem. With some care, many classical results hold in the generality of positive logic without giving up any strength.\n  In these self-contained notes we give an introduction to model theory in positive logic. We give a complete treatment of the basics of positive model theory and then we move on to deeper model-theoretic concepts. First, we discuss countable categoricity, where we work towards a theorem that characterises countably categorical positive theories. After that, we briefly discuss how the convenient formalism of monster models goes through in positive logic as usual. This is helpful in the remainder of the notes, where we discuss simple and stable theories. The main aim in those chapters is to develop dividing independence and prove Kim-Pillay style theorems. For a smoother treatment we assume thickness, which is the relatively mild assumption that being an indiscernible sequence is type-definable. We finish by discussing two big applications of positive logic: hyperimaginaries and continuous logic. For the former we define an $(-)^{\\text{heq}}$ construction, analogous to the $(-)^{\\text{eq}}$ construction for imaginaries in full first-order logic. Where the $(-)^{\\text{heq}}$ construction is problematic in full first-order logic, it does stay within the framework in positive logic and it preserves many nice properties. For the latter we explain how continuous logic can be studied as a special case of positive logic, making it so that all abstract model-theoretic results in positive logic apply to continuous theories.\n  In the appendix we provide a quick guide to the material covered in these notes, including very brief proof sketches."}

Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law.

We establish its connections with other classical tensor decompositions. Furthermore, implicit neural representation (INR) is employed to continuously represent the factor tensors in Multiple decomposition, enabling the method to generalize to non-grid data. We refer to this INR-based Multiple decomposition as Implicit Multiple Tensor Decomposition (IMTD). Then, the Proximal Alternating Least Squares (PALS) algorithm is utilized to solve the IMTD-based tensor reconstruction models.

To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems."}

As a key technical ingredient, our proof employs a simultaneous blow-up and push-forward scheme for harmonic functions and their energy measures, allowing us to control the limiting behavior across scales without invoking heat kernel bounds or explicit geometric models.

This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $η_k$ approaches to 0. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy and efficiency in solving semilinear elliptic optimal control problems, corroborating theoretical insights."}

This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks."}

The Itô-mBm is an alternative to the classical mBm, and has been shown to admit more intuitive sample path properties in case the Hurst function is rough. In this paper, we show that the Itô-mBm also allows for a simplified statistical treatment compared to the classical mBm. In particular, estimation of the local Hurst parameter $H(t)$ with Hölder exponent $η>0$ achieves rates of convergence which are standard in nonparametric regression, whereas similar results for the classical mBm only hold for the smoother regime $η>1$.

By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR). This methodology supports early-stage uncertainty-informed design, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of reinforced concrete rail bridges in the face of practical constraints and changing site conditions."}

The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are commonly employed to solve such problems. However, existing algorithms often rely on vanishing step sizes, strong convexity assumptions, or entail substantial computational overhead to ensure convergence or obtain favorable complexity. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we integrate consensus optimization and operator splitting techniques (see Problem Reformulation) to develop a novel stochastic splitting algorithm, termed the \\emph{stochastic distributed regularized splitting method} (S-D-RSM). In practice, S-D-RSM performs parallel updates of proximal mappings and gradient information for only a randomly selected subset of agents at each iteration. By introducing regularization terms, it effectively mitigates consensus discrepancies among distributed nodes. In contrast to conventional stochastic methods, our theoretical analysis establishes that S-D-RSM achieves global convergence without requiring diminishing step sizes or strong convexity assumptions. Furthermore, it achieves an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$ with respect to both the objective function value and the consensus error. Numerical experiments show that S-D-RSM achieves up to 2--3$\\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. These results not only validate the algorithm's theoretical guarantees but also demonstrate its effectiveness in practical tasks such as compressed sensing and empirical risk minimization."}

By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate.

To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications."}

Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Ampère measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Ampère measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier & Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast.

Our approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes the graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion. This induces a neighborhood structure, from which we define the model-oriented distance as the length of a shortest path through neighbors, yielding a metric in the space of graphs. We apply this framework to both probabilistic graphical models (e.g., undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs) and causal graphical models (e.g., directed acyclic graphs and maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs). We analyze the theoretical and empirical behaviors of model-oriented distances. Algorithmic tools are also developed for computing and bounding these distances."}

Unlike other unfitted space-time finite element approaches that commonly employ the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for time-stepping, the proposed method employs a fully coupled space-time discretization. To stabilize the time-advection term, the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is applied in the temporal direction. A ghost penalty stabilization term is further incorporated to mitigate the small cut issue, thereby ensuring the well-conditioning of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, an a priori error estimate is derived in a discrete energy norm, which achieves an optimal convergence rate with respect to the mesh size. In particular, a space-time Poincare-Friedrichs inequality is established to support the condition number analysis. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings."}

In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes.

Capturing these interactions requires a quantitative description that bridges the molecular alterations of AD with the fast electrophysiological dynamics of epilepsy. We introduce a novel mathematical model that extends the Barreto-Cressman ionic formulation by incorporating multiple mechanisms of calcium dysregulation induced by amyloid-$β$, including formation of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable pores, overactivation of voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and suppression of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive potassium currents. The resulting ionic model is coupled with the monodomain equation and discretized using a $p$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes, providing an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy in capturing the sharp spatiotemporal electrical wavefronts associated with epileptiform discharges. Numerical simulations performed on idealized and realistic brain geometries demonstrate that progressive amyloid-\\textbeta{} accumulation leads to severe alterations in calcium homeostasis, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and pathological seizure propagation. Specifically, high amyloid-$β$ concentrations produce secondary epileptogenic sources and spatially heterogeneous wavefronts, indicating that biochemical inhomogeneities play a critical role in shaping seizure dynamics. These results illustrate how multiscale modeling provides new mechanistic insights into the interplay between neurodegeneration and epilepsy in Alzheimer's disease."}

A crucial element of a non-Newtonian model is the rheology, which relates inner stresses with strain-rates. We propose a framework for inferring rheological models from data that represents the fluid's effective viscosity with a neural network. By writing the rheological law in terms of tensor invariants and tailoring the network's properties, the inferred model satisfies key physical and mathematical properties, such as isotropic frame-indifference and existence of a convex potential of dissipation. Within this framework, we propose two approaches to learning a fluid's rheology: 1) a standard regression that fits the rheological model to stress data and 2) a PDE-constrained optimization method that infers rheological models from velocity data. For the latter approach, we combine finite element and machine learning libraries. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on land and sea ice rheologies which also depend on external parameters. For land ice, we infer the temperature-dependent Glen's law and, for sea ice, the concentration-dependent shear component of the viscous-plastic model. For these two models, we explore the effects of large data errors. Finally, we infer an unknown concentration-dependent model that reproduces Lagrangian ice floe simulation data.

The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant.

Entropically regularized optimal transport (EOT) has become the standard bearer in many statistical applications as it avoids this curse. Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable. However, its potentials are not smooth (do not belong to a Donsker class) and its dual problem is not strongly concave, hence QOT is often assumed to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we show that QOT nevertheless has parametric sample complexity. More precisely, we establish central limit theorems for its dual potentials, optimal couplings, and optimal costs. Our analysis is based on novel arguments that focus on the regularity of the support of the optimal QOT coupling. Specifically, we establish a Lipschitz property of its sections and leverage VC theory to bound its statistical complexity. Our analysis also leads to gradient estimates of independent interest, including $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the population potentials."}

Tube OCPs predict a tube of trajectories in order to capture predictive uncertainty. The tube induces a constraint tightening via additional backoff terms. This backoff can significantly affect the performance, and thus implicitly defines a cost of uncertainty. Optimizing the feedback law used to predict the tube can significantly reduce the backoffs, but its online computation is challenging.\n  Riccati-ZORO jointly optimizes the nominal trajectory and uncertainty tube based on a heuristic uncertainty cost design. The algorithm alternates between two subproblems: (i) a nominal OCP with fixed backoffs, (ii) an unconstrained tube OCP, which optimizes the feedback gains for a fixed nominal trajectory. For the tube optimization, we propose a cost function informed by the proximity of the nominal trajectory to constraints, prioritizing reduction of the corresponding backoffs.

Noncancellation allows us to detect parts of the length spectrum from the Laplace spectrum and conclude rational integrability for the deformed geodesic flow (Liouville metrics are folklorically conjectured to be the only Riemannian metrics with integrable geodesic flow on the torus). We then use the second variational formula to show how the preservation of a single rational torus is sufficient to conclude triviality of the deformation, assuming linearity.

This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $η_k$ approaches to 0. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy and efficiency in solving semilinear elliptic optimal control problems, corroborating theoretical insights."}

First, we answer a question raised by Barber by showing that the number of $k$-uniform MLCIFs on a ground set of size $n$ grows as a doubly-exponential function of $k$, which we identify up to a log factor in the exponent. Among these MLCIFs we identify $k$ specific MLCIFs -- which we call the canonical MLCIFs -- as being in a meaningful way the most important MLCIFs. Specifically, our second main result shows that the canonical MLCIFs are precisely those which can have maximum weight among all $k$-uniform MLCIFs under a non-trivial increasing weight function, and moreover that each canonical MLCIF is the unique $k$-uniform MLCIF of maximum weight for some increasing weight function.

The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions. In addition, we show that when $n\\ge5$, the minimal boundary problem possesses infinitely many sign-changing solutions on the unit ball. Our approach is variational and relies on the analysis of suitable conformal invariants and sharp energy estimates derived from Escobar's work."}

However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization."}

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems."}

We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details.

However, this approach is limited to third-order tensors and enforces uniformity in the lower dimensions across all factor tensors, which restricts its flexibility and applicability. To address these issues, we propose the Multiple decomposition, a novel framework that generalizes triple decomposition to arbitrary order tensors and allows the short dimensions of the factor tensors to differ. We establish its connections with other classical tensor decompositions. Furthermore, implicit neural representation (INR) is employed to continuously represent the factor tensors in Multiple decomposition, enabling the method to generalize to non-grid data. We refer to this INR-based Multiple decomposition as Implicit Multiple Tensor Decomposition (IMTD). Then, the Proximal Alternating Least Squares (PALS) algorithm is utilized to solve the IMTD-based tensor reconstruction models. Since the objective function in IMTD-based models often lacks the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property, we establish a KL-free convergence analysis for the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems."}

At each step, one ball is drawn uniformly at random from each urn, and the chosen balls are redistributed among the urns based on a permutation drawn from a distribution $μ$ on the symmetric group $S_d$. We study the mixing time of this Markov chain for fixed $m$, $d$, and $μ$, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. We show that there is cutoff whenever the chain on $[d]$ corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, and that the same holds for a labeled version of the model. As an application, we also obtain partial results on cutoff for a card shuffling version of the model in which the cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters."}

Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints."}

In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control."}

This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem."}

A crucial element of a non-Newtonian model is the rheology, which relates inner stresses with strain-rates. We propose a framework for inferring rheological models from data that represents the fluid's effective viscosity with a neural network. By writing the rheological law in terms of tensor invariants and tailoring the network's properties, the inferred model satisfies key physical and mathematical properties, such as isotropic frame-indifference and existence of a convex potential of dissipation. Within this framework, we propose two approaches to learning a fluid's rheology: 1) a standard regression that fits the rheological model to stress data and 2) a PDE-constrained optimization method that infers rheological models from velocity data. For the latter approach, we combine finite element and machine learning libraries. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on land and sea ice rheologies which also depend on external parameters. For land ice, we infer the temperature-dependent Glen's law and, for sea ice, the concentration-dependent shear component of the viscous-plastic model. For these two models, we explore the effects of large data errors. Finally, we infer an unknown concentration-dependent model that reproduces Lagrangian ice floe simulation data. Our method discovers a rheology that generalizes well outside of the training dataset and exhibits both shear-thickening and thinning behaviors depending on the concentrations."}

These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs."}

Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics."}
