In unfitted configurations, these methods impose consistent modified boundary conditions on the computational boundary. Due to the high algebraic complexity of very high order schemes, the stability is studied by visualizing the eigenspectrum of the discretized operators. A recent study on the SB method demonstrated that its Taylor expansion can be formulated as a direct polynomial correction. In this work, we prove that the ROD minimization problem admits an analogous polynomial correction. This unified perspective provides significant benefits: algorithmically, it greatly simplifies the implementation of ROD by eliminating the need for linear system inversions at each iteration; mathematically, it enables a rigorous stability study. For completeness, a side-by-side stability analysis of the ROD and SB methods is presented for polynomials up to degree 6. Furthermore, due to the stability restrictions of embedded methods for hyperbolic problems, a coupling with both explicit and implicit time integration is investigated. A set of numerical experiments confirms the findings of the stability study."}

A recent concept introduced by Ekbatani, Natura, and Végh, the circuit imbalance, serves as a complexity measure relevant to iteration bounds for circuit-based augmentation and circuit diameters, as well as the general interpretability of circuits in terms of the underlying application. In this paper, we analyze linear programming formulations of relaxed combinatorial optimization problems to prove two contrasting types of results related to the circuit imbalance.\n  On one hand, we identify simple and common constraint structures, in particular arising in graph-theoretic problems, that inherently lead to an exponential circuit imbalance. These constructions show that, in quite general situations, working with the entire set of circuits poses significant challenges for an application of circuit augmentation or the study of circuit diameters.\n  On the other hand, through a case study of two classic graph-theoretic problems with exponential imbalance, the vertex graph coloring problem and the maximum weight forest problem, we exhibit the existence of sets and subsets of highly interpretable circuits of (best-case) imbalance 1. These sets correspond to the recoloring of vertices or to the addition or removal of edges, respectively, for example generalizing classic concepts of Kempe dynamics in coloring. Their interpretability in terms of the underlying application facilitates a study of circuit walks in the corresponding polytopes. We prove that a restriction of circuit walks to these sets suffices to not only guarantee reachability of the integral extreme-points of the skeleton, but leads to linear and constant circuit diameter bounds, respectively."}

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble."}

We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning.

Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared."}

By employing Fourier spectral collocation in space and a two-stage ERK2 scheme in time, we construct a fully discrete numerical method that preserves the original energy dissipation property. The uniform-in-time boundedness of the numerical solution is rigorously proven in the discrete $H^1$ and $H^2$ norms under a mild time-step condition, and an $\\ell^\\infty$ bound is derived via a discrete Sobolev embedding. These results remove the typical boundedness assumption required in previous energy-stability analyses, thereby establishing unconditional energy dissipation for the fully discrete scheme. Building on this uniform boundedness, we derive an optimal-order error estimate in the $\\ell^2$ norm. The analytical framework developed herein is general and can be extended to higher-order exponential integrators for a broader class of phase-field models."}

In the case of two dimensions and using complex structures, we introduce a novel multisymplectic framework that is fit for the generalization of the elliptic methods from symplectic geometry. Besides proving a Darboux theorem, we show that the $L^2$-gradient lines of our multisymplectic action functional are now pseudo-Fueter curves defined using a compatible almost hyperkähler structure."}

The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on density power-divergence and $γ$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination."}

In contradistinction, under projective determinacy (PD), we show that in all dimensions greater than one, there exist pairs of noncompact, connected manifolds whose homeomorphism groups are elementarily equivalent but which are not homeomorphic. We also show that under PD, every manifold of positive dimension admits pairs of homeomorphisms with the same type which are not conjugate to each other.

Since the concept was introduced by Gale in 1954, several increasingly strong criteria have been developed to characterize indecomposability. Our first contribution is a new indecomposability criterion that unifies and generalizes most of the previous techniques. The key new ingredient of our method is the introduction of the graph of (implicit) edge dependencies, which has broader applications in the study of deformation cones of polytopes, beyond indecomposability. One of our main applications is providing new indecomposable deformed permutahedra that are not matroid polytopes. In 1970, Edmonds posed the problem of characterizing the extreme rays of the submodular cone, that is, indecomposable deformed permutahedra. Matroid polytopes from connected matroids give one such family of polytopes. We provide a new infinite disjoint family by taking certain graphical zonotopes and deeply truncating 1 or 2 specific vertices. In this way, we construct $2 \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ new indecomposable deformations of the $n$-permutahedron in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We also showcase other applications of our tools. For example, we use them to refute a conjecture by Smilansky (1987) stating that an indecomposable polytope needs to have few vertices with respect to its number of facets. We provide bounds on the dimension of deformation cones and characterize certain of their rays, we introduce parallelogramic Minkowski sums whose deformation cone can be written as a product of deformation cones, and we construct indecomposable polytopes via truncations and stackings."}

Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings."}

More precisely, we prove that, in a neighbourhood of the origin, the system is analytically equivalent to a Hamiltonian vector field whose Hamiltonian assumes the classical normal form associated with the type of the equilibrium: $H(x,y)=F(x^{2}+y^{2})$ in the elliptic case and $H(x,y)=-F(x^{2}-y^{2})$ in the hyperbolic case, where $F$ is real-analytic and completely determined by the dynamics. We also show that the conjugacy can be chosen equivariant, that is, commuting with the reversing involution.\n  We further discuss the problem of \\emph{global} equivalence, which in general remains open, even in the planar case. In dimensions greater than $2$ the situation becomes even more delicate: the equivalence between reversible and Hamiltonian systems is known only at the \\emph{formal} level, and the existence of an analytic conjugacy, even locally, is still a widely open problem."}

These methods iteratively construct and solve quadratic programming (QP) subproblems to compute directions that converge to a local minimum. While numerous open-source and commercial SQP algorithms are available, their implementations lack the transparency and modularity necessary to adapt and fine-tune them for specific applications or to swap out different modules to create a new optimizer. To address this gap, we present OpenSQP, a modular and reconfigurable SQP algorithm implemented in Python that achieves robust performance comparable to leading algorithms. We implement OpenSQP in a manner that allows users to easily modify or replace components such as merit functions, line search procedures, Hessian approximations, and QP solvers. This flexibility enables the creation of tailored variants of the algorithm for specific needs. To demonstrate reliability, we present numerical results using the standard configuration of OpenSQP that employs a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function for the line search and a quasi-Newton BFGS method for approximating the Hessians. We benchmark this configuration on a comprehensive set of problems from the CUTEst test suite. The results demonstrate performance that is competitive with proven nonlinear optimization algorithms such as SLSQP, SNOPT, and IPOPT."}

Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers.

Specifically, we consider the high-order spectra defined via the $k$-adjacency tensor. Within this framework, we prove that a graph admits a non-empty $k$-core if and only if the spectral radius of the $k$-adjacency tensor is greater than or equal to $1$. Moreover, when the $k$-core exists, vertices corresponding to positive entries in the Perron vector of the $k$-adjacency tensor belong to the $k$-core. We thus define the $k$-order eigenvector centrality via the Perron vector, which provides both membership identification and a measure of relative influence within the $k$-core. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the properties of this centrality measure in some real-world networks."}

We prove that the conformal time separation function $τ_Ω$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes.

Recently, by using a new equivalence between quasi-orthogonality and inf-sup stability of the underlying problem, it was shown that an adaptive Crank-Nicolson scheme for the heat equation is optimal under a severe step size restriction.

However, commonly used stochastic gradient-based methods often perform poorly on these parameter training problems and typically lack convergence guarantees. The stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method provides a robust preconditioner of the stochastic gradient, whose computational cost becomes prohibitive for large parameter spaces owing to the repeated inversion of large covariance matrices. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a warm-started stochastic reconfiguration (WSSR) method, which integrates warm-start techniques from singular value decomposition (SVD) to refine low-rank approximations of the preconditioning matrix iteratively. Numerical experiments on typical atomic and molecular systems highlight the effectiveness of the WSSR method within VMC calculations."}

It is a crucial tool in the development of crystalline cohomology; it is also used in $p$-adic Hodge theory to define the crystalline period ring. As an algebra, this universal divided power algebra has a fairly simple definition that shows that it is a graded algebra. The main difficulty in Roby's theorem lies in constructing a divided power structure on its augmentation ideal. To that aim, Roby identified the graded pieces with another universal structure: homogeneous polynomial laws.We formalize the first steps of the theory of polynomial laws and show how future work will allow to complete the formalization of the above-mentioned divided power structure.

This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication."}

Liu, J. Comp. Phys., 228(19), 2009]. The method enforces the divergence-free constraint implicitly, removing velocity--pressure compatibility conditions and eliminating pressure boundary layers. Consistent boundary conditions are imposed, also for settings with open and traction boundaries. Hence, accuracy in time is no longer limited by a splitting error.\n  The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method is used for second spatial derivatives. The convective term is treated in a semi-implicit manner, which relaxes the CFL restriction of explicit schemes while avoiding the need to solve nonlinear systems required by fully implicit formulations. For improved mass conservation, Leray projection is combined with divergence and normal continuity penalty terms.\n  By selecting appropriate fluxes for both the divergence of the velocity field and the divergence of the convective operator, the consistent pressure boundary condition can be shown to reduce to contributions arising solely from the acceleration and the viscous term for the $L^2$ discretization. Per time step, the decoupled nature of the scheme with respect to the velocity and pressure fields leads to a single pressure Poisson equation followed by a single vector-valued convection-diffusion-reaction equation. We verify optimal convergence rates of the method in both space and time and demonstrate compatibility with higher-order time integration schemes. A series of numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional flow around a cylinder benchmark and the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex problem, verify the applicability to practically relevant flow problems."}

Adopting a functional analysis viewpoint, we rely on the multivariate Carleman condition for measure determinacy rather than algebraic compactness. We prove that finite degree projections of the quadratic module are dense in the cone of positive polynomials with respect to the square norm induced by the measure. Based on these density results, we prove the convergence of a regularized hierarchy without invoking any Positivstellensatz. Furthermore, we propose a penalized formulation of the hierarchy which, combined with Bernstein-Markov inequalities, provides a monotonically non-decreasing sequence of certified lower bounds on the global minimum. The approach is illustrated on several benchmark problems known to be difficult or ill-posed for the standard hierarchy."}

The energies under consideration consist of a non-convex bulk term and a higher-order regularizing term and are subject to incompatible boundary conditions. In contrast to existing results in the literature, in this work, admissible fields are not necessarily gradient fields, instead their curl is linked to topological singularities, so-called vortices, in the discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-model. The main result of this work is a scaling law for the minimal energy with respect to three parameters: one measuring the incompatibility of the boundary conditions, the second measuring the strength of the regularizing term, and the third being related to the interatomic distance in the discrete model. The shown result implies in particular that in certain parameter regimes, minimizers necessarily develop vortices. A key tool in the analysis is a careful modification of the celebrated ball-construction technique that, due to a lack of rigidity, considers simultaneously both the bulk energy and the regularizing term."}

This vector field is tangent to the Milnor fibers at radius zero and the union of the stable manifolds of their singularities yields a spine of each fiber, which can be described explicitly. This is very much inspired by a recent work of the authors.\n  Our first main contribution is the algorithmic computation of the algebraic monodromy and integral variation map as matrices with explicit bases for any Milnor fiber in the Milnor fibration, not merely congruence classes.

We prove that the invariant spine naturally carries a gyrograph structure were the weights are given by the Hironaka numbers, and that this structure recovers the geometric monodromy as a homotopy class, as well as the integral variation map.

However, high power consumption and hardware costs of Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) in massive MIMO create practical challenges. To mitigate these, recent work proposes low-resolution DACs-restricting transmitted signals to finite voltage levels-to cut power and costs. This requires studying quantized precoding: signals are processed via a linear precoding matrix, then quantized by DACs. In this paper, we explore the linear-quantized precoding model and its statistically or asymptotically equivalent variants. We derive error bounds for two key metrics:Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and Symbol Error Probability (SEP), based on the linear-quantized model and its equivalent counterparts. We also formulate and analyze the SINR maximization problem in both asymptotic and finite-dimensional scenarios. Our analysis shows that as system dimensions scale, finite-dimensional problem solutions/values converge to their asymptotic equivalents-underscoring the practical value of asymptotic insights with stability guarantees. These findings theoretically support robust precoding design under hardware constraints, enabling efficient massive MIMO implementation with low-resolution DACs.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying."}

This paper proposes an $α$-potential game framework for decentralized CAV control. We show that computing $α$-NE reduces to solving a decentralized control problem, and derive tight bounds of the parameter $α$ based on interaction intensity and asymmetry. We further develop scalable policy gradient algorithms for computing $α$-NEs using decentralized neural-network policies.

Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too."}

Our main focus lies on the Lorentzian case, where, motivated by the need to extend classical notions to spaces of low regularity, we provide the first consistent notion of conformal length, and analyse its fundamental properties. We prove that the conformal time separation function $τ_Ω$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $τ_Ω$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes.

This vector field is tangent to the Milnor fibers at radius zero and the union of the stable manifolds of their singularities yields a spine of each fiber, which can be described explicitly. This is very much inspired by a recent work of the authors.\n  Our first main contribution is the algorithmic computation of the algebraic monodromy and integral variation map as matrices with explicit bases for any Milnor fiber in the Milnor fibration, not merely congruence classes.

The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem."}

To address this gap, we present OpenSQP, a modular and reconfigurable SQP algorithm implemented in Python that achieves robust performance comparable to leading algorithms. We implement OpenSQP in a manner that allows users to easily modify or replace components such as merit functions, line search procedures, Hessian approximations, and QP solvers. This flexibility enables the creation of tailored variants of the algorithm for specific needs. To demonstrate reliability, we present numerical results using the standard configuration of OpenSQP that employs a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function for the line search and a quasi-Newton BFGS method for approximating the Hessians. We benchmark this configuration on a comprehensive set of problems from the CUTEst test suite. The results demonstrate performance that is competitive with proven nonlinear optimization algorithms such as SLSQP, SNOPT, and IPOPT."}

The edges are endowed with nonnegative capacities $b$ giving upper bounds on ``contract intensities'', and the preferencies of each ``agent'' $v\\in V$ depend on a \\emph{choice function} (CFs) that acts on the set of ``contracts'' involving $v$, obeying three well motivated axioms of \\it{consistence}, \\it{substitutability} and \\it{cardinal monotonicity}.

We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system.

The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems.

However, the energetic framework typically relies on symmetry in synaptic or weight matrices - a constraint that excludes biologically realistic systems such as excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) networks. When symmetry is relaxed, the classical notion of a global energy landscape fails, leaving the dynamics of asymmetric neural systems conceptually unanchored. In this work, we extend the energetic framework to asymmetric firing rate networks, revealing an underlying game-theoretic structure for the neural dynamics in which each neuron is an agent that seeks to minimize its own energy. In addition, we exploit rigorous stability principles from network theory to study regulation and balancing of neural activity in E-I networks. We combine the novel game-energetic interpretation and the stability results to revisit standard frameworks in theoretical neuroscience, such as the Wilson-Cowan and lateral inhibition models. These insights allow us to study cortical columns of lateral inhibition microcircuits as contrast enhancer - with the ability to selectively sharpen subtle differences in the environment through hierarchical excitation-inhibition interplay. Our results bridge energetic and game-theoretic views of neural computation, offering a pathway toward the systematic engineering of biologically grounded, dynamically stable neural architectures."}

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one."}

Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too."}

Most assumptions are operationalized by introducing states of the world, conditional on which the decision situation can be analyzed without any remaining uncertainty. Conversely, most classical decision-theoretic approaches are not applicable if the states of the world are inaccessible. We propose a decision model that retains the appeal and simplicity of the original theory, but completely overcomes the need to specify the states of the world explicitly. The main idea of our approach is to address decision problems in a radically empirical way: instead of specifying states and consequences prior to the decision analysis, we only assume a protocol of observed act--consequence pairs as model primitives.

In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point.

Most assumptions are operationalized by introducing states of the world, conditional on which the decision situation can be analyzed without any remaining uncertainty. Conversely, most classical decision-theoretic approaches are not applicable if the states of the world are inaccessible. We propose a decision model that retains the appeal and simplicity of the original theory, but completely overcomes the need to specify the states of the world explicitly. The main idea of our approach is to address decision problems in a radically empirical way: instead of specifying states and consequences prior to the decision analysis, we only assume a protocol of observed act--consequence pairs as model primitives. We show how optimality in such empirical decision problems can be addressed by using protocol-based empirical choice functions and discuss three approaches for deriving inferential guarantees: (I) consistent statistical estimation of choice sets, (II) consistent statistical testing of choice functions with robustness guarantees, and (III) direct inference for empirical choice functions using credal sets.

Our main focus lies on the Lorentzian case, where, motivated by the need to extend classical notions to spaces of low regularity, we provide the first consistent notion of conformal length, and analyse its fundamental properties. We prove that the conformal time separation function $τ_Ω$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $τ_Ω$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes. Moreover, we apply the same methods to the metric case, which is of interest in its own right. This is exemplified by proving an analog of the Nomizu--Ozeki theorem for metric length spaces, which has the advantage that the resulting complete space is conformally related to the original space."}

In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal."}
