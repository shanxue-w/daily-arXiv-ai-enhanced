Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step. We illustrate the achieved benefits using multiple examples."}

That there are primes between squares has been a conjecture in number theory since Legendre. In Spencer-Brown's appendix he gives his proofs of the conjecture. Those proofs are a highly original mixture of standard rigorous arguments and also some stated facts about the way numbers behave that would be considered conjectures by most number theorists. These phenomena are very interesting and constitute a deep observation about the nature of number itself.

Our method matches the complexity guarantees of the standard $p$th-order tensor method that require a known Lipschitz constant, for both convex and nonconvex objectives.

It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error.

However, these systems face challenges such as the random time-varying coding state of the RIS and the difficulty in implementing beamforming in direct modulation. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective joint space-time coding approach for RIS that enables simultaneous realization of both direct modulation communication and beamforming. By modeling the transmitted signals of the RIS using space-time coding, we show that the time coding determines the direct modulation functionality, while the space coding governs the beamforming. Consequently, we introduce a joint time-space coding technique by performing exclusive-or (XOR) operations on the time and space coding sequences, enabling both functionalities to be achieved concurrently. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we design and fabricate a transmissive 1-bit phase reconfigurable RIS operating in the 3.4~3.79 GHz frequency band for the implementation of a direct modulation communication system. Experimental results reveal that the bit error rate (BER) is significantly reduced when joint space-time coding is used, compared to using time coding alone.

One of these is that the Adams operations on its Grothendieck group are trivial. In this paper, we prove three theorems inspired by this. Theorem A states that the Delannoy category is the unique semi-simple pre-Tannakian category having a generator that is fixed by the second Adams operation and whose exterior powers are simple. Theorem B states the Delannoy category is uniquely determined by its Grothendieck semi-ring (among semi-simple pre-Tannakian categories). This is reminiscent of Kazhdan--Wenzl's recognition theorem for quantum $\\mathfrak{gl}_n$, and many subsequent results. Finally, Theorem C establishes some properties of pre-Tannakian categories where the second Adams operation fixes a generator."}

The equation's nonlinear imaginary component introduces rich dynamics and significant computational challenges. We address these challenges using Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. A rigorous stability analysis and a comparative study are performed on three distinct DG schemes : Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG), Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG), and Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG). These methods are compared in terms of their stability and computational efficiency. Our numerical analysis and computational results demonstrate that all three discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are stable. However, the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme proves to be the most robust, as its norm remains bounded even in the presence of nonlinear terms a property not shared by the others. A comparison between the Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG) and Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG) schemes shows that IIPG has superior stability properties. For high values of the penalty parameter, all methods exhibit similar stability behavior. Our results highlight the suitability of DG methods for simulating complex nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems and provide a practical framework for selecting the most efficient scheme for a given problem."}

In 1985, this was proven in seminal work of Scholl and it was recently extended to weakly holomorphic modular forms by Kazalicki and Scholl. We show that Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer type congruences extend to the setting of meromorphic modular forms and that the $p$-adic recurrence relations arise from Scholl's congruences in addition to a contribution of fibers of universal elliptic curves at the poles. Moreover, when the poles are located at CM points, we exploit the CM structure to reduce these $p$-adic recurrence relations to $2$-term relations and we give explicit examples.

In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$."}

Gottschalk famously conjectured that all groups are surjunctive. This remains a central open problem in symbolic dynamics and descriptive set theory. Gromov and Weiss termed the notion of sofic groups, and proved that all such groups are surjunctive, providing the largest class of groups which satisfy Gottschalk's conjecture. It is still open to decide whether all groups are sofic. This became a major open problem in group theory, and is related to other well known problems such as the Aldous--Lyons conjecture in probability theory and to Connes' embedding problem in the theory of operator algebras.\n  A complementary natural question to ask is: Does the reverse implication to Gromov and Weiss' result holds? Namely, are all surjunctive groups sofic? As currently there are no known non-sofic groups, answering this problem in the negative in the category of groups is still out of reach. This paper resolves this problem in the generalized setup of invariant random subgroups of free groups (IRSs), where non (co)sofic objects were recently shown to exist by Lubotzky, Vidick and the two authors. Specifically, we prove that there exists a surjunctive non (co)sofic IRS, resolving the aforementioned problem in the negative. Our proof uses a complexity theoretic approach, and in particular a recent development due to Manzoor, as well as the theory of Rokhlin entropy developed by Seward and others. As a byproduct of our proof technique, the non (co)sofic IRS we provide satisfies a condition stronger than surjunctivity; it satisfies a version of Seward's maximal Rokhlin entropy of Bernoulli Shifts (RBS) criterion."}

Realizing this vision faces two challenges. First, physics-based ray tracing (RT), the standard tool for network planning and coverage modeling, becomes computationally prohibitive for multi-band and multi-directional analysis over large areas. Second, current 5G systems rely on inter-frequency measurement gaps for carrier aggregation and beam management, which reduce throughput, increase latency, and scale poorly as bands and beams proliferate. These limitations motivate a data-driven approach to infer high-frequency characteristics from low-frequency observations. This work proposes CommUNext, a unified deep learning framework for cross-band, multi-directional signal strength (SS) prediction. The framework leverages low-frequency coverage data and crowd-aided partial measurements at the target band to generate high-fidelity FR3 predictions. Two complementary architectures are introduced: Full CommUNext, which substitutes costly RT simulations for large-scale offline modeling, and Partial CommUNext, which reconstructs incomplete low-frequency maps to mitigate measurement gaps in real-time operation. Experimental results show that CommUNext delivers accurate and robust high-frequency SS prediction even with sparse supervision, substantially reducing both simulation and measurement overhead."}

This approach is particularly well-suited for systems involving energy exchange through the boundary, as it is built upon a restricted dual space -- a vector subspace of the topological dual of the configuration space -- that captures information about both the interior dynamics and boundary interactions. Consequently, the resulting dynamical equations naturally incorporate boundary energy flow. In this second part, the theory is extended to encompass vector-bundle-valued differential forms and non-Abelian gauge theories. To account for two commonly used forms of energy flux and boundary power densities, we introduce two distinct but equivalent formulations of the restricted dual. The results are derived from both geometric and variational viewpoints and are illustrated through applications to matter and gauge field theories. The interaction between gauge and matter fields is also addressed, along with the associated boundary conditions, applied to the case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations."}

Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection.

This problem was previously considered by Lamarche, and is closely related to the problem, considered by Dawson, Paré, and Pronk, of \"freely adjoining adjoints\" to a category. We develop a proof-theoretic approach to the problem, beginning with a construction of the free bifibration $Λ_p : \\mathcal{B}\\mathrm{if}(p)\\to C$ in which objects of $\\mathcal{B}\\mathrm{if}(p)$ are formulas of a primitive \"bifibrational logic\", and arrows are derivations in a cut-free sequent calculus modulo a notion of permutation equivalence. We show that instantiating the construction to the identity functor generates a _zigzag double category_ $\\mathbb{Z}(C)$, which is also the free double category with companions and conjoints (or fibrant double category) on $C$. The approach adapts smoothly to the more general task of building $(P,N)$-fibrations, where one only asks for pushforwards along arrows in $P$ and pullbacks along arrows in $N$ for some subsets of arrows, which encompasses Kock and Joyal's notion of _ambifibration_ when $(P,N)$ form a factorization system. We establish a series of progressively stronger normal forms, guided by ideas of _focusing_ from proof theory, and obtain a canonicity result under assumption that the base category is factorization preordered relative to $P$ and $N$. This canonicity result allows us to decide the word problem and to enumerate relative homsets without duplicates. Finally, we describe several examples of a combinatorial nature, including a category of plane trees generated as a free bifibration over $ω$, and a category of increasing forests generated as a free ambifibration over $Δ$, which contains the lattices of noncrossing partitions as quotients of its fibers by the Beck-Chevalley condition."}

This paper introduces contrast bi-forms, a generalisation of contrast functions that systematically encode metric and connection data, allowing for arbitrary affine connections regardless of torsion.

However, a fundamental challenge in their training is the reliance on static loss functions, which may not be optimal across all learning stages. To address this issue, in this paper a hybrid model integrating the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) is proposed which is guided by a Learn-to-Teach (L2T) approach (L2T-DLN). In this framework, the Hyena model is a student, and its loss function is optimized adaptively. A teacher model, leveraging a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN in dynamically balancing the primary cross-entropy loss and a regularization term. Experiments on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset show that our approach significantly improves language modeling performance. Our proposed model achieved a validation Perplexity of 102.6, a notable improvement over the 110.4 achieved by a baseline Hyena model using a static loss function.

In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$."}

The iteration is controlled by three parameters: the dimension K of the simplicial complex, the multiplier m, and the iteration count t. The constructed network is a pure simplicial complex.

AoI is a key metric for evaluating the freshness of status updates in IoT networks, and its optimization is crucial for ensuring the performance of time-critical applications. To facilitate analysis and gain useful insights, we consider a representative scenario, where an IoT device harvests energy from a base station (BS) equipped with a PA and transmits data packets to it. The IoT device harvests energy via the PA until its capacitor is fully charged, then transmits status updates using all stored energy. We derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI by analyzing the capacitor charging time, transmission success probability, and inter-arrival time of successful updates. To minimize the average AoI, we formulate an optimization problem of PA position, and propose a one-dimensional search to solve it. The simulation results show that the optimal PA position is the one closest to the IoT device, and this conclusion can be extended to the multi-IoT devices frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scenario. The PA-based systems significantly outperform the conventional fixed-antenna systems."}

In particular, Bot-Fadili-Nguyen prove weak convergence of discrete accelerated gradient descent (AGD) iterates and, crucially, convergence of the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method in the composite setting, with extensions to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In parallel, Jang-Ryu establish point convergence for the continuous-time accelerated flow and for discrete AGD in finite dimensions.\n  These results leave open which minimizer is selected by the iterates. We answer this in the affine-quadratic setting: when initialized at the same point, the difference between the proximal gradient (PGM) and APG iterates converges weakly to zero. Consequently, APG converges weakly to the best approximation of the initial point in the solution set. Moreover, under mild assumptions on the parameter sequence, we obtain strong convergence of APG. The result is tight: a two-dimensional example shows that coincidence of the APG and PGM limits is specific to the affine-quadratic regime and does not hold in general."}

The desired neural network approximate solution is recursively supplemented by solving a sequence of quasi-minimization problems associated with the underlying loss functionals and the adaptively augmented discontinuous neural network sets without the assumption on the boundedness of the neural network parameters.

We introduce a fractional, PDF-kernel--based framework for plankton--oxygen dynamics and provide general proofs of well-posedness via a generalized Gr\"onwall approach, capturing memory effects that classical integer-order models miss.

This study presents a simulation framework integrating a graph theory-based trip-vehicle matching mechanism with real cruising taxi operations data to simulate ride-hailing services in Chengdu, China. The performances of the two on-demand mobility service modes (i.e., ride-hailing and street-hailing) are evaluated in terms of three key performance indicators: average passenger waiting time (APWT), average deadheading miles (ADM), and average deadheading energy consumption (ADEC). We further examine the impacts of spatiotemporal characteristics and three types of policies: fleet size management, geofencing, and demand management, on the performance of ride-hailing services. Results show that under the same fleet size and trip demand as street-hailing taxis, ride-hailing services without cruising achieve substantial improvements, reducing APWT, ADM, and ADEC by 81\\%, 75\\%, and 72.1\\%, respectively. These improvements are most pronounced during midnight low-demand hours and in remote areas such as airports. Our analysis also reveals that for ride-hailing service, (1) expanding fleet size yields diminishing marginal benefits; (2) geofencing worsens overall performance while it improves the performance of serving all trips within the city center; and (3) demand-side management targeting trips to high-attraction and low-demand areas can effectively reduce passenger waiting time without increasing deadheading costs."}

The data's adaptivity creates significant challenges for frequentist UQ, yet Bayesian UQ remains the same as if the data were independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), making it an appealing and commonly used approach. Bayesian UQ requires the (correct) specification of a prior distribution while frequentist UQ does not, but for i.i.d. data the celebrated Bernstein-von Mises theorem shows that as the sample size grows, the prior 'washes out' and Bayesian UQ becomes frequentist-valid, implying that the choice of prior need not be a major impediment to Bayesian UQ as it makes no difference asymptotically. This paper for the first time extends the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, proving asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian UQ and Wald-type frequentist UQ in this challenging setting. Our result showing this asymptotic agreement does not require the standard stability condition required by works studying validity of Wald-type frequentist UQ; in cases where stability is satisfied, our results combined with these prior studies of frequentist UQ imply frequentist validity of Bayesian UQ. Counterintuitively however, they also provide a negative result that Bayesian UQ is not asymptotically frequentist valid when stability fails, despite the fact that the prior washes out and Bayesian UQ asymptotically matches standard Wald-type frequentist UQ.

When the polynomial is of degree $d$ and all power series are truncated after $n^{th}$ power, we formally arrive into a Hermite interpolation polynomial of degree $d(n+1)-1$. The natural way to represent Hermite interpolation is to have for each interpolation condition a basis polynomial which in this case leads to $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials. We then consider the numerical accumulation of errors in the different ways to represent and evaluate the Hermite interpolation. In the multicentric representation due to the convergence of the power series, numerical errors stay bounded as $n$ grows. When we assume that the piecewise constant holomorphic function takes the value $1$ in one of the components and vanishes in the other so that the Hermite interpolation agrees with just one basis polynomial, even then the truncated multicentric representation is favorable. In the general case one would take a linear combination of all $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials."}

We first establish the regularity properties of the solutions under specific conditions on the input data. A spectral Galerkin method based on Müntz-Jacobi functions is developed that efficiently handle the non-smooth and highly oscillatory solutions. A key advantage of the proposed approach is the ability to compute the approximate solution via recurrence relations, avoiding the need to solve complex algebraic systems. Moreover, the method remains stable even at higher approximation degrees, effectively capturing highly oscillatory solutions with high accuracy. The well-known exponential accuracy is established in the $L^2$-norm, and some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate both the validity of the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."}

Later, we present a generalized result for Dirichlet L-functions by Xiaosheng Wu in 2018, using Levinson's method, showing that more than two-fifths of the non-trivial zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical line. Moreover, more than two-fifths of the non-trivial zeros are simple and on the critical line, using a longer mollifier than in Levinson's original proof. This generalizes a result by Conrey from 1989 that the Riemann zeta-function has at least two-fifths of its zeros on the critical line."}

This discretization technique replaces classical contact formulations and algorithms by introducing a compliant interfacial layer - referred to as the third medium - between the contacting bodies. Unlike traditional contact methods, this formulation naturally accommodates finite deformations at the interface. As the two bodies approach each other, the third medium undergoes compression and effectively acts as a deformable barrier, preventing interpenetration and transmitting contact forces in a smooth and numerically stable manner. In thermo-mechanical problems, heat conduction must be incorporated into the model, which typically requires specialized interface laws when using classical contact formulations. These laws aim to capture the complex thermal behavior at the contact interface, including discontinuities and varying conductance. In contrast, the third medium approach offers a significant advantage: the thermo-mechanical formulation inherently accounts for the interface behavior without the need for additional interface conditions. This includes the gradual heat transfer through the surrounding gas when the bodies are near each other, as well as the localized heat conduction that occurs upon physical contact. As a result, the third medium naturally captures both non-contact and contact-phase thermal conduction within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a new thermo-mechanical model based on a continuum formulation for finite strains and show by means of examples the behaviour of the associated finite element formulation based on linear ansatz functions."}

We consider a simplified forward model, making the problem equivalent to phase retrieval, and propose a discretized regularized variational formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and unfold its iterations into a neural network, where each layer corresponds to one PGA step with learnable parameters. This unrolling approach, inspired by LISTA, enables improved reconstruction quality, interpretability, and implicit dictionary learning from data. We analyze the effect of parameter perturbations and show that they can accumulate exponentially with the number of layers $L$.

If $d_s(a)$ is the depth where a stagnation point appears on the corresponding laminar flow then $d_0(a)<d_s(a)$ for positive $a$ and $d_0(a)>d_s(a)$ for negative $a<-1.01803$. The sign of the second eigenvalue is important in study of subharmonic bifurcations. Another observed property consists of the following: if the sign of the second eigenvalue is positive then the period is increasing along the bifurcation curve in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point, if the sign is negative then the period is decreasing there. We also verify the property of formal stability by a description of the domain in $(a,d)$ variables, where this property holds. Numerical illustrations of these properties are presented in the paper."}

This article provides an extensive review of the literature on digital twins (DTs) and their utilization at the levels of product/production line, production system, and enterprise, and considers how they have been applied under real industrial conditions. This article classifies the types of DTs as well as modeling technologies of DT and applications in different fields, with particular focus on the research of strengths and limitations of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for systems modelling. A generic structure for DT is proposed, outlining the essential components and flow of data. Case studies demonstrate the benefits of DTs for increased efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved lifecycle management, as well as challenges caused by the complexity of data integration and cybersecurity risk, and high implementation costs. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge by identifying both the opportunities and barriers to widespread DT adoption. This study concludes that while DTs offer transformative capabilities for enhancing efficiency and decision-making, overcoming these challenges is crucial for realizing their widespread adoption and impact across service and manufacturing sectors."}

This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint. We express the optimal constellation design as a system of nonlinear equations and establish the conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of its solution. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal modulation parameters using the generalized Lambert function, providing analytical insight into the system's behavior. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the framework to higher-dimensional grids corresponding to multiple channel uses, to non-Gaussian noise models, and to computation over real-valued domains via hybrid digital-analog modulation."}

Additionally, the consistency requirement for phase-field modeling brings difficulties to the construction of nonlinear potentials in the energy functionals, posing significant challenges for classical phase-field modeling and its numerical methods for problems involving many phases. In this work, by adopting a dichotomic approach to represent multiphase, we propose a novel phase-field modeling framework without simplex constraint,in which the free energy is interpolated from the classical two-phase Ginzburg-Landau free energies. We systematically establish the interpolation rules and explicitly construct the interpolation functions, rendering the consistency properties of the model. The proposed model enjoys an energy dissipation property and is shown to be asymptotically consistent with its sharp interface limit, with the Neumann triangle condition recovered at the triple junction.Based on a mobility operator splitting technique, we develop a linear, decoupled, and energy stable scheme for efficiently solving the system of phase-field equations. The numerical stability and accuracy, as well as the consistency properties of the model, are validated through a large number of numerical examples. In particular, the model demonstrates its success in several benchmark simulations for multiphase problems, such as the formation of liquid lenses between two stratified fluids, the generation of double emulsions and Janus emulsions, showing good agreement with experimental observations."}

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems."}

The goal is to construct a collection of narrow confidence intervals, each containing at least one (or exactly one) change, with globally controlled error probability. Our approach relies on a new class of weighted scan statistics, called Hölder-type statistics, which allow a smooth trade-off between efficiency (enabling the detection of closely spaced, small changes) and robustness (against heavier tails and stronger dependence). For Gaussian noise, maximum weighting can be applied, leading to a generalization of optimality results known for scalar, independent data. Even for scalar time series, our approach is advantageous, as it accommodates broad classes of dependency structures and non-stationarity. Its primary advantage, however, lies in its applicability to functional time series, where few methods exist and established procedures impose strong restrictions on the spacing and magnitude of changes. We obtain general results by employing new Gaussian approximations for the partial sum process in Hölder spaces. As an application of our general theory, we consider the detection of distributional changes in a data panel. The finite-sample properties and applications to financial datasets further highlight the merits of our method."}

In this work, we tackle this challenge by addressing the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering the potential function and interaction kernel from discretized observations of the density flow. We formulate the problem as an optimization task that minimizes a loss function specifically designed to enforce the underlying variational structure of Wasserstein flows, ensuring consistency with the geometric properties of the density manifold. Our framework employs a kernel-based operator approach using the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which provides a closed-form representation of the unknown components. Furthermore, a comprehensive error analysis is conducted, providing convergence rates under adaptive regularization parameters as the temporal and spatial discretization mesh sizes tend to zero. Finally, a stability analysis is presented to bridge the gap between discrete trajectory data and continuous-time flow dynamics for the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow."}

Using the time evolution of norm, momentum and energy, or, alternatively, a Lagrangian approach, we develop a Collective-Coordinate-Theory which yields a set of ODEs for our four collective coordinates. These ODEs are solved analytically and numerically for the case of a constant, spatially periodic force $f(x)$. The soliton position exhibits oscillations around a mean trajectory with constant velocity. This means that the soliton performs, on the average, a unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of $f(x)$. In order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum $P(t)$ and soliton velocity $V(t)$: This is a parameter representation of a curve $P(V)$ which is visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE. Moreover, this curve also yields a good estimate for the soliton lifetime: the soliton lives longer, the shorter the branch with negative slope is."}

The integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts is a widely used decomposition algorithm for these problems, relying on optimality cuts generated using subproblems to iteratively refine the master problem. A key computational bottleneck in this approach is solving the mixed-integer subproblems to optimality in order to generate separating cuts. This work proposes a modification to the integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts to allow for efficient generation of no-good optimality cuts that are separating for the current master problem solutions without being supporting hyperplanes of the feasible region. These separating cuts are derived from subproblems that are terminated before the optimal solution is found or proven to be optimal, reducing the computational effort required for cut generation. Additionally, an updated optimality cut generation function is proposed to account for the various complexities introduced by this early termination strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two case studies on industrially relevant problems from the literature, which illustrate its advantages in handling large-scale instances with complex mixed-integer subproblems. In these cases, the method achieves substantial reductions in solution time or optimality gap compared to the standard integer L-shaped method with alternating cuts, with performance improvements that increase with mixed-integer subproblem size and complexity."}

This system can be formally solved for any external force, providing the ratchet velocity as a non-linear functional of the driving force. This allows us to explicitly illustrate the functional Taylor expansion formalism recently proposed for this kind of systems. The Taylor expansion reveals particularly useful to obtain the shape of the current when the force is periodic, piecewise constant. We also illustrate the somewhat counterintuitive effect that introducing damping may induce a ratchet effect. When the force is symmetric under time-reversal and the system is undamped, under symmetry principles no ratchet effect is possible. In this situation increasing damping generates a ratchet current which, upon increasing the damping coefficient eventually reaches a maximum and decreases toward zero. We argue that this effect is not specific of this example and should appear in any ratchet system with tunable damping driven by a time-reversible external force."}

The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS.

Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\\rightarrow\\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations."}

Our algorithm leverages streaming data to recursively track an ensemble of nested subspaces, allowing it to adapt to varying system dimensions without prior knowledge of the true model order. We show that our algorithm is a generalization of the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for Tracking.

The resulting theory of sensitivity is based on the Wasserstein geometry in the same way that the classical theory of variance is based on the Fisher-Rao (equivalently, Hellinger) geometry, and this insight allows us to determine a collection of results which are analogous to the classical case: a Wasserstein-Cramér-Rao lower bound for the sensitivity of any unbiased estimator, a characterization of models in which there exist unbiased estimators achieving the lower bound exactly, and some concrete results that show that the Wasserstein projection estimator achieves the lower bound asymptotically. We use these results to treat many statistical examples, sometimes revealing new optimality properties for existing estimators and other times revealing entirely new estimators."}

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments."}

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets."}

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization."}

Many outpatient clinics have implemented two-stage service systems, with both a physician and physician assistant, to enhance capacity and reduce costs. Some patients only visit a physician assistant while some patients visit both providers depending on their patient type. However, minimizing provider idle time and overtime while reducing patient waiting time is challenging in two-stage service systems. Thus, our objective is to find daily appointment templates, based on block scheduling, that minimize a weighted sum of these metrics. A block schedule divides the overall schedule into several time blocks and assigns patients of different types into each block in proportion to their daily demand to balance the workload throughout the day. Since the problem is shown to be strongly $\\mathcal{NP}$-Hard, we develop a heuristic algorithm that provides a no-idle time appointment template that is easily implementable. We expand our study to include stochastic service times and show that our algorithm yields an efficient block schedule under practically relevant conditions. The algorithm is able to provide a solution similar in cost to the stochastic model when patient wait time costs are low by maintaining lower physician idle times with at most a 16 minute/patient increase in patient wait times. Comparing our heuristic to a First Come, First Appointment scheduling rule, we show that our heuristic is able to better minimize provider idle time, which mimics many real-life settings where clinics prioritize the efficiency of the healthcare providers."}

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability.

In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis."}

In this paper we first review different approaches to obtain multicentric representations with emphasis in piecewise constant holomorphic functions. When the polynomial is of degree $d$ and all power series are truncated after $n^{th}$ power, we formally arrive into a Hermite interpolation polynomial of degree $d(n+1)-1$. The natural way to represent Hermite interpolation is to have for each interpolation condition a basis polynomial which in this case leads to $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials. We then consider the numerical accumulation of errors in the different ways to represent and evaluate the Hermite interpolation. In the multicentric representation due to the convergence of the power series, numerical errors stay bounded as $n$ grows. When we assume that the piecewise constant holomorphic function takes the value $1$ in one of the components and vanishes in the other so that the Hermite interpolation agrees with just one basis polynomial, even then the truncated multicentric representation is favorable. In the general case one would take a linear combination of all $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials."}

In parallel, Jang-Ryu establish point convergence for the continuous-time accelerated flow and for discrete AGD in finite dimensions.\n  These results leave open which minimizer is selected by the iterates. We answer this in the affine-quadratic setting: when initialized at the same point, the difference between the proximal gradient (PGM) and APG iterates converges weakly to zero. Consequently, APG converges weakly to the best approximation of the initial point in the solution set. Moreover, under mild assumptions on the parameter sequence, we obtain strong convergence of APG.

First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion."}

We propose Forecasting Counterfactuals under Stochastic Dynamics (FOCUS), a method that extends traditional matrix completion methods by leveraging time series dynamics of the factors, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of future counterfactuals. Building upon a PCA estimator, our method accommodates both stochastic and deterministic components within the factors, and provides a flexible framework for various applications. In case of stationary autoregressive factors and under standard conditions, we derive error bounds and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks when the latent factors have an autoregressive component. We illustrate FOCUS results on HeartSteps, a mobile health study, illustrating its effectiveness in forecasting step counts for users receiving activity prompts, thereby leveraging temporal patterns in user behavior."}

Our approach relies on local histopolation methods defined through unisolvent triples, where the edge weights are induced by suitable probability densities. In particular, we introduce two new two-parameter families of generalized truncated normal distributions, which extend classical exponential-type laws and provide additional flexibility in capturing local features of the target function. These distributions give rise to new quadratic reconstruction operators that generalize the standard linear histopolation scheme, while retaining its simplicity and locality. We establish their theoretical foundations, proving unisolvency and deriving explicit basis functions, and we demonstrate their improved accuracy through extensive numerical tests. Moreover, we design an algorithm for the optimal selection of the distribution parameters, ensuring robustness and adaptivity of the reconstruction. Finally, we show that the proposed framework naturally extends to any bivariate function whose restriction to the edges defines a valid probability density, thus highlighting its generality and broad applicability."}

For driftless systems with three or more inputs, the available conditions are only sufficient. This paper presents new findings on determining whether a system with m inputs and $2m$ or $2m-1$ states is flat by pure prolongation, a specific subclass of differential flatness. While this condition is more restrictive than general differential flatness, the algorithm for computing flat outputs remains remarkably simple, and the verification requirements are relatively lenient.

However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications."}

In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method."}

This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature.

I review historically how the simple idea of marrying a Riemannian manifold to a two point space, progressed to lead to the uniqueness of the Standard Model and beyond. I explain how inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator reconstruct the full gauge-Higgs sector of the Standard Model on an almost-commutative space, fixing representations and hypercharges and naturally accommodating right-handed neutrinos and the see-saw mechanism. On the gravitational side, the heat-kernel expansion of the spectral action yields the cosmological constant, Einstein--Hilbert term, and higher-curvature corrections, with volume-quantized variants clarifying the status of $Λ$. I discuss the renormalization-group interpretation of the spectral action as a high-scale boundary condition, phenomenological implications for Higgs stability and neutrino masses. I present generalized Heisenberg equation leading to identify the NCG space at unification. I conclude by emphasizing that NCG provides a unified, testable, and geometrically principled quantum framework, linking matter, gauge fields, and gravity."}

This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces."}

We consider a simplified forward model, making the problem equivalent to phase retrieval, and propose a discretized regularized variational formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and unfold its iterations into a neural network, where each layer corresponds to one PGA step with learnable parameters. This unrolling approach, inspired by LISTA, enables improved reconstruction quality, interpretability, and implicit dictionary learning from data. We analyze the effect of parameter perturbations and show that they can accumulate exponentially with the number of layers $L$.

All constructions are based on integral functionals defined by suitable probability densities and orthogonal polynomials within quadratic trial spaces. We provide a comprehensive analysis that establishes unisolvence and derives necessary and sufficient conditions on the densities to guarantee well-posedness. Representative density families, including two-parameter symmetric Dirichlet laws and convexly blended volumetric families, are examined in detail, and a general procedure for constructing the associated quadratic basis functions is outlined.

Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance. These results bridge theory and practice, providing convergence guarantees and practical guidance for large-scale imaging problems."}

By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric.

We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \\cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget.

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization.

Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems."}

Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication.

We formulate the problem as an optimization task that minimizes a loss function specifically designed to enforce the underlying variational structure of Wasserstein flows, ensuring consistency with the geometric properties of the density manifold.

However, recent studies indicate that the inherent structure of MMD may constrain its ability to distinguish between distributions, leaving room for improvement. Regularization techniques have the potential to overcome this limitation by refining the discrepancy measure. In this paper, we introduce a family of regularized kernel-based discrepancy measures constructed via spectral filtering. Our framework can be regarded as a natural generalization of prior studies, removing restrictive assumptions on both kernel functions and filter functions, thereby broadening the methodological scope and the theoretical inclusiveness. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees showing that the resulting tests achieve valid Type~I error control and enhanced power performance.

This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics."}

SSOS tensors are defined as SOS tensors with a positive definite Gram matrix, ensuring structural stability under perturbations. The SOS$^*$ cone is defined as the dual cone of the SOS tensor cone, with characterizations via moment matrices and polynomial nonnegativity. We study the relations among completely positive (CP) cones, CD cones, sum of squares (SOS) cones, positive semidefinite (PSD) cones and copositive (COP) cones.

The robust confidence interval estimators accommodate substantial heterogeneity in both regressors and noise.

In this paper, we study the cage problem and several of its variants from a computational perspective. Four complementary graph generation algorithms are developed based on exhaustive generation of lifts, a tabu search heuristic, a hill climbing heuristic and excision techniques. Using these methods, we establish new upper bounds for eleven cases of the classical cage problem: $n(3,16) \\leq 936$, $n(3,17) \\leq 2048$, $n(4,9) \\leq 270$, $n(4,10) \\leq 320$, $n(4,11) \\leq 713$, $n(5,9) \\leq 1116$, $n(6,11) \\leq 7783$, $n(8,7) \\leq 774$, $n(10,7) \\leq 1608$, $n(12,7) \\leq 2890$ and $n(14,7) \\leq 4716$.

We focus on the small-Biot-number regime. The problem is accurately described by the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) formulation, which couples the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid with the heat equation in the solid through interfacial continuity conditions. Because full CHT simulations are computationally expensive, simplified models are often used in practice. Starting from the coupled equations, we systematically reduce the formulation to the lumped-capacitance model, a single ordinary differential equation with a closed-form solution, based on two assumptions: time scale separation and a spatially uniform solid temperature. The total modeling error is decomposed into time homogenization and lumping contributions. We derive an asymptotic error bound for the lumping error, valid for general heterogeneous solids and spatially varying heat transfer coefficients. Building on this theoretical result, we introduce a computable upper bound expressed in measurable quantities for practical evaluation. Time scale separation is analyzed theoretically and supported by physical arguments and simulations, showing that large separation yields small time homogenization errors. In practice, the Biot number must be estimated from so-called empirical correlations, which are typically limited to specific canonical geometries. We propose a data-driven framework that extends empirical correlations to a broader range of geometries through learned characteristic length scales. All results are validated by direct numerical simulations up to Reynolds numbers of 10,000."}

In systems and control theory, it provides key insights into the internal structure of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and is closely linked to properties such as passivity, relaxation, and time-reversibility. This paper extends the concept of reciprocity to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems, a class of infinite-dimensional systems with spatio-temporal dynamics. It is suggested that, analogously to the LTI case, combining the internal properties of reciprocity and (impedance) passivity entails physical state-space realizations. This is of particular relevance for infinite-dimensional systems, where issues of unboundedness can be detrimental to the well-posedness of the system.

We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $τ\\subsetneq σ$ for which $|τ| = i$ and $|σ| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long."}

This family of problems consists of games between two players: the leader and the follower. There is a market that is partitioned into two parts: the part of the leader and the part of the leader's competitors. The leader controls one part of the market and can freely set the prices for products. By contrast, the prices of the competitors' products are fixed and known in advance. The follower, then, needs to solve a combinatorial optimization problem in order to satisfy their own demands, while comparing the leader's offers to the offers of the competitors. Therefore, the leader has to hit the intricate balance of making an attractive offer to the follower, while at the same time ensuring that their own profit is maximized.\n  Pferschy, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Schauer considered the Stackelberg pricing game where the follower solves a knapsack problem. They raised the question whether this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $Σ^p_2$-complete. The same conjecture was also made by Böhnlein, Schaudt, and Schauer. In this paper, we positively settle this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this result holds actually in a much broader context: The Stackelberg pricing game is $Σ^p_2$-complete for over 50 NP-complete problems, including most classics such as TSP, vertex cover, clique, subset sum, etc. This result falls in line of recent meta-theorems about higher complexity in the polynomial hierarchy by Grüne and Wulf."}

The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \\neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification.

The effectiveness of such approach is proven by reproducing biologically relevant results like the formation of propagating invasion fronts and the emergence of an interstitial gap between normal and cancerous cells, which is driven by the pH lowering strategy and depends significantly on the non-homogenous diffusion rates.

We introduce a SAT-based alternative that encodes fibers as Boolean circuits which allows modern SAT samplers to generate tables randomly. We analyze the sampling bias that SAT samplers may introduce, provide diagnostics, and propose practical mitigation. We propose hybrid MCMC schemes that combine SAT proposals with local moves to ensure correct stationary distributions which do not necessarily require connectivity via local moves which is particularly beneficial in presence of structural zeros. Across benchmarks, including small and involved tables with many structural zeros where pure Markov-basis methods underperform, our methods deliver reliable conditional p-values and often outperform samplers that rely on precomputed Markov bases."}

In order to cope with the uncertainty of recycling quantity and the demand of mixed-model disassembly of multiple vehicle types, this paper designs a multi-parallel mixed-model disassembly line (MPMDL), and constructs a corresponding mixed-integer planning model for the equilibrium optimization problem of this disassembly line with the optimization objectives of the minimum number of workstations, the minimum fatigue level of workers and the minimum energy consumption. Combining the differences in disassembly processes between fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles, an improved non-dominated sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) based on the distribution of feasible solutions and dynamic search resource allocation is designed to solve this multi-objective dynamic balance optimization problem, and the two-stage dynamic adjustment strategy is adopted to realize the adaptive adjustment of the disassembly line under the uncertainty of the recycling quantity, and, recently, arithmetic validation is carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the resource utilization efficiency, reduce energy consumption, alleviate the workers' load, and provide multiple high-quality disassembly solutions under the multi-objective trade-off. Compared with mainstream multi-objective optimization algorithms, the INSGA-III algorithm shows significant advantages in terms of solution quality, convergence and stability.

This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements."}

Perhaps surprisingly, as $r$ grows without bound, the hand ranking is not stable until $r=761$ (a 3044 card deck). We consider showdown frequency, which is the frequency that a given type of hand is declared by a player at showdown, and make note of counterintuitive instances in which a hand with lower absolute frequency than some other hand nonetheless has a higher showdown frequency.

However, we take a network approach, modeling the contractor network as a directed graph where nodes represent contractors and project owners and edges represent contractual obligations with associated financial records. To understand risk propagation throughout the contractor network, we extend the celebrated Friedkin-Johnsen model and introduce a stochastic process to simulate principal failures across the network.

This family of problems consists of games between two players: the leader and the follower. There is a market that is partitioned into two parts: the part of the leader and the part of the leader's competitors. The leader controls one part of the market and can freely set the prices for products. By contrast, the prices of the competitors' products are fixed and known in advance. The follower, then, needs to solve a combinatorial optimization problem in order to satisfy their own demands, while comparing the leader's offers to the offers of the competitors. Therefore, the leader has to hit the intricate balance of making an attractive offer to the follower, while at the same time ensuring that their own profit is maximized.\n  Pferschy, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Schauer considered the Stackelberg pricing game where the follower solves a knapsack problem. They raised the question whether this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $Σ^p_2$-complete. The same conjecture was also made by Böhnlein, Schaudt, and Schauer. In this paper, we positively settle this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this result holds actually in a much broader context: The Stackelberg pricing game is $Σ^p_2$-complete for over 50 NP-complete problems, including most classics such as TSP, vertex cover, clique, subset sum, etc. This result falls in line of recent meta-theorems about higher complexity in the polynomial hierarchy by Grüne and Wulf."}

Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection. Altogether, this framework provides a quantitative understanding of the trade-off between generative capacity and imitation fidelity, bridging rigorous analysis and model design within a unified mathematical perspective."}

As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment."}

The time scale is continuous. Particles of different types arrive to the utmost left and the utmost right site.

If a particle is either in the utmost left site or the utmost right site, then the particle leaves the system or moves onto one cell to the right or to the left, respectively. An arrival or a transfer of particle is possible only to a vacant site. The rate of arrival, exit or movement of a particle depends on its type and does not depend on the site from that the particle arrives or exits and on the direction the movement. The stationary distribution of the system states probabilities has been found. This distribution turns out to be multiplicative in the sense that the probability of the site state does not depend on the states of the other sites in the stationary mode, and the steady probability of any state of the system is equal to the product of the site states steady probabilities, and the probability of site ocupancy is the same as the server occupancy probability for M/G/1/0 loss system.

A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $Ω(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw. The resulting analysis establishes a formally verified version of Chazelle's implementation and confirms its quadratic time complexity."}

Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation."}

Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \\geq \\frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.\n  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p> 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p > 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems."}

To the best of our knowledge, the SBP in such a setting has not been previously studied.\n  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of the SBP solution $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}$ in the regime-switching jump-diffusion setting. In particular, we show that $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}$ is again a path measure of a regime-switching jump diffusion; under proper assumptions, we establish various properties of $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}$ from both a stochastic calculus perspective and an analytic viewpoint.

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirements", "summary": "Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \\geq \\frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.\n  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p> 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p > 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems."}

Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies."}

The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster."}

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration."}

Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results."}

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments."}

In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality.

Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability.

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage.

We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT.

In this paper we are interested in a quantity which represents the instability of an estimator when its value is compared to the value for an infinitesimal additive perturbation of the original data set; we refer to this as the \"sensitivity\" of an estimator. The resulting theory of sensitivity is based on the Wasserstein geometry in the same way that the classical theory of variance is based on the Fisher-Rao (equivalently, Hellinger) geometry, and this insight allows us to determine a collection of results which are analogous to the classical case: a Wasserstein-Cramér-Rao lower bound for the sensitivity of any unbiased estimator, a characterization of models in which there exist unbiased estimators achieving the lower bound exactly, and some concrete results that show that the Wasserstein projection estimator achieves the lower bound asymptotically. We use these results to treat many statistical examples, sometimes revealing new optimality properties for existing estimators and other times revealing entirely new estimators."}
