The NSFR scheme has been successfully applied to unsteady\ncompressible flows. Through the use of a bound-preserving limiter, positivity\nof thermodynamic quantities is preserved, and this enables the extension of\nNSFR to hyperbolic conservation laws. We extend the limiter of Zhang and Shu\n[1] to ensure robustness for the proposed scheme. The limiter is modified to\nconsider the minimum density and pressure at the solution nodes when\ndetermining the value to scale the solution. The modifications are thoroughly\ntested with a suite of test cases. In addition to these modifications, this\npaper conducts a thorough investigation into the shock-capturing capabilities\nof the NSFR scheme and the advantages it presents over standard discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) methods, where, on select variants of the flux reconstruction\n(FR) scheme, essentially oscillation-free solutions are demonstrated. Various\nparameters of the scheme are extensively tested and analyzed through several 1D\nand 2D compressible Euler tests that verify the high-order accuracy, entropy\nstability, time step advantage and shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR\nscheme. These parameters include the two-point flux, quadrature nodes and the\nstrength of the FR parameter. In addition to investigating the impact of the\nvarious two-point fluxes, this paper also presents numerical studies to\ndetermine the CFL condition required to maintain positivity for the two-point\nflux of choice. The investigation yields insightful results for all parameters,\nwith the results pertaining to the type of FR scheme being of special interest.\nThe tests showcase increased robustness, time step advantages and\noscillation/overshoot mitigation when employing a stronger FR parameter."}

A core emphasis of this model\nis its direct integration of density-dependent elastic moduli, offering a more\nphysically realistic representation of engineering materials where intrinsic\nporosity and density profoundly influence mechanical behavior. The governing\nboundary value problem, formulated for the static equilibrium of a 3-D,\nhomogeneous, and isotropic material, manifests as a system of second-order,\nquasilinear partial differential equations. This system is meticulously coupled\nwith classical traction-free boundary conditions imposed at the complex crack\nsurface. For the robust numerical solution of this intricate nonlinear problem,\nwe employ a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element discretization.\nThe inherent strong nonlinearities arising within the discrete system are\neffectively managed through a powerful and stable {Picard-type linearization\nscheme}. The proposed model demonstrates a remarkable ability to accurately\ndescribe the full stress and strain states in a diverse range of materials,\ncrucially recovering the well-established classical singularities observed in\nlinearized elastic fracture mechanics. A comprehensive numerical examination of\ntensile stress, strain, and strain energy density fields consistently reveals\nthat these quantities attain their peak values in the immediate vicinity of the\ncrack tip, an observation that remarkably aligns with established findings in\nstandard linearized elastic fracture mechanics."}

The\nconvex hull of pedigrees is called the pedigree polytope for $n$. Pedigrees are\nin $1-1$ correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles. Properties of pedigrees,\npedigree polytopes, adjacency structure of the graph of the pedigree polytope\nand their implication on the adjacency structure of the Symmetric Travelling\nSalesman problem (STSP) polytope have been studied earlier in the literature by\nthe author.\n  The question: Given $X$, does it belong to the pedigree polytope for $n$? is\ncalled the membership problem. This article provides proof that the membership\nproblem for pedigree polytopes can be solved efficiently. Due to the pedigree's\nstem property, we can check the membership problem sequentially for $ k \\in [4,\nn]$. One constructs a layered network, recursively, to check membership in the\npedigree polytope. Proof of the proposed framework's validity is given. This\narticle's significant and far-reaching contribution is that the membership\nproblem has a strongly polynomial-time framework.\n  Since the polynomial solvability of the membership problem implies that one\ncan solve efficiently any linear optimisation problem over the pedigree\npolytope. And a specific linear optimisation over the pedigree polytope (the\nmultistage insertion formulation) solves the STSP.\n  The consequence of this result is that we have proof of $NP = P$. A recent\nbook by the author entitled \\textit{Pedigree Polytopes} brings together\npublished results on pedigrees and some new results, mainly in Chapters 5 and\n6. The primary purpose of this article is to present the latest results from\nthat book in a self-contained fashion so that experts can vet the same.

The proposed method\nutilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized\nand well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus\ntensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy\nof functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus\ntensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations\nby symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully\nautomated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods\nsuch as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We\ndemonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus\ntensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure\ntensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes.\nFurthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural\nnetwork models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning\nthe symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given\nstress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the\nstress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of\nuniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in\nmodel selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a\nselected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for\na given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common\norder in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function\nrepresentation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data."}

A difficulty in areas such as genomics, where the\nnumber of candidate variables is vast, arises from the need for preliminary\nreduction prior to the assessment of models. The present paper considers a\nresolution using inferential separations fundamental to the Fisherian approach\nto conditional inference, namely, the sufficiency/co-sufficiency separation,\nand the ancillary/co-ancillary separation. The advantage of these separations\nis that no direction for departure from any hypothesised model is needed,\navoiding issues that would otherwise arise from using the same data for\nreduction and for model assessment. In idealised cases with no nuisance\nparameters, the separations extract all the information in the data, solely for\nthe purpose for which it is useful, without loss or redundancy. The extent to\nwhich estimation of nuisance parameters affects the idealised information\nextraction is illustrated in detail for the normal-theory linear regression\nmodel, extending immediately to a log-normal accelerated-life model for\ntime-to-event outcomes. This idealised analysis provides insight into when\nsample-splitting is likely to perform as well as, or better than, the\nco-sufficient or ancillary tests, and when it may be unreliable.

This is the first tutorial\narticle to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation\nexposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin\nby discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE\n802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical\nlayer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by\nover 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been\nenhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include\ncapabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access.\nFourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and\nintroduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile,\nbattery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the\ngenerations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate\nspectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput,\nreliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access\nPoints to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency.

To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique\nbased on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the\nERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the\nmethod developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of\nsubgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count.

We are able to circumvent this problem for some important ecological\nmodels by noticing that the per-capita growth rates at stationarity are zero,\nsomething which can sometimes yield information about the invariant probability\nmeasure. For more complicated models we use a recent result by Cuello to\nexplore how small noise influences the population size. We are able to show\nthat environmental fluctuations can decrease, increase, or leave unchanged the\nexpected population size. The results change according to the dynamical model\nand, within a fixed model, also according to which parameters (growth rate,\ncarrying capacity, etc) are affected by environmental fluctuations.

Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:\ndefining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.\nWe argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as\nimplicitly approximating information divergences for this projection.

This\ncan be regarded as the first rigorous justification of the Parametric\nSubharmonic Instability (PSI) of inviscid internal waves, wherein energy is\ntransferred from an initially excited primary wave to two secondary waves with\ndifferent frequencies. Our approach uses Floquet-Bloch decomposition and Kato's\nsimilarity transformations to compute rigorously the perturbed eigenvalues\nwithout requiring boundedness of the perturbed operator - differing\nfundamentally from prior analyses involving viscosity.\n  Notably, the inviscid setting is especially relevant in oceanographic\napplications, where viscous effects are often negligible."}

These equations model the\nproduction dynamics of a protein species by a single cell, where a feedback\nmechanism downregulates the protein's production. Furthermore, we analyze the\nstability of a non-trivial steady-state solution and provide sufficient\nconditions on the nonlinearity parameter, boundary flux, and time delay that\nensure the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation."}
