To address the nonlinearity and severe ill-posedness\nof this phaseless inverse scattering problem, we introduce a robust, globally\nconvergent numerical framework combining several key regularization strategies.\nOur method first employs a phase retrieval step based on the\nWentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) ansatz, where the lost phase information is\nreconstructed by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, we\nimplement a Fourier-based dimension reduction technique, transforming the\noriginal problem into a more stable system of elliptic equations with Cauchy\nboundary conditions. To solve this resulting system reliably, we apply the\nCarleman convexification approach, constructing a strictly convex weighted cost\nfunctional whose global minimizer provides an accurate approximation of the\ntrue solution. Numerical simulations using synthetic data with high noise\nlevels demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method,\nconfirming its capability to accurately recover both the geometric location and\ncontrast of hidden scatterers."}

A functional analysis attempt to solve this type of boundary\ncondition is not straight forward since results about existence and uniqueness\nof solution are still limited. Hence, a semi analytical method is described\nhere to approach a solution. A perturbation solution around the monopole\nconverts the nonlinear oblique problem into a series of known Neumann problems\nin the exterior of the sphere. The corresponding Green's function\nrepresentation for the exterior Neumann problem gives an exact analytic\nsolution for each perturbation step as an integral on the surface of the\nsphere.

The perturbation solutions given by\nintegrals of the Green's function on the sphere are computed at each\nperturbation step using different subdivisions of the surface integrals with\nthe help of adaptive quadrature method.

This paper introduces a novel\nnetworking paradigm, termed heterogeneous massive MIMO (HmMIMO), which\nseamlessly integrates co-located and distributed antennas. Differing from two\nconventional paradigms, HmMIMO remains a base station with a large antenna\narray at the center of each cell, aided by distributed antennas deployed at\ncell edges.

First, we provide an approximation of the noncommutative integral for\nspectrally truncated spectral triples in the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of\noperator system spectral triples. Our approximation has a close link to Quantum\nErgodicity, which we will use to state an NCG analogue of the fundamental\nresult that ergodic geodesic flow implies quantum ergodicity.

Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to\nconjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by\nKumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras.

However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery\nprocedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short\npackets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication\nefficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can\nbackfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under\nlonger blocklengths.

In such\nsystems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a\nfinitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Z}[t^\\pm]$\nequipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of\nremote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with\nanother planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability,\nwe observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to\npropose the $\\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of\ngapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires\nthat every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in\nthe normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We\nprove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of\nexcitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To\njustify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon\ntheory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a\ntransverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and\nonly if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector\nprinciple gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we\nconjecture is also sufficient.

However, the requirement that an outsider be preferred to every\nmember of the set can be overly restrictive and difficult to justify in many\napplications. Motivated by this, we introduce a more flexible notion: $(t,\n\\alpha)$-undominated sets. Here, each voter compares an outsider to their\n$t$-th most preferred member of the set, and the set is undominated if no\noutsider is preferred by more than an $\\alpha$-fraction of voters.

Additionally, we identify a novel\n''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives\ntipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included.\nThese transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem\ntransitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical\nand empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent\ntipping or drive collapse."}

Since the interplay\nbetween forcing wavenumber and intrinsic wavenumber crucially shapes the\nspectrum and emerging patterns, we distinguish between resonant and\nnon-resonant regimes. Extending earlier work that assumed asymptotically small\ncoefficients, we tackle the more involved onset analysis produced by O(1)\nforcing and work directly in Bloch space, where the richer structure of the\nbifurcating solutions becomes apparent. This abstract framework is readily\ntransferable to more complex systems, such as reaction-diffusion equations\narising as dryland vegetation models, where topography induces spatial\nheterogeneity."}

The problem is\nparticularly challenging due to the presence of memory integrals and delayed\nstates, which necessitate strengthening the classical controllability\nrequirement to ensure complete rest at the final time. To address this, we\nadopt the notion of Delay and memory-type null controllability, which demands\nthe vanishing of the state, the accumulated memory term, and the influence of\ndelay at the terminal time. Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the\ncontrollability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the\ncorresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and\nestablish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights\nare then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and\nmemory terms. By leveraging Carleman estimates and time-dependent control\nstrategies, we derive sufficient conditions under which controllability can be\nachieved. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate\nthe critical role of moving control regions in neutralizing the effects of\nmemory and delay."}

First, we\npresent a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a\nsingle curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we\ndetail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for\nnumerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's\nproblem are found."}
