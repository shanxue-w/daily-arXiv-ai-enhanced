Our second and main contribution is a decomposition\nframework that alternates optimization between two subproblems: one involving\nonly continuous variables and the other involving only binary variables. For\npolynomial kernels, we show that the binary subproblem reduces to a submodular\nfunction maximization under a cardinality constraint, enabling the use of\nscalable submodular maximization algorithms within the alternating optimization\nprocess. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms significantly\noutperform standard methods for solving the proposed MINLPs, providing more\neffective solutions to the addressed feature selection problem."}

What distinguishes the various regimes is the scaling of\nthe stretching energy $\\sim \\varepsilon^{2\\beta}$, with $\\beta$ a positive\nnumber. We derive two one-dimensional models as $\\beta$ ranges in $(0, 2]$.\nRemarkably, boundary conditions are essential to get compactness.\n  We show that for $\\beta \\in (0, 2)$ the $\\Gamma$-limit leads to relaxation:\nthe limit membrane energy vanishes on compression. For $\\beta=2$ there is no\nrelaxation, and the limit model is a nonlinear energy coupling four kinematical\ndescriptors in a nontrivial way.\n  As special cases of the latter limit model, a nonlinear Vlasov torsion theory\nand a nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory can be deduced."}

Due to the\nill-posedness of such problems, we employ regularization methods to stabilize\nsolutions. While singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a classical\napproach, its computation can be costly and impractical for certain operators.\nWe explore alternatives via Diagonal Frame Decomposition (DFD), generalizing\nSVD-based techniques, and introduce a regularized solution $x^\\delta_\\alpha =\n\\sum_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\kappa_\\lambda g_\\alpha(\\kappa_\\lambda^2) \\langle\ny^\\delta, v_\\lambda \\rangle \\overline{u}_\\lambda$.
