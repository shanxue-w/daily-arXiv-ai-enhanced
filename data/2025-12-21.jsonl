Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm."}

We investigate the perfect reconstruction property of these filter banks and analyze their robustness against erasures for discrete-time signals in a finite-dimensional space $\\mathbb C^N$ . The study is further extended to non-uniform Ramanujan filter banks, showcasing their ability to address the limitations of uniform ones. Employing the reconstruction properties of uniform Ramanujan filter banks, we present an uncertainty principle associated with a tight frame of shifts of Ramanujan sums. This principle establishes representation inequalities in terms of Euler's totient function that provide sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of signals in scenarios where signal information is lost during transmission or corrupted by noise. Finally, we illustrate that utilizing the signal's periodicity information through Ramanujan filter banks significantly improves the efficiency of signal recovery optimization algorithms, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains and more precise reconstruction."}

This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications."}

However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation."}

First, we introduce n-adjoints, a hierarchy of generalized adjoint operations that extend classical adjoints to multicategorical settings and capture higher-order operator interactions. We prove a multicategorical version of Stinespring's theorem formulated in terms of n-adjoints. Second, we study the algebraic semantics of quantum processes and show that completely positive trace-preserving maps admit a canonical monadic description. In particular, we prove a monadicity theorem identifying quantum processes, up to operadic operational equivalence, with algebras of a synergy monad induced by a symmetric quantum interaction operad, yielding a faithful representation that uniformly accounts for sequential and parallel composition. Third, we present an algebraic formulation of quantum no-go principles by encoding constraints such as the no-cloning theorem as operadic ideals. Together, these results provide a coherent algebraic framework that unifies operator theory, category theory, and quantum information."}

They exhibit a variety of algebraic and geometric properties which are classical in the case of their continuous counterparts. In a special case, it is demonstrated that the diagonals of the quadrilaterals of these discrete ellipsoids form two families of closed planar polygons. These polygons may be regarded as the discrete analogues of the classical circular cross sections of an ellipsoid. As in the continuous case, the discrete circles of any family lie in parallel planes and degenerate at the ``boundary'' of the discrete ellipsoids to ``umbilic vertices'' or ``umbilic edges''.

A fundamental parameter (\"alpha\") in the derivation is the distance from the endpoint of the range of integration to the first node, measured inward in step-lengths. Setting alpha to 1/2 yields a set of corrected composite midpoint rules. Setting alpha=0 yields Gregory's closed Newton-Cotes-like rules, including (for sufficient overlap) the standard closed Newton-Cotes rules (trapezoidal rule, \"1/3 Simpson rule\", \"3/8 Simpson rule\", \"Boole's rule\", etc.). Setting alpha=1 yields open N-C-like rules, again including the standard ones.

Our principal result is a quantitative stability theorem: if a state has entropy within epsilon of the minimum possible value under a fixed block constraint, then it must lie within O(epsilon^{1/2}) in trace norm of the manifold of entropy minimizers. We show that this rate is optimal. The analysis is entirely finite-dimensional and relies on a precise decomposition of entropy into classical and internal components, together with sharp relative entropy inequalities. As an application, we study finite additive operators whose spectral decomposition induces natural block constraints. In this setting, the stability theorem yields quantitative non-concentration bounds for induced spectral measures. The framework is abstract and independent of arithmetic input.

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes."}

We link prediction-powered inference with empirical likelihood by stacking supervised estimating equations based on labeled outcomes with auxiliary moment conditions built from predictions, and then optimizing empirical likelihood under these joint constraints. The resulting empirical likelihood-based prediction-powered inference (EPI) estimator is asymptotically normal, has asymptotic variance no larger than the fully supervised estimator, and attains the semiparametric efficiency bound when the auxiliary functions span the predictable component of the supervised score. For hypothesis testing and confidence sets, empirical likelihood ratio statistics admit chi-squared-type limiting distributions. As a by-product, the empirical likelihood weights induce a calibrated empirical distribution that integrates supervised and prediction-based information, enabling estimation and uncertainty quantification for general functionals beyond parameters defined by estimating equations. We present two practical implementations: one based on basis expansions in the predictions and covariates, and one that learns an approximately optimal auxiliary function by cross-fitting. In simulations and applications, EPI reduces mean squared error and shortens confidence intervals while maintaining nominal coverage."}

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist."}

Welcome all comments!", "summary": "In this article, we initiate the study of the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional relativistic Euler equations in a low-regularity setting. By introducing good variables--a rescaled velocity, logarithmic enthalpy, and an appropriately defined vorticity, we reformulate the equations into a coupled wave-transport system.\n  First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions when the initial logarithmic enthalpy $h_0$, rescaled velocity $\\bv_0$, and vorticity $\\bw_0$ satisfy $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. By using Strichartz estimates and semiclassical analysis, a relaxed well-posedness result holds when $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. Both results are valid for the general state function $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho^A$ ($A \\geq 1$).\n  Secondly, in the special case where $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho$, the acoustic metric reduces to the standard flat Minkowski metric. We can establish the well-posedness of solutions when $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{w}_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. The regularity exponents for the log-enthalpy and rescaled velocity correspond to those in Smith and Tataru \\cite{ST}, while the vorticity regularity corresponds to Bourgain and Li \\cite{BL}. Moreover, if the stiff flow is irrotational, we can prove the local well-posedness for $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0) \\in H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, and global well-posedness for small initial data $(h_0, \\bv_0) \\in \\dot{B}^{1}_{2,1}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$."}

We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case.

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR."}

Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\\Pr_{D}[E] \\ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $β$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $β$?\n  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(β^{γd})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $β$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass for any $γ< α$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality.

In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."}

Their implementation, however, suffered a significant drawback: GCs were approximated from models based on discrete-time stroboscopic sampling of local VOU processes, which is not only computationally inefficient, but more seriously, unfeasible on regions of phase space where local dynamics are unstable, leaving \"holes\" in the GC maps. We solve these problems by deriving an analytical expression for GC rates associated with a VOU process which, under quite general conditions, yields a meaningful solution even in the unstable case. Applied to GC maps, this not only \"fills in the holes\", but also furnishes a computationally efficient method of calculation devolving to solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations which, in the case of a univariate source, become simple quadratic equations. We show, furthermore, that the GC rate for VOU processes is invariant under rescaling of the overall fluctuations intensity, so that GC maps may effectively be calculated for deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, with a residual \"ghost of noise\" represented by a variance-covariance map."}

Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods.

This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold.

Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex. In several cases, discrepancies arise between the existing discrete-time results, namely those obtained for momentum algorithms, and their continuous-time counterparts, with the latter typically yielding stronger guarantees. We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions. Adapting continuous-time results that have weaker discrete equivalents to the continuized method, we improve by a constant factor the known convergence rate, and relax the existing assumptions on the set of minimizers."}

Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution.

In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks."}

The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices.

On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenböck torsion plays a crucial rôle. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories."}

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."}

Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check\" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds.

In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution.

While numerous natural candidates for efficient rules have been eliminated, all existing lower bound constructions are tailored to individual or small sets of pivot rules. We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \\emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value. Both results carry over to the simplex method for linear programming."}

The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \\geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation."}

In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution.

While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics."}

The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers.

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing \"traditional\" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption."}

By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions."}

Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is almost never a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically energetically suboptimal. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM."}

We prove this conjecture unconditionally.\n  Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $ρ_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{μμ} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.\n  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization."}

Main result is the proof that $\\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$.

Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras.

After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum.
