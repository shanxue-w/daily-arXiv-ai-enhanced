However,\nensuring their stability -- particularly at high orders -- remains a practical\nand theoretical challenge. In this work, we address this gap by developing a\ndiscrete counterpart to the recent well-posedness analysis of Kopriva, Gassner,\nand Nordstr\\\"om for continuous overset domain initial-boundary-value problems.\nTo this end, we introduce the novel concept of sub-cell summation-by-parts\n(SBP) operators. These discrete derivative operators mimic integration by parts\nat a sub-cell level. By exploiting this sub-cell SBP property, we develop\nprovably conservative and energy-stable overset grid methods, thereby resolving\nlongstanding stability issues in the field."}

Its virtues lie in protection against partial nuisance\nmisspecification and asymptotic semiparametric efficiency under correct\nnuisance specification.

In\nfact, it has been amply verified empirically that these estimators can perform\npoorly when all nuisance functions are misspecified. Here, we first\ncharacterize this phenomenon of double fragility, and then propose a solution\nbased on adaptive correction clipping (ACC). We argue that our ACC proposal is\nsafe, in that it inherits the favorable properties of doubly robust estimators\nunder correct nuisance specification, but its error is guaranteed to be bounded\nby a convex combination of the individual nuisance model errors, which prevents\nthe instability caused by the compounding product of errors of doubly robust\nestimators.

The\nmodel jointly optimizes dynamic satellites location, vehicle routing, and\ncustomer delivery modes, explicitly accounting for (i) heterogeneous customer\ntravel behaviors, (ii) heterogeneous fleet composition, and (iii) diverse\nemission profiles across both echelons. A piecewise linear formulation captures\nthe additional emissions from first-echelon vehicle stops, while customer\ntravel emissions are computed based on individual willingness and capacity to\nuse zero-emission transport. The problem is solved exactly for a wide set of\nreal-world-based instances under four operational strategies, differing in\noptimization objectives and second-echelon fleet composition. Computational\nexperiments, including a case study with a major Portuguese LMD provider,\nhighlight the environmental and operational tradeoffs inherent to strategic and\noperational choices such as fleet composition, satellite activation, and\ncustomer pick-up policies. Results reveal that minimizing distance can lead to\nsubstantial increases in emissions, while emissions-oriented strategies\nleverage customer travel to achieve significant sustainability gains without\ncompromising service efficiency. A multi-objective analysis using the\nepsilon-constraint method produces Pareto frontiers and knee-point solutions,\noffering actionable insights for balancing operational efficiency and\nenvironmental impact in sustainable LMD design."}

Direct numerical simulations show\nthat $\\alpha$ plays an analogous role to that of the Burger number ($Bu$) in\ngoverning the partition of energy between slow and fast modes -- and\nconsequently, the timescale of geostrophic adjustment -- but with key\ndifferences. Increasing $\\alpha$, regardless of the relative strengths of\nrotation and stratification, extends the lifetime of wave energy by delaying\nthe dominance of the slow modes. We find that the creation of an energy pathway\nonly involving fast waves is a universal outcome of the regularization across\nall values of $Bu$, contrasting with a disruption of slow-fast interactions\nthat is most impactful only in the $Bu=1$ case.

The modularity $q^*(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum over all\nvertex-partitions of the modularity score, and satisfies $0\\leq q^*(G)< 1$.\nModularity lies at the heart of the most popular algorithms for community\ndetection. In this chapter we discuss the behaviour of the modularity of\nvarious kinds of random graphs, starting with the binomial random graph\n$G_{n,p}$ with $n$ vertices and edge-probability $p$."}

Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents\nindependently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often\nemerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the\nfuture reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic\nFollow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the\npast rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that\neven a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of\nregret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where\nthe prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We\nfurther capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time\ndelay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our\nWOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant\n($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge\nto the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in\npoly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and\nstrengthened by our experiments."}

A modified\naccelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse\n$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition\nquality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for\nsmall-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree\nfollowed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of\nrepresentative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining\nnodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve\npartitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,\nswapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.\n  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\\%--5\\% on average\ncompared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to\n35\\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm\noutperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,\nMt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and\ncompetitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis\npartitions by up to 16\\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance\nmethodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's\ncompetitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs."}

These constrained deep learning problems are typically\nsolved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but\nsuch approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local\nsolutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,\npractitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the\nstandard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.\nIn this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these\napproaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient\ndescent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer\nthe robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,\nproving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the\nequivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism\nhyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success\nof dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation."}

However, the problem is typically\nintractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,\nwe explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the\nbundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation\nof the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a\nspecific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal\nbundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to\nderive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further\nproposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN\ntrained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve\nnear-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational\ntime for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions\nfor larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as\nbundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions\nfor instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where\nproduct utilities are non-additive."}
