Still, their efficiency depends heavily on the\nchoice of suitable parameters and/or ingredients. Paradigmatic examples include\nthe so-called strong threshold parameter $\\theta$, which controls the algebraic\ncoarse-grid hierarchy, as well as the smoother, i.e., the relaxation methods\nused on the fine grid to damp out high-frequency errors. In AMG, since the\ncoarse grids are constructed algebraically (without geometric intuition), the\nsmoother's performance is even more critical. For the linear systems stemming\nfrom polytopal discretizations, such as Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin\n(PolyDG) and Virtual Element Methods (VEM), AMG sensitivity to such choices is\neven more critical due to the significant variability of the underlying meshes,\nwhich results in algebraic systems with different sparsity patterns. We propose\na novel deep learning approach that automatically tunes the strong threshold\nparameter, as well as the smoother choice in AMG solvers, for linear systems of\nequations arising from polytopal discretizations, thereby maximizing AMG\nperformance. We interpret the sparse matrix resulting from polytopal\ndiscretization as a grayscale image, and by applying pooling, our neural\nnetwork extracts compact features that preserve the necessary information at a\nlow computational cost. We test various differential problems in both two- and\nthree-dimensional settings, with heterogeneous coefficients and\npolygonal/polyhedral meshes, and demonstrate that the proposed approach\ngeneralizes well. In practice, we demonstrate that we can reduce AMG solver\ntime by up to $27\\%$ with minimal changes to existing PolyDG and VEM codes."}

While the correspondence is well\nunderstood in discrete models with spectral gaps, complications arise in the\npresence of unbounded Hamiltonians and varying boundary conditions, leading to\nanomalous behavior that has recently been dubbed violations of bulk-edge\ncorrespondence. In this work we use a K-theoretic framework to identify precise\nconditions needed for unbounded Hamiltonians to be affiliated to the respective\nobservable algebras and define K-theory classes. In special cases we can then\nexclude anomalous behaviour and obtain the standard bulk-edge correspondence,\nor, under weaker conditions, obtain a relative bulk-edge correspondence\ntheorem, which compares pairs of Hamiltonians. Applying that relative approach\nin the bulk we recover among other things the so-called\nbulk-difference-interface correspondence for Hamiltonians that fail to define a\nbulk K-theory class in the conventional way. The second main result is that one\ncan define K-theory classes in terms of von Neumann unitaries, which under\nchanges in boundary conditions directly contribute to the number of protected\nedge states.

In this area, one designs a set of DNA\nstrings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and\ncombinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement\nconstraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent\napplications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints\non DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of\nnon-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint.\nTherefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed\nconstraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement,\n$GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem\nrepeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are\nconstructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and\ncombinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring\nand a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA\ncodes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic\nconstructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields\nDNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We\nbriefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance\netc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that\nsatisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about\nalgebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present\nsome open research directions in this area."}

This paper addresses this challenge by\ninvestigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m -\n1)/\\lambda$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\\lambda$ is a positive\ndivisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length\nwith $m \\geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed\ndistance $2 \\leq \\delta \\leq (q^{\\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \\rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\\lambda}\n+ 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2\n\\leq \\delta \\leq (q^{\\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \\rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\\lambda}$. These\nranges for $\\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for\nthis class of BCH codes.

In the first stage, the\nvariational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice\nand Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their\nobservations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high\nagreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve.

As a representative application, we study\nphysical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely\non the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus\nsuffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility\nscenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated\nsensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps\nmeasured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources.

The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise.

This complexity is especially acute in large\nacademic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities\nacross multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling\nmust account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job\nsatisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often based on statistical\nor rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain\nknowledge. However, these methods often overlook unstructured information,\ne.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys\nand scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized\nclinical resources. Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned\nschedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal\nutilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose a\npredict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician\navailability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization\nmodel. Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable\npreferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes,\nenhancing the reliability of availability predictions.

Closed-form formulas for estimating the expected matching\ndistances under a maximum matching radius are developed for static and\nhomogeneous RBMPs, and then extended to accommodate spatial heterogeneity via\ncontinuum approximation. The ST-RBMP is then formulated as an optimal control\nproblem where optimal values of pooling intervals and matching radii are solved\nover time and space. A series of experiments with simulated data are conducted\nto demonstrate that the proposed formulas for static RBMPs under matching\nradius and spatial heterogeneity yield very accurate results on estimating\nmatching probabilities and distances. Additional numerical results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ST-RBMP modeling\nframework in designing dynamic matching strategies for mobility services under\nvarious demand and supply patterns, which offers key managerial insights for\nmobility service operators."}

The problem is\nstill wide open and here we consider a variant of it for the binomial random\ngraph $G(n,p)$. We prove that, for every fixed $k$, there exists a constant\n$C=C(k)$ such that, when $p\\ge \\frac{C \\log n}{n}$, with high probability,\n$G(n,p)$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings with the property that\nevery pair of them forms a Hamilton cycle. In fact, our main result is a very\nprecise counting result for $K_n$. We show that, given any $k$ edge-disjoint\nperfect matchings $M_1,\\dots,M_k$, the probability that a uniformly random\nperfect matching $M^*$ in $K_n$ has the property that $M^*\\cup M_i$ forms a\nHamilton cycle for each $i\\in [k]$ is $\\Theta_k(n^{-k/2})$.

We\nstudy privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise\nto their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning\nrelies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly,\nwith continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\\epsilon)$, the optimal\nrandomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to\n$\\Theta_{\\epsilon}(\\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$\nrate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action\nand the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently\nsmall $\\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false\nstate, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority;\nrandomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing\naggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$\nrate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets.

We impose that any terminal cost specified by a\nthermodynamic functional should depend only on state variables and not on\ncontrol protocols, according to the canonical Bolza form. In this way, we can\nunambiguously discriminate between transitions at minimum dissipation between\ngenuine equilibrium states, and transitions at minimum work driving a system\nfrom a genuine equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state. For underdamped dynamics\nsubject to a mechanical force, genuine equilibrium means a Maxwell-Boltzmann\nprobability distribution defining a vanishing current velocity. Transitions at\nminimum dissipation between equilibria are a model of optimal swift engineered\nequilibration. Remarkably, we show that transitions at minimum work do not\ndirectly imply explicit boundary conditions on terminal values of parameters of\nthe mechanical force and on control protocols. Thus, the problem often\ndiscussed in the literature, that optimal protocols need terminal jumps to\nsatisfy boundary conditions, completely disappears. The quantitative properties\nof optimal controls are entirely determined by the form of the penalty\nmodelling an experimental setup. More generally, we use centre manifold theory\nto analytically account for the tendency of optimal controls to exhibit a\nturnpike property: optimal protocols in the bulk of the control horizon tend to\nconverge to a universal centre manifold determined only by the running cost.\nExponential deviations from the centre manifold occur at the ends of the\ncontrol horizon in order to satisfy the boundary conditions.

In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is\nproposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical\nconflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory\nconflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing\nthe algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.\n  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion\nsettings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure\nspecific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and\nmotion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no\nmotion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator\nwith participants exposed to passive driving.\n  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model\npredictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the\nlowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The\ncompromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)\ncompared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force\ntracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.\n  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the\nsimulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant\nadvancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific\nforce recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use."}
