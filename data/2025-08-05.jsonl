Comments are very welcome!", "summary": "In this article, we answer a question posed in 1998 by Contreras, Iturriaga,\nPaternain, and Paternain, now known as the contact type conjecture. For a broad\nclass of magnetic systems, we explicitly construct, on any closed manifold, an\ninfinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic systems, which we refer to as\nmagnetic systems of strong geodesic type. For each such system, there exists at\nleast one null-homologous embedded periodic orbit on every energy level, with\nnegative action for energies below the strict Ma\\~n\\'e critical value. As a\nconsequence, the corresponding energy surfaces are not of contact type below\nthis threshold. Thus, for this class of systems, the contact type conjecture\nholds true. Moreover, for these systems, both the strict and the lowest\nMa\\~n\\'e critical values can be computed explicitly, and they coincide whenever\nthe aforementioned periodic magnetic geodesic is contractible, without\nrequiring any additional assumptions on the manifold. Several remarkable\nmultiplicity results also hold, guaranteeing arbitrarily large numbers of\nembedded null-homologous periodic magnetic geodesics on every energy level. We\nillustrate the richness of this class through two types of examples. First, on\nany non-aspherical manifold, there exists a dense subset of the space of\nRiemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, one can construct an\ninfinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic fields yielding magnetic systems\nof strong geodesic type. Second, on any closed contact manifold for which the\nstrong Weinstein conjecture holds, one can construct an infinite-dimensional\nspace of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, the magnetic\nsystem induced by the fixed contact form is of strong geodesic type."}

This design significantly enlarges the\neffective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering\nsuperior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure\ntransmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple\nlegitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure\nsecurity, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward\neavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and\neavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized\nto maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case\nof a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure\nthat minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,\nwe develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging\nRiemannian manifold optimization.

To construct time windows for a pre-determined route (e.g.,\nprovided by commercial routing software), we introduce two criteria that\nbalance window length and the risk of violation. The service provider can\nallocate different penalties reflecting risk tolerances to each criterion,\nresulting in various time windows with varying levels of service guarantee.\nDepending on the degree of information available about the travel time\ndistribution, we develop two modeling frameworks based on stochastic and\ndistributionally robust optimization. In each setting, we derive closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal time windows, which are functions of risk preferences\nand the sequence of visits. We further investigate fixed-width time windows,\nwhich standardize service intervals, and the use of a policy that allows\nvehicles arriving before the lower bounds to wait rather than incur a penalty.\nNext, we integrate service time window design with routing optimization into a\nunified framework that simultaneously determines optimal routing and time\nwindow allocations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our models on a rich\ncollection of instances from well-known datasets. While a small portion of the\ntime windows designed by the stochastic model was violated in out-of-sample\ntests, the distributionally robust model consistently delivered routes and time\nwindows within the service provider's risk tolerance. Our proposed frameworks\nare readily compatible with existing routing solutions, enabling service\nproviders to design time windows aligned with their risk preferences. It can\nalso be leveraged to produce the most efficient routes with narrow time windows\nthat meet operational constraints at controlled levels of service guarantee."}

We begin by constructing presheaves and sheaves to define locally\nringed spaces, which model the local structure of supermanifolds.\nSuperfunctions, a key element, are shown to differ significantly from ordinary\nfunctions, leading to a richer structure. We also prove a key characterization\ntheorem for morphisms between supermanifolds and demonstrate that the category\nof supermanifolds admits finite products.

This, in turn, can be applied to systematically\nconstruct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\\mathcal{V}$; or to construct\npartial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists.\nBecause of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of\nsymmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in\nthe symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie\ngroup actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the\ngeometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is\naltered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important\ninformation toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL\nquotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks\nof various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of\nthe given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL\nquotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\\mathcal{V}$ based upon the\ngeometric properties of $\\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we\nprove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction\nand the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback\nlinearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized\nS-G-S test to identify if $\\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given,\nbased on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the\nwell-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an\ninvariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group."}

We propose a flexible and modular algorithmic framework for\naccelerating Benders decomposition by embedding multi-parametric programming\n(mp) surrogates for optimization subproblems. Our approach leverages the\nOptiGraph abstraction in Plasmo$.$jl to model and decompose graph-structured\nproblems. By solving the subproblems associated with the graph nodes once using\nmp, we can extract explicit piecewise affine mappings for primal and dual\nvariables which replace the expensive subproblem solves with efficient look-ups\nand function evaluations during the iterative Benders process. We formally show\nthe equivalence between classical Benders cuts and those derived from the mp\nsolution and implement this integration in the open-source PlasmoBenders$.$jl\nsoftware package. We apply it to a two-stage stochastic programming problem,\nwhich aims to make optimal capacity expansion decisions under uncertainty in\nproduct demand/prices and availability of raw materials. We evaluate single-cut\nand multi-cut variants of Benders and show that the mp surrogate approach\nachieves substantial speedups in subproblem solve time while preserving the\nconvergence guarantees of Benders. Furthermore, we highlight advantages in the\nsolution analysis and interpretability that is enabled by mp critical region\ntracking. Our results demonstrate that combining mp programming with graph\nmodeling offers a promising and extensible foundation for structure-exploiting\ndecomposition. By decomposing the problem into tractable subproblems, the\nproposed approach also aims to overcome scalability issues of mp, and the use\nof mp surrogates provides a unifying modeling framework to represent\nheterogeneous graph subproblems as common modeling objects."}

In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)].

We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the\nprovince commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post\nbailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose\neffort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a\nstatutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual\nmonotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening\nand admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a\nstatutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a\nparticipation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter.\nA knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an\nexplicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible.\nThe closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to\nNewfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future\ncalibration."}

By directly leveraging structural\nproperties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz\ncontinuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines\ngeneralized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type\ndifferential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while\npreserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper\nprovides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a\nLyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output\nerror bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a\nbalancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and\ndemonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the\nGramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic\nanalysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of\nnonlinear systems under stochastic excitation."}

Although this problem has been\nextensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform\nscaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local\nmatrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position\nformation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e.,\nleaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the\nposition formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate\ndirections. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude\nformation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation\nmaneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the\nproposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing\ngraph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine\nformation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser\nsensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling\ntransformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to\ndemonstrate our theoretical results."}

Their computation is, however,\nchallenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal\ntransport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been\nproposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version\nis restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,\nstrongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an\nappropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the\nunderlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the\nnumerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and\nallowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance\nactually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from\nbelow and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.\nSince we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is\nnumerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;\nespecially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing."}
