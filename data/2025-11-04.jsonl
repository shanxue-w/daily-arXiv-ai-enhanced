The theoretical results indicate\nthat the constructed approach is unconditionally stable, spatial fourth-order\naccurate, second-order convergent in time and more efficient than a large class\nof numerical methods discussed in the literature for solving a general class of\ndelay Sobolev problems.

A key focus is on\nmitigating the oscillatory behavior often encountered in traditional spectral\nmethods while retaining high-order accuracy in smooth regions. We present a\nsystematic comparison between CWENO7-based and generalized polynomial chaos\n(gPC)-based approaches. Although gPC methods achieve spectral convergence, they\nare prone to Gibbs-type oscillations in nonsmooth settings. By contrast, CWENO7\nutilizes local stencils to achieve a balance: non-oscillatory behavior near\ndiscontinuities and high-order convergence in smooth regions. To validate the\napproach, we conduct numerical experiments on a range of one- and\ntwo-dimensional smooth and nonsmooth problems, including shallow water\nequations with random inputs. The results demonstrate that CWENO7 interpolation\nprovides accurate estimates of probability density functions, mean values, and\nstandard deviations, particularly in regimes where gPC expansions exhibit\nstrong oscillations. Furthermore, computational tests confirm that CWENO7\ninterpolation is efficient and scalable, establishing it as a reliable\nalternative to conventional stochastic collocation techniques for UQ in the\npresence of discontinuities."}

However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission\nefficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep\nSemantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel\ncoding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and\nreceiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder\nand decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts\nmessages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during\nneural network training according to channel characteristics and background\nknowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors.\nSpecifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic\nvectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder\nemploys Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic\nvectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is\nensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the\nentire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the\nTurbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing\nof semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA\nsurpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual\nevaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly\nevident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior\ntext semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine\nchannel environments."}

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable. Notably, unlike classical models where the\nelastic and fracture energies converge independently, this model exhibits a\ncoupling of all energy terms.

An integral domain is said to have the unrestricted finite\nfactorization (U-FF) property if every atomic element has only finitely many\nfactorizations, or equivalently, if its atomic subring is a finite\nfactorization domain (FFD). We position the property U-FF within the hierarchy\nof classical finiteness conditions, showing that every IDF domain is U-FF but\nnot conversely, and we analyze its behavior under standard constructions. In\nparticular, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the U-FF\nproperty to ascend along $D+M$ extensions, prove that nearly atomic IDF domains\nare FFDs, and construct an explicit example of an integral domain with the U-FF\nproperty whose polynomial ring is not U-FF.

The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity.

Such distributions constitute a\nfundamental class in probability theory and mathematical statistics, as they\ngeneralize a wide range of well-known discrete distributions and enable the\ndescription of various stochastic phenomena with a predetermined variance\nstructure. The aim of the research is to develop analytical methods for\nconstructing power series distributions with given covariances and to establish\nthe conditions under which a particular function can serve as the covariance of\na certain PSD. The paper derives a first-order differential equation for the\ngenerating function of the distribution, which determines the relationship\nbetween its parameters and the form of the covariance function. It is shown\nthat the choice of an analytical or polynomial covariance completely specifies\nthe structure of the corresponding generating function. The analysis made it\npossible to construct new families of PSDs that generalize the classical\nBernoulli, Poisson, geometric, and other distributions while preserving a given\ncovariance structure. The proposed approach is based on the analytical\nrelationship between the generating function and the covariance function,\nproviding a framework for constructing stochastic models with predefined\ndispersion properties. The results obtained expand the theoretical framework\nfor describing discrete distributions and open up opportunities for practical\napplications in statistical estimation, modeling of complex systems, financial\nprocesses, machine learning where it is crucial to control the dependence\nbetween the mean and the variation. Further research may focus on constructing\ncontinuous analogues of such distributions, studying their limiting properties,\nand applying them to problems of regression and Bayesian analysis."}

However, existing MP control methods have limited consideration of\npublic transportation and do not address the network stability problem of\ntransit-prioritized MP in partially connected vehicle (CV) environments. In\nthis study, we propose Transit-MP, which realizes transit-prioritized MP\ncontrol in partially CV environments by considering real-time vehicle occupancy\nand the impact of transit dwell at stations. Theoretically, we demonstrate that\nTransit-MP, while using different traffic state measures for upstream and\ndownstream links for pressure calculation, still achieves road network\nstability even in partially CV environments. Note that for MP controllers in\nsparse CV environments, some movements may have missing CV observations,\nleading to link spillovers, which create the queue starvation phenomenon: a\nmovement no longer receives the green phase despite the queue spillover.\nTherefore, we further propose a modified Transit-MP (mTransit-MP) that\nincorporates historical traffic data to address this issue. We rigorously prove\nthat the proposed mTransit-MP can effectively avoid the queue starvation\nphenomenon. Experimental results on a real-world corridor in Amsterdam with 15\ntransit lines and 31 stations show that our method significantly reduces the\nreal-time vehicle and spillover count, and improves delays for both private\nvehicles and transit vehicles compared to a state-of-the-art MP controller for\ntransit signal priority.

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable. Notably, unlike classical models where the\nelastic and fracture energies converge independently, this model exhibits a\ncoupling of all energy terms. We also present numerical simulations exploring\nthe sensitivity of the model to mesh anisotropy, offering insight into both its\ntheoretical robustness and its practical implementation."}

First, when the\ninput consists of a superposition of two oscillatory components, $\\cos(2\\pi\nt)+A\\cos(2\\pi (\\xi t+\\phi))$, where $A>0$, $\\xi\\in (0,1)$ and $\\phi\\in [0,1)$,\nwe show that, asymptotically when the sample size $n\\to \\infty$, the PRSA\noutput takes the form $A'\\sin(2\\pi t)+B'\\sin(2\\pi \\xi t)$, where $A',B'\\neq 0$.\nSecond, when the input is a stationary Gaussian random process, we establish a\ncentral limit theorem: under mild regularity conditions, the averaged vector\nproduced by PRSA converges in distribution to a Gaussian random vector as $n\\to\n\\infty$ with mean determined by the covariance structure of the random process.\nThese results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting PRSA outputs\nfor scientific applications."}

Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that\nsystematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN\nbased on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients.\nThrough a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and\ncomputational verification, we identify specific algebraic\nobstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in\nassociated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial\nfactorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential\nuniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN\nfunctions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to\nother classes of potential APN functions.

This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed\ninformation, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the\ninformation-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of\nsemantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token,\nrather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning.

Recently, Raviv proposed the use of\nrandom linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables\nefficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary\nfor neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under\nnoise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery,\ni.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy\ncompositional representation.\n  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First,\nwe argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable\nfor VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a\nfolklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional\nrepresentations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In\nhistogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given\nas input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length\n$N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms.

Using the mixture Gamma model, we approximate the non-centered\nchi-square distribution that describes the total fading of the RF link, and we\nassess the performance of the end-to-end system by analyzing the ergodic\ncapacity, the average bit-error rate (BER), and the outage probability,\ncalculated using the bivariate Fox-H function. We also provide simple\nasymptotic expressions for the average BER and the outage probability at high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, the proposed analysis is validated with\nnumerical and Monte-Carlo simulation results, showing an exact match."}

Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that\nsystematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN\nbased on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients.\nThrough a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and\ncomputational verification, we identify specific algebraic\nobstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in\nassociated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial\nfactorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential\nuniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN\nfunctions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to\nother classes of potential APN functions.

These invariants exhibit wall-crossing behavior and induce a\nRiemann-Hilbert problem. This problem can describe many setups, including the\nD-instanton corrected twistor space of the HM in type II string theory and is\nof independent mathematical interest. We consider a quantum deformation of the\nRH problem, induced by the refined BPS indices.

It was previously argued, using\nS-duality, that the generating functions are higher depth mock modular forms.\nMoreover, they satisfy a modular completion equation, which fixes their shadow\nin terms of other (lower rank) generating functions.

With this in mind, we seek a\nnotion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form.\nIn this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding\ncosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as\nthe background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is\nfoliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This\ncosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the\npresence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one.\nWe define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to\nour framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded\nvalues of the cosmological constant."}

While powerful in\ntheory, their computational performance can be highly variable. Recent research\nhas shown that constructing cutting planes at the projection of infeasible\npoints onto the feasible set can significantly improve the performance of\ncutting plane approaches. Motivated by this, we examine whether constructing\ncuts at feasible points closer to the optimal solution set could further\nenhance the effectiveness of cutting plane methods. We propose a hybrid method\nthat combines the global convergence guarantees of cutting plane methods with\nthe local exploration capabilities of first-order optimization techniques.\nSpecifically, we use projected gradient methods as a heuristic to identify\npromising regions of the solution space and generate tighter, more informative\ncuts. We focus on binary optimization problems with convex differentiable\nobjective functions, where projection operations can be efficiently computed\nvia mixed-integer linear programming. By constructing cuts at points closer to\nthe optimal solution set and eliminating non-optimal regions, the algorithm\nachieves better approximation of the feasible region and faster convergence.\nNumerical experiments confirm that our approach improves both the quality of\nthe solution and computational efficiency across different solver\nconfigurations.

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable. Notably, unlike classical models where the\nelastic and fracture energies converge independently, this model exhibits a\ncoupling of all energy terms.

Many traditional centrality measures--such as degree\nand betweenness centrality--are purely structural and often overlook the\ndynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node's\nimportance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's\ndynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this\nperspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in\noptimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of\naverage opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of\nterminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed\nU-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state.

The first strategy optimizes\nuniform classic policies (e.g., Constant Order and Base Stock) by tuning their\nparameters globally, complemented by a direct search to select the best-fitting\nsuppliers for the integrated problem. The second approach is a hyper-heuristic\napproach, driven by metaheuristics such as a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This framework constructs a composite policy\nby automating the selection of the heuristic type, its parameters, and the\nsourcing suppliers on an item-by-item basis. Computational results from twelve\ndistinct instances demonstrate that the hyper-heuristic framework consistently\nidentifies superior policies, with GA and EGA exhibiting the best overall\nperformance.
