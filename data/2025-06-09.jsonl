Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine\nproperty of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also\nexhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications\nto mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when\ntrained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)\narchitecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global\nsolution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed\nPSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the\nmathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate\nsolutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy\nmanagement problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to\nenergy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of\nconcept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of\npredictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN\nmodel based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for\nPSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training\nusing far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training\ndistribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,\nthe PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a\nsecond for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of\nstochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for\nsimulations and long term planning."}

To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming\nthe scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog\ncomputers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave\nnetwork that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain,\nthereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO\narchitectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate\nachievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing\nMiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate\nmaximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which\nare assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless\nand reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the\nmicrowave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also\ncharacterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided\nbeamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations,\nreveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital\nbeamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF)\nchains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs)\nresolution requirements, and computational complexity."}

However, an\ninterpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and\nanalyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding\nspaces. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is\nequivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational\nframework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this\nequivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad\nclass of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse\nmodels, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI)\nmodels, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of\nconvex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian\ncorrelation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry.\n  In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the\nderivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model\n(Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also\nyields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the\ncomputational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and\nconvex truncation (De et al., 2023)."}

Despite clear biological\ninterpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental\nvalidation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on\nthis framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the\n\\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived\nfrom a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of\nthree coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,\nlateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,\nintermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral\nsynaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,\nrespectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove\nconvergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first\nlevel (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and\nglobal exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics.
