Starting with the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for basic epidemic behavior and the predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra, LV) system for ecological interactions, we then combine these frameworks into a coupled Lotka-Volterra-Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (LVSIS) model. The resulting system consists of four differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible and infected prey and predator populations, incorporating ecological interactions, disease transmission, and spatial dispersal. To learn the underlying dynamics directly from data, we employ several data-driven modeling frameworks: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Ordinary Differential Equations (KANODEs), and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Numerical experiments based on synthetic data are conducted to investigate the learning ability of these models in capturing the epidemic and ecological behavior. We further extend our approach to spatio-temporal models, aiming to uncover hidden local couplings."}

In this study, we investigate the associated exit problem and propose a method to compute the exit time probability, which quantifies the likelihood that a trajectory starting from an initial condition exits a bounded region in phase space within a given time. This estimation plays a key role in understanding anomalous diffusion behavior. The proposed method approximates the α-stable process by combining a Brownian motion with a compound Poisson process. The exit time probability is then modeled using a framework based on partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). The Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation of the solution, involving conditional expectations over stochastic differential equations. These expectations are computed via tailored quadrature rules and interpolation techniques. The proposed method achieves first-order convergence in time and offers significant computational advantages over standard Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. In particular, it avoids assembling and solving large dense linear systems, resulting in improved efficiency. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and performance through two numerical examples, highlighting its applicability to physical transport problems."}

The model couples an Allen-Cahn equation for the biomembrane interface with a variable-mobility Cahn-Hilliard equation governing mass exchange across the membrane. Classical approaches, including nonlinear multigrid and Multiple Scalar Auxiliary Variable (MSAV) methods, require iterative solution of variable-coefficient systems at each time step, resulting in substantial computational cost. We introduce a constant-coefficient MSAV (CC-MSAV) scheme that incorporates stabilization directly into the Cahn-Hilliard evolution equation rather than the chemical potential. This reformulation yields fully decoupled constant-coefficient elliptic problems solvable via fast discrete cosine transform (DCT), eliminating iterative solvers entirely. The method achieves O(N^2 log N) complexity per time step while preserving unconditional energy stability and discrete mass conservation. Numerical experiments verify second-order temporal and spatial accuracy, mass conservation to relative errors below 5 x 10^-11, and close agreement with nonlinear multigrid benchmarks. On grids with N >= 2048, CC-MSAV achieves 6-15x overall speedup compared to classical MSAV with optimized preconditioning, while the dominant Cahn-Hilliard subsystem is accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude. These efficiency gains, achieved without sacrificing accuracy, make CC-MSAV particularly well suited for large-scale simulations of vesicle dynamics."}

We consider a setting in which the control strategy is synthesized using a model-based optimal control problem that includes a penalty term capturing deviation from the plant trajectory, while the same control input is applied to both the model and the actual system. For a general class of optimal control problems, we establish conditions under which the control minimizing the model-based Hamiltonian coincides with the plant-optimal control, despite mismatch between the model and the true dynamics. We further specialize these results to problems with quadratic control effort, where explicit and easily verifiable sufficient conditions guarantee equivalence and uniqueness of the resulting optimal control. These results show that accurate control synthesis does not require an exact model of the underlying system, but rather alignment of the optimality conditions that govern control selection. From a learning perspective, this suggests that data-driven efforts can focus on identifying regimes in which model-based and plant-based Hamiltonian minimizers coincide, thereby providing a theoretical basis for robust model-based decision making and the effective use of digital twins under modeling error. We provide examples to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate equivalence of the resulting control trajectories even in the presence of significant model mismatch."}

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved."}

Classical consistency theory identifies the rate of the Lasso tuning parameter, and numerous studies have established non-asymptotic guarantees. Nevertheless, the question of optimal tuning within a non-asymptotic framework has not yet been fully resolved. We establish tuning criteria above which the Lasso becomes inadmissible under mean squared prediction error. More specifically, we establish thresholds showing that certain classical tuning choices yield Lasso estimators strictly dominated by a simple Lasso-Ridge refinement. We also address how the structure of the design matrix and the noise vector influences the inadmissibility phenomenon."}

In the computation of the value process Y, explicit and implicit schemes are alternately applied to these two generators, while the algorithms from \\citep{ZhaoLi2014} are used for the control process Z. We rigorously prove that the two new schemes have second-order convergence rate. The proposed splitting methods show clear advantages for equations whose generator consists of a linear part plus a nonlinear part, as they reduce the number of iterations required for solving implicit schemes, thereby decreasing computational cost while maintaining second-order convergence. Two numerical examples are provided, including the backward stochastic Riccati equation arising in mean-variance hedging. The numerical results verify the theoretical error analysis and demonstrate the advantage of reduced computational cost compared to the algorithm in \\citep{ZhaoLi2014}."}

The new formulation is founded on the definition of the umbral operator $\\operatorname{\\mathfrak{u}}$ as a functional in the \"umbral ground state\" subalgebra of analytically convergent formal series $\\varphi \\in \\mathbb{C}\\{t\\}$.\n  We consider in detail some specific classes of umbral ground states $\\varphi$ and analyse the conditions for analytic convergence of the corresponding umbral identities, defined as formal series resulting from the action on $\\varphi$ of operators of the form $f(ζ\\operatorname{\\mathfrak{u}}^μ)$ with $f \\in \\mathbb{C}\\{t\\}$ and $μ, ζ\\in \\mathbb{C}$. For these umbral states, we exploit the Gevrey classification of formal power series to establish a connection with the theory of Borel-Laplace resummation, enabling to make rigorous sense of a large class of -- even divergent -- umbral identities.\n  As an application of the proposed theoretical framework, we introduce and investigate the properties of new umbral images for the Gaussian trigonometric functions, which emphasise the trigonometric-like nature of these functions and enable to define the concept of \"Gaussian Fourier transform\", a potentially powerful tool for applications."}

With these enhanced structures, we design a versatile parameter-free and nonmonotone line-search framework that does not require evaluating the inner maximization.

In this paper, we introduce a modification of the randomized Arnoldi process that restores similarity with the Hessenberg matrix generated by the standard Arnoldi process. This is accomplished by enforcing orthogonality between the last Arnoldi vector and the previously generated subspace, which requires solving only one additional least-squares problem.

The results have a three-fold nature: in the first part of the paper, we $p$-adically interpolate the adjoint Kudla lift, exploiting the previously constructed $Λ$-adic Kudla lift. In the second part, we construct higher weight cycles in Kuga-Sato varieties attached to Picard modular surfaces, and show modularity of the generating series of these cycles, thus obtaining a higher weight analogue of the Cogdell lift. Finally, we apply the formalism introduced by Loeffler to construct $p$-adic analytic cohomology classes of special cycles, whose generating series is proved to be a Hida family interpolating the Cogdell lifts in the weight and level variables."}

Although substantial progress has been made on differentially private linear regression, existing methods almost exclusively address the item-level DP setting, where each user contributes a single observation. Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent. These results provide the first unified framework for practical user-level DP estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under dependence, with strong theoretical guarantees and promising empirical performance."}

In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph."}

By parametrizing the filtration using percentiles of the empirical distance distribution, we identify critical percolation thresholds associated with abrupt growth of the largest connected component. These thresholds define distinct geometric regimes, ranging from fragmented spatial patterns to highly concentrated, percolated structures. Remarkably, years with similar incidence levels exhibit qualitatively different percolation behavior, demonstrating that case counts alone do not determine the spatial organization of transmission. Our analysis further reveals pronounced temporal heterogeneity in the percolation properties of dengue spread, including a structural rupture in 2020 characterized by delayed or absent spatial percolation.

Each source is modeled as a Gaussian prior with its own mean and precision, and sources are combined using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), allowing data from the new experiment to update posterior weights. To capture empirically relevant settings in which prior studies may be as informative as the current experiment, we introduce a nonstandard asymptotic framework in which prior precisions grow with the experiment's sample size. In this regime, posterior weights are governed by an external-validity index that depends jointly on a source's bias and information content: biased sources are exponentially downweighted, while unbiased sources dominate. When at least one source is unbiased, our procedure concentrates on the unbiased set and achieves faster convergence than relying on new data alone. When all sources are biased, including a deliberately conservative (diffuse) prior guarantees robustness and recovers the standard convergence rate."}

Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold.

A key challenge in this setting is the potential loss of convergence order due to approximating the physical domain by a polygonal mesh. Unless boundary conditions can be accurately transferred from the true boundary to the computational one, such geometric approximation errors generally lead to suboptimal convergence. To overcome this limitation, a higher-order strategy based on polynomial reconstruction of boundary data was introduced for classical finite element methods in [28, 29] and in the finite volume context in [7, 11]. More recently, this approach was extended to discontinuous Galerkin methods in [32], leading to the DG-ROD method, which restores optimal convergence rates on polygonal approximations of domains with curved boundaries. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the DG-ROD method, establishing existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution and deriving error estimates for a two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion-reaction problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on both convex and non-convex domains. Following and extending techniques from classical finite element methods [29], we prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, the DG-ROD method achieves optimal convergence despite polygonal approximations. Finally, we illustrate and confirm the theoretical results with a numerical benchmark."}

Traditional methods for estimating intrinsic order often prioritize model-specific structural assumptions over predictive utility. This paper introduces predictive order determination (POD), a model-agnostic framework that determines the minimal predictively sufficient dimension by directly evaluating out-of-sample predictiveness. POD quantifies uncertainty via error bounds for over- and underestimation and achieves consistency under mild conditions. By unifying dimension reduction with predictive performance, POD applies flexibly across diverse reduction tasks and supervised learners. Simulations and real-data analyses show that POD delivers accurate, uncertainty-aware order estimates, making it a versatile component for prediction-centric pipelines."}

Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \\textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests."}

The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test."}

Daily hospitalization data from DEIS were smoothed using a 15-day moving average and Savitzky-Golay filtering, and parameters were estimated using a penalized loss function to reduce sensitivity to noise. Retrospective evaluation and real-world implementation in major Santiago pediatric hospitals during 2023 and 2024 show that peak date can be anticipated about one month before the event and predicted with high accuracy two weeks in advance. Peak magnitude becomes informative roughly ten days before the peak and stabilizes one week prior. The model provides a practical and interpretable tool for hospital preparedness."}

The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework.

Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions. We demonstrate how violations of the sufficient conditions may lead to substantial breakdown, such as by producing a non-positive measure under traditional adjustment rather than one with mean 0, or by producing a measure which is deterministically 0 under statistical standardization."}

We propose a shallow KAN framework that directly approximates the temperature distribution T(x,t) and the moving interface $Γ(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. To enhance accuracy, we employ interface-focused collocation resampling. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data."}

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time."}

Building on a prior theoretical contribution that identified fifteen principles of urban antifragility, this paper tests and operationalizes the framework through an empirical assessment of 26 cities selected for their post-crisis adaptation trajectories. Using a tailored diagnostic methodology, we benchmark cities' Stress Response Strategies (SRS) and then evaluate Urban Development Trajectories (UDT) across four weighted dimensions, positioning each case along a fragility-robustness-resilience-antifragility continuum and applying a balanced-threshold rule to confirm antifragile status. Results show that \"resilience enhanced by innovation and technology\" is the most effective response typology (86.9/100), and that six cities meet the antifragile trajectory criteria. By mapping best practices to activated principles and analysing co-activations, the study identifies a robust \"hard core\" of principles - Sustainable Resilience (O), Strategic Diversity (F), Proactive Innovation (I), and Active Prevention (N) - supplemented by operational enablers (e.g., anticipation, mobilization, shock absorption). The paper concludes by proposing an evidence-based, SDG-aligned operational model that links high-impact principle pairings to measurable indicators, offering a practical roadmap for cities seeking to convert crises into sustained transformation.

We store level-set values, gradients, and Hessians on particles concentrated in a narrow band around the interface, advecting them via bidirectional flow maps while using a conventional grid-based representation elsewhere. By interpreting the level set value as a 3-form and its gradient as a 1-form, PFM-LS achieves exceptional geometric fidelity during complex deformations and preserves sub-grid features that traditional methods cannot capture. Our dual-timescale approach utilizes long-range maps for values and gradients, with frequent reinitialization of short-range maps for the distortion-sensitive Hessian, alongside adaptive particle control that maintains sufficient density within the narrow band. We also develop a hybrid particle-grid quasi-Newton redistancing scheme that preserves fine-scale features while enforcing the signed-distance property. Benchmark comparisons in 2D and 3D demonstrate that PFM-LS achieves state-of-the-art volume preservation and shape fidelity against a broad range of existing level-set methods."}

In this work, we investigate the inducibility of Turán graphs $F$. This topic has been extensively studied in the literature, including works of Pippenger--Golumbic, Brown--Sidorenko, Bollobás--Egawa--Harris--Jin, Mubayi, Reiher, and the first author, and Yuster. Broadly speaking, these results resolve or asymptotically resolve the problem when the part sizes of $F$ are either sufficiently large or sufficiently small (at most four).\n  We complete this picture by proving that for every Turán graph $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, the value $I(F,n)$ is attained uniquely by the $m$-partite Turán graph on $n$ vertices, where $m$ is given explicitly in terms of the number of parts and vertices of $F$. This confirms a conjecture of Bollobás--Egawa--Harris--Jin from 1995, and we also establish the corresponding stability theorem. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic analogue for $I_{k+1}(F,n)$, the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex $K_{k+1}$-free graph, thereby completely resolving a recent problem of Yuster. Finally, our results extend to a broader class of complete multipartite graphs in which the largest and smallest part sizes differ by at most on the order of the square root of the smallest part size."}

These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo.

Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses."}

We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $Λ$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $Λ$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \\otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms."}

This estimation plays a key role in understanding anomalous diffusion behavior. The proposed method approximates the α-stable process by combining a Brownian motion with a compound Poisson process. The exit time probability is then modeled using a framework based on partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). The Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation of the solution, involving conditional expectations over stochastic differential equations. These expectations are computed via tailored quadrature rules and interpolation techniques. The proposed method achieves first-order convergence in time and offers significant computational advantages over standard Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. In particular, it avoids assembling and solving large dense linear systems, resulting in improved efficiency. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and performance through two numerical examples, highlighting its applicability to physical transport problems."}

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime.

Deployment of laser terminals enables high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite links (ISLs); however, their limited number, slow acquisition, and instability make forming a stable satellite topology difficult. Existing patterns like +Grid and Motif ignore regional traffic, ground station placement, and constellation geometry. Given sparse population distribution on Earth and the isolation of rural areas, traffic patterns are inherently non-uniform, providing an opportunity to orient inter-satellite links (ISLs) according to these traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose Starfield, a novel demand-aware satellite topology design heuristic algorithm supported by mathematical analysis. We first formulate a vector field on the constellation's shell according to traffic flows and define a corresponding Riemannian metric on the spherical manifold of the shell. The metric, combined with the spatial geometry, is used to assign a distance to each potential ISL, which we then aggregate over all demand flows to generate a heuristic for each satellite's link selection. Inspired by +Grid, each satellite selects the link with the minimum Riemannian heuristic along with its corresponding angular links. To evaluate Starfield, we developed a custom, link-aware, and link-configurable packet-level simulator, comparing it against +Grid and Random topologies. For the Phase 1 Starlink, simulation results show up to a 30% reduction in hop count and a 15% improvement in stretch factor across multiple traffic distributions. Moreover, static Starfield, an inter-orbital link matching modification of Starfield, achieves a 20% improvement in stretch factor under realistic traffic patterns compared to +Grid. Experiments further demonstrate Starfield's robustness under traffic demand perturbations."}

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved."}

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization."}

We establish that the form-defined operator $T_g$ and the natural-domain operator $U_g$ decouple in the unbounded symbols regime: while $T_g$ is governed by linear averaging, $U_g$ is controlled by the quadratic intensity of $|g|^2$. We construct a smooth, nonnegative radial symbol $g$ satisfying the coherent-state admissibility hypothesis with bounded heat transforms for all time $t>0$; for this symbol, $T_g$ is bounded, yet $U_g$ is unbounded. This is a strictly global phenomenon: under the coherent-state hypothesis, local singularities are insufficient to cause unboundedness, leaving the ``geometry at infinity'' as the sole obstruction. Boundedness of $U_g$ is equivalent to the condition that $|g|^2 dμ$ is a Fock--Carleson measure, a condition strictly stronger than the linear average $g dμ$ governing $T_g$. Finally, regarding the gap between the known sub-critical sufficiency condition and the critical heat time, we prove that heat-flow regularity is irreversible in this context and show that bootstrapping strategies cannot resolve the gap between sufficiency and critical time."}

In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations.

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook."}

Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \\textit{et al.} are layered.

Each user requests an arbitrary file from the library. The goal is to design coded caching schemes that simultaneously achieve the maximum sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization. In this paper, we first introduce a unified combinatorial structure, termed the MIMO placement delivery array (MIMO-PDA), which characterizes uncoded placement and one-shot zero-forcing delivery. By analyzing the combinatorial properties of MIMO-PDAs, we derive a sum-DoF upper bound of $\\min\\{KG, Gt+G\\lceil L/G \\rceil\\}$, where $t=KM/N$, which coincides with the optimal DoF characterization in prior work by Tehrani \\emph{et al.}.

Theoretical analysis and numerical comparisons demonstrate that the second construction exponentially reduces subpacketization compared to existing schemes while preserving the maximum sum-DoF."}

However, its integration with higher-layer techniques, such as semantic communication, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the energy efficiency maximization problem in a resource-constrained VLC-based probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) system. In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization. In the PSCom system, the knowledge base is represented by probabilistic graphs. To enable simultaneous transmission of both knowledge and information data, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed. The optimization problem focuses on maximizing energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming, direct current (DC) bias, common rate allocation, and semantic compression ratio, while accounting for both communication and computation costs. To solve this problem, an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach method is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity.

The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator.

The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes."}

At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case."}

Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers.

Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint."}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file.

In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}.

However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data. These results confirm that, when paired an advanced prediction model, PMATIC is robust to prediction mismatch while achieving compression rates that out-perform standard modern compression tools."}

Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, \"problem modification\" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure."}

We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel."}

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results."}

The functionality, while impossible using classical information alone, can be achieved using quantum information. Existing approaches, rely on one-time pad (OTP) encryption, or use computational hardness assumptions that may be vulnerable to future advances in classical or quantum computing. In this work, we introduce and formalize hybrid encryption with certified deletion in the preprocessing model (pHE-CD) and propose two constructions. The constructions combine an information-theoretic key encapsulation mechanism (iKEM) with a data encapsulation mechanism that provides certified deletion (DEM-CD) and, respectively, provide {\\em information-theoretic certified deletion}, where both confidentiality and deletion properties are provided against a computationally unbounded adversary; and {\\em everlasting certified deletion}, where confidentiality is computational before deletion, and upon successful verification of the deletion certificate, the message becomes information-theoretically hidden from an adversary that is computationally unbounded. Our pHE-CD schemes provide IND-$q_e$-CPA notion of security and support encryption of arbitrarily long messages. In the second construction, using a computationally secure DEM-CD that is quantum-safe (i.e. constructed using quantum coding and AES), we obtain quantum-safe security with keys that are significantly shorter than the message. Instantiating the proposed framework using quantum enabled kem (qKEM) as the iKEM, is a future work."}

This paper introduces characteristic mode analysis (CMA) to derive the achievable DoF. Unlike existing works primarily focusing on the DoF of the wireless channel,the excitation and radiation properties of antennas are also involved in our DoF analysis, which influences the number of independent data streams for communication of a MIMO system. Specifically, we model the excitation and radiation properties of transceiver antennas using CMA to analyze the excitation and radiation properties of antennas. The CMA-based DoF analysis framework is established and the achievable DoF is derived. A characteristic mode optimization problem of antennas is then formulated to maximize the achievable DoF. A case study where the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) antennas are deployed at the transceiver is investigated, and a CMA-based genetic algorithm is later proposed to solve the above problem. By changing the characteristic modes electric field and surface current distribution of RHS, the achievable DoF is enhanced. Full-wave simulation verifies the theoretical analysis on the the achievable DoF and shows that, via the reconfiguration of RHS based on the proposed algorithm, the achievable DoF is improved."}
