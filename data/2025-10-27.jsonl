The feasibility of such\nnumerical methods, however, is ultimately constrained by the limitations of\nexisting computation models. Since digital computers constitute the primary\nphysical realizations of numerical computation, and Turing machines define\ntheir theoretical limits, the question of Turing computability of PDE solutions\narises as a problem of fundamental theoretical significance. The Turing\ncomputability of PDE solutions provides a rigorous framework to distinguish\nequations that are, in principle, algorithmically solvable from those that\ninherently encode undecidable or non-computable behavior. Once computability is\nestablished, complexity theory extends the analysis by quantifying the\ncomputational resources required to approximate the corresponding PDE\nsolutions. In this work, we present a novel framework based on least-squares\nvariational formulations and their associated gradient flows to study the\ncomputability and complexity of PDE solutions from an optimization perspective.\nOur approach enables the approximation of PDE solution operators via discrete\ngradient flows, linking structural properties of the PDE, such as coercivity,\nellipticity, and convexity, to the inherent complexity of their solutions. This\nframework characterizes both regimes where PDEs admit effective numerical\nsolvers in polynomial-time and those exhibiting complexity blowup, where the\ninput data possess polynomial-time complexity, yet the solution itself scales\nsuper-polynomially."}

The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block\ncodes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and\nsoft-decision decoding.

It is well known that, in the framework of\nNewtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to\nperiodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and\nsubject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow,\nsolid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these\nphysical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own\nprobability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In\nparticular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process\nwith the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic\nprocess was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the\ndissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic\nprobability density function with the negative probability regimes. In\naddition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability\ndensity function along both the positive and negative axes with slight\nasymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1,\nwe can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent\nbenefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function.\nMoreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system\nand the measurement theory for future investigation.

In QIF there are two main perspectives\nfor the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective\nconsiders all possible runs of the system in the computation of information\nflow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run\nthe system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a\nspecific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all\nother runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and\ntrackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular\nrun based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the\nstatic perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic\nperspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper\nwe take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:\n(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the\nadversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on\nsecrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we\ndemonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic\naxioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the\ndata-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis\nstrong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and\nexplain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we\nshow that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the\nwell-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our\ndefinition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data\nreleases."}

However, until now, the relationships between\nequivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model\ncalibration, has yet to be studied.

In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize\nnon-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free,\nwhich can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource\ntheory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource\ncontent of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible,\nprovides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we\nprove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not\npossible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity\nis not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis\nof such no-go results.

We introduce Pty-Chi, an open-source\nptychographic reconstruction package built on PyTorch that unifies\nstate-of-the-art analytical algorithms with automatic differentiation methods.\nPty-Chi provides a comprehensive suite of reconstruction algorithms while\nsupporting advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe\nrelaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch as the computational\nbackend ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization,\nand seamless access to modern optimizers. An object-oriented, modular design\nmakes Pty-Chi highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging\nmodels, integrate machine learning approaches, or build entirely new workflows\non top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through\nchallenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and\nunstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy,\nversatility, and extensibility. With community-driven development and open\ncontribution, Pty-Chi offers a modern, maintainable platform for advancing\ncomputational ptychography and for enabling innovative imaging algorithms at\nsynchrotron facilities and beyond."}

The proposed architecture is motivated by the recent study\nof monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser (Yukawa and Yamada, 2025)\nwhich establishes an ``explainable'' plug-and-play (PnP) framework in the sense\nof disclosing the objective minimized. The architecture is derived from the\ngradient of a superposition of functions associated with each layer, having the\nweights in the encoder and decoder tied with each other. Convexity of the\npotential, and thus monotonicity of its gradient (denoiser), is ensured by\nrestricting ourselves to nonnegative weights. Unlike the previous PnP\napproaches with theoretical guarantees, the denoiser is free from constraints\non the Lipschitz constant of the denoiser. Our PnP algorithm employing the\nweight-tying nonnegative neural network converges to a minimizer of the\nobjective involving an ``implicit'' weakly convex regularizer induced by the\ndenoiser. The convergence analysis relies on an efficient technique to preserve\nthe overall convexity even in the ill-conditioned case where the loss function\nis not strongly convex. The simulation study shows the advantages of the\nLipschitz-constraint-free nature of the proposed denoiser in training time as\nwell as deblurring performance."}

Although differential privacy (DP) has been widely\nemployed for privacy guarantees, it does not exploit prior distributional\nknowledge of datasets and is ineffective in assessing information leakage for\ncorrelated datasets. To address these concerns, we establish a pointwise\nmaximal leakage (PML) framework when computing NE in aggregative games. By\nincorporating prior knowledge of players' cost function datasets, we obtain a\nprecise and computable upper bound of privacy leakage with PML guarantees. In\nthe entire view, we show PML refines DP by offering a tighter privacy\nguarantee, enabling flexibility in designing NE computation. Also, in the\nindividual view, we reveal that the lower bound of PML can exceed the upper\nbound of DP by constructing specific correlated datasets.
