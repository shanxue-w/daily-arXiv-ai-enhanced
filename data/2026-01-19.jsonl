This method is effective for anisotropic diffusion with mixed derivatives, where classical schemes often fail unless the covariance matrix is diagonally dominated.\n  A key feature of our framework is its robust treatment of boundary conditions, which avoids the accuracy loss commonly encountered in BZ and semi-Lagrangian schemes. For Dirichlet boundaries, we introduce (i) a quad-tree non-uniform stopping time scheme with O($Δt^{1/2}$) accuracy and (ii) a quad-tree uniform stopping time scheme with O($Δt$) accuracy. For Neumann boundaries, we use discrete specular reflection with O($Δt^{1/2}$) convergence, while periodic boundaries are treated using modular wrapping, achieving O($Δt$) accuracy. All analyses are conducted under the practical scaling $Δt \\sim h$.\n  Except for the uniform stopping time scheme, all schemes are explicit. The schemes are unconditionally stable and positive preserving, thanks to the probabilistic structure. To ensure consistency, a non-compact stencil is involved, which leads to the large time step constraint $Δt \\sim h$.

In this work, we establish several new identities connecting Ramanujan's continued fractions of order twenty.

A common measure used for measuring the degree of this divergence is the Lyapunov exponent, which relies on pairwise Euclidean distances between the trajectories at each time. The main limitation of the Lyapunov exponent is its sensitivity to small perturbations in input data. Since many real-world dynamics are likely to contain some degree of inherent noise, we are motivated to construct a chaos measure that is robust to small trajectory perturbations. Persistent homology has been used for proving theoretical stability guarantees under such added noise in the data. As such, we introduce a novel, persistent homology based measure of chaos termed the persistence exponent and prove its theoretical stability. We also prove the existence of an upper bound on our measure, and show its greater experimental stability on the Lorenz and Rossler systems describing fluid convection and taffy pulling. We present an algorithm for computing the persistence exponent given a single time series with N points from a dynamical system that runs in O(N^2 log N) time. We finally show the greater experimental stability of the persistence exponent on time series data depicting a Belousov Zhabotinsky chemical reaction, which transitions from periodicity to chaos and back as the system evolves in time."}

Convex analysis of these functions focuses on (i) conditions for convexity of the function based on properties of its components, (ii) formulas for the convex conjugate of the function based on those of its components and (iii) chain-rule-like formulas for the sub-differential of the function. To the best of our knowledge all existing results on this matter are based on the notion of K-convexity of functions where K is a closed convex cone. These notions can be considered elementary when K is the non-negative orthant, but otherwise may limit the accessibility of the associated results. In this work we show how standard results on perturbation function based duality can be used to recover and extend existing results without the need for K-convexity. We also provide a detailed comparison with K-convexity based results and show that, while K-convexity is not needed for the convex analysis of composite functions, it certainly aids in verifying the conditions associated with our proposed results. Finally, we provide necessary conditions for the conjugate and sub-differential formulas that are less restrictive than those required by the existing results."}

We study this phenomenon for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window and for nonlinear refinements based on the reassignment method, with an emphasis on the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). Working with a two-component harmonic model, we quantify when STFT can (and cannot) resolve two nearby frequencies: a sharp transition occurs at a critical gap that scales inversely to kernel bandwidth and depends explicitly on the amplitude ratio. Below this threshold, the spectrogram ridges undergo bifurcation and form repeating time-frequency bubbles, which we describe asymptotically and, in the balanced-amplitude case, approximate closely by ellipses. We then analyze the STFT phase, showing a canonical winding behavior, and relate the complex-valued SST reassignment map to a holomorphic structure via the Bargmann transform. In the two-component setting the reassignment rule admits an explicit Mobius-geometry description, sending frequency lines to circular arcs in the complex plane. Finally, viewing SST and reassignment through a measure mapping perspective, we derive small-kernel asymptotics that explain when reassignment sharpens energy and when it produces distorted or misleading TFRs; we also introduce a generalized synchrosqueezing framework that isolates the role of STFT weighting and clarifies how alternative choices can mitigate interference in certain regimes."}

This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency. Numerical experiments on elliptic and parabolic problems including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions validate the framework."}

The first of them is a significant simplification of the computations involved in obtaining the Lefschetz number of certain maps, as well as some new Lefschetz fixed-point theorems for unbounded spaces. Indeed, these ideas allow us to obtain a clear lower bound for the Nielsen number of a triad in some spaces, such as, for example, the connected sum of two p-tori (p greater than 2). Another consequence, in the case of homeomorphisms, is that, in the classical axiomatic definition of the Lefschetz number, the wedge-of-circles axiom and the cofibration axiom can be replaced by the single axiom of topological invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number. Using the invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number we also generalize O'Neill's classical result about topological invariance of the fixed-point index and we prove a topological-invariance result for the relative Lefschetz number.

Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.\n  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\\to \\infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.\n  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation."}

The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions."}

Boundary normals and curvature are reconstructed by an adaptive local B-spline scheme that remains robust for strongly nonconvex shapes and large deformations. A posteriori error estimates are obtained from a hatmatrix formulation of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for both square collocation and zero-padded least-squares systems, and are complemented by maximum principle indicators for harmonic problems. Numerical experiments on circular, star-shaped, and amoeba-like domains show that square collocation suffices for moderately complex geometries, while zero-padded least-squares significantly improves interior velocity regularity and pointwise transport accuracy for strongly nonconvex shapes, without altering the source or collocation sets.

Within each patch, the differentiable B-spline representation yields analytic, high-order estimates of intrinsic geometric invariants, supporting curvature-driven and geometry-coupled flows. The organization of control points facilitates coherent updates of both surface samples and spline coefficients under intrinsic velocity fields. A conditioning-aware formulation of the local interpolation system, combined with a Gauss-Seidel refinement of control points, maintains interpolation quality throughout the evolution. Adaptive knot insertion and point redistribution, guided by geometric error indicators and local sampling density, preserve surface resolution and regularity during deformation.

In the Philippines, the annual economic cost of dengue infections is estimated at around PHP 17 billion. Previous studies have shown that controlling the population of mosquitoes capable of transmitting the dengue virus can effectively reduce dengue infection rates. This study explores the use of Wolbachia as a strategy for dengue control by targeting mosquitoes. Since the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes involves substantial costs, careful planning is necessary to balance disease control with the associated economic burden. To address this, we propose a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the transmission of dengue in a population. We formulate single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks to minimize the economic costs associated with releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the hospitalization costs resulting from dengue infections. This study aims to provide insights into the practical application of Wolbachia-based interventions for controlling dengue transmission. While the analysis is grounded in the Philippine context, the approach is general enough to be applicable to other dengue-endemic countries."}

However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems."}

The model is general in that the extended mixed delays of the state variable and control variable are components of all the coefficients, in particular, the diffusion term and the terminal cost. To address the difficulties induced by the extended noisy memory, by stochastic Fubini theorem, we transform the delay variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay, and then a kind of backward stochastic Volterra integral equation with Malliavin derivatives is introduced by the developed coefficient decomposition method and the generalized duality principle. Therefore, the stochastic maximum principle and the verification theorem are established. Subsequently, with Clark-Ocone formula, the adjoint equation is expressed as a set of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations. Finally, a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game with extended mixed delays and a linear-quadratic solvable example are discussed, as applications."}

We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately."}

As our main result, we solve the problem of covering analytic sets by random covering sets generated by arbitrary Borel probability measures on the real line. Prior to this work, a complete solution was not known for any singular measure. Our solution is potential theoretic and involves a generalisation of a notion of capacity in the work of Kahane, who solved the problem of covering compact sets in the classical setting where the random covering process is driven by the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle. One of our key innovations is a simple but powerful application of the Jankov-von Neumann uniformisation theorem, which we believe to have interest outside of this work.\n  In addition, we determine the critical exponent for the covering problem for polynomially decreasing sequences $(cn^{-t})_n$ for random covering sets driven by Borel probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. At exactly the critical exponent, the covering property generally depends on the constant $c>0$, and as an application of our main result, we determine the critical constant for random covering sets driven by natural measures on strongly separated self-conformal sets on the line. The critical constant depends on the multifractal structure of the average densities of the measure, and the result is new even for the simplest case of the Hausdorff measure on the Cantor set."}

The problem addresses both demand and supply uncertainties by incorporating short-term leasing of modular facilities and dynamic relocation of resources. We formulate DSMMCP as a partially adaptive multi-stage stochastic program that minimizes the expected multi-period costs under uncertainty. To tackle the inherent NP-hardness, we develop an enhanced stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) algorithm, which integrates strengthened cut generation, a tailored alternating cut strategy, and an efficient parallelization framework, and we establish structural dominance and monotonicity properties that formalize the value of the strengthened cuts and partial adaptivity. Numerical experiments inspired by a real case study of a large U.S. construction company demonstrate that the DSMMCP framework achieves approximately 15% cost savings over static planning while improving resilience, reducing outsourcing costs, and supporting sustainability. Complementary experiments on synthetic instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SDDiP algorithm in terms of solution quality and runtime, as well as the scalability and robustness of the partially adaptive stochastic modeling framework across different network sizes and uncertainty levels."}

However, existing literature has mainly focused on scenarios involving either purely random or purely deterministic waveforms. This overlooks a critical reality: operational communication standards invariably utilize a hybrid structure comprising both deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the sensing mutual information (SMI) and precoding design specifically for ISAC systems employing communication signals with both pilots and data payloads. First, by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we derive a tractable closed-form expression for the SMI that accurately accounts for the statistical properties of the hybrid signal. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with constraints on the transmit power and communication rate, which is solved via an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed precoding design over conventional benchmarks."}

To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers.

The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly."}

As our main result, we solve the problem of covering analytic sets by random covering sets generated by arbitrary Borel probability measures on the real line. Prior to this work, a complete solution was not known for any singular measure. Our solution is potential theoretic and involves a generalisation of a notion of capacity in the work of Kahane, who solved the problem of covering compact sets in the classical setting where the random covering process is driven by the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle. One of our key innovations is a simple but powerful application of the Jankov-von Neumann uniformisation theorem, which we believe to have interest outside of this work.\n  In addition, we determine the critical exponent for the covering problem for polynomially decreasing sequences $(cn^{-t})_n$ for random covering sets driven by Borel probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. At exactly the critical exponent, the covering property generally depends on the constant $c>0$, and as an application of our main result, we determine the critical constant for random covering sets driven by natural measures on strongly separated self-conformal sets on the line. The critical constant depends on the multifractal structure of the average densities of the measure, and the result is new even for the simplest case of the Hausdorff measure on the Cantor set."}

Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance)."}

ML components offer high fidelity to training data and fast inference, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex multi-scale or multi-physics phenomena. Modern reservoir simulators rely on automatic differentiation (AD) to support efficient and flexible strategies for nonlinear solvers, inverse problems, and optimization problems. Efficient hybrid modeling therefore requires tight integration of the ML components with the simulator's AD framework.\n  We present the first integration of neural networks into the high-performance reservoir simulator OPM Flow. Networks are trained in TensorFlow and imported into OPM, where they are accessed as native AD functions. This presents an efficient framework for hybrid modeling and enables seamless integration in existing simulator workflows.\n  As an application, we introduce a novel, data-driven near-well model. Near-well models are essential in reservoir simulation for accurately representing singular pressure gradients around wells. Commonly used are the Peaceman near-well model and its extensions, or local grid refinement around the wells. Peaceman-type models are limited to simplified flow regimes, whereas local grid refinement is computationally expensive. We address these limitations by training a neural network to infer a Peaceman-like well index from fine-scale ensemble simulations of the near-well region. It is then integrated into OPM Flow with the new framework. Tested on relevant examples for CO$_2$ storage, the method offers high fidelity to fine-scale results at low computational cost, demonstrating the potential of the OPM Flow-Neural Network framework for hybrid modeling."}

To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments."}

The resulting shrinkage function is odd, continuous on R, and continuously differentiable away from the main threshold, yet retains the hallmark SCAD properties of sparsity for small coefficients and near unbiasedness for large ones. This smoothness places the rule within the continuous thresholding class for which Stein's unbiased risk estimate is valid. As a result, unbiased risk computation, stable data-driven threshold selection, and the asymptotic theory of Kudryavtsev and Shestakov apply.\n  A corresponding nonconvex prior is obtained whose posterior mode coincides with the estimator, yielding a transparent Bayesian interpretation. We give an explicit SURE risk expression, discuss the oracle scale of the optimal threshold, and describe both global and level-dependent adaptive versions.

A major computational challenge in such problems lies in repeatedly handling large-scale linear systems arising from spatial and temporal discretizations under uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized low-rank matrix approximation to represent the stochastic stiffness matrices, and approximate their inverses using the Neumann matrix series expansion. This approach transforms high-dimensional matrix inversion into a sequence of low-dimensional matrix multiplications. Therefore, the solver significantly reduces the computational cost and storage requirements while maintaining high numerical accuracy. The error analysis of the proposed solver is also provided. Finally, we apply the method to two classic uncertainty quantification problems: unsteady stochastic diffusion equations and the associated distributed optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solver."}

This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding."}

We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Huber losses.

The mathematical model is given by attenuated ray transforms of the fields along geodesic curves corresponding to a Riemannian metric that is defined by the index of refraction. The data are given at the boundary tangent bundle of the domain and it is well-known that they can be characterized as boundary data of a transport equation turning tensor field tomography into an inverse source problem. This way the adjoint of the forward mapping can be computed using the integral representation or, equivalently, associated to a dual transport equation. The article offers and proves two different representations for the adjoint mappings both in the dynamic and static case. The numerical implementation is demonstrated and evaluated for static fields using the damped Landweber method with Nesterov acceleration applied to both, the integral and PDE-based formulations. The transport equations are solved using a viscosity approximation. The error analysis reveals that the integral representation significantly outperforms PDE-based methods in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable reconstruction accuracy. The impact of noise and deviations from straight-line trajectories are investigated confirming improved accuracy if refraction is taken into account. We conclude that the inclusion of refraction to the forward model pays in spite of increased numerical cost."}

We study this phenomenon for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window and for nonlinear refinements based on the reassignment method, with an emphasis on the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). Working with a two-component harmonic model, we quantify when STFT can (and cannot) resolve two nearby frequencies: a sharp transition occurs at a critical gap that scales inversely to kernel bandwidth and depends explicitly on the amplitude ratio. Below this threshold, the spectrogram ridges undergo bifurcation and form repeating time-frequency bubbles, which we describe asymptotically and, in the balanced-amplitude case, approximate closely by ellipses. We then analyze the STFT phase, showing a canonical winding behavior, and relate the complex-valued SST reassignment map to a holomorphic structure via the Bargmann transform. In the two-component setting the reassignment rule admits an explicit Mobius-geometry description, sending frequency lines to circular arcs in the complex plane. Finally, viewing SST and reassignment through a measure mapping perspective, we derive small-kernel asymptotics that explain when reassignment sharpens energy and when it produces distorted or misleading TFRs; we also introduce a generalized synchrosqueezing framework that isolates the role of STFT weighting and clarifies how alternative choices can mitigate interference in certain regimes."}

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies.

The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes."}

We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent.

Various countermeasures exist to improve resilience against cyberattacks, such as deploying controls that strengthen IT infrastructures to limit their impact, or enabling resource sharing, patient transfers and backup capacities to maintain services of hospitals in response to realized attacks. However, determining the most cost-effective combination among these wide range of countermeasures is a complex challenge, further intensified by constrained budgets and competing priorities between maintaining efficient daily hospital operations and investing in disaster preparedness. To address these challenges, we propose a defender-attacker-defender optimization model that supports decision-makers in identifying effective strategies for improving the resilience of a network of hospitals against cyberattacks. The model explicitly captures interdependence between hospital services and their supporting IT infrastructures. By doing so, cyberattacks can be directly translated into reductions of service capacities, which allows to assess proactive and reactive strategies on both the operational and technical sides within a single framework. Further, time-dependent resilience measures are incorporated as design objectives to account for the mid- to long-term consequences of cyberattacks. The model is validated based on the German hospital network, suggesting that enabling cooperation with backup capacities particularly in urban areas, alongside strengthening of IT infrastructures across all hospitals, are crucial strategies."}

A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\\star\\!\\subseteq\\!\\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance."}

We consider several geometric assumptions and establish important relationships between them."}
