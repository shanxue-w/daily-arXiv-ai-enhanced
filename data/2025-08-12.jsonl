Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities.

We give a step-by-step review of the classical formulation of the\nproblem, where the geometric shape generated by the velocity vectors -- the\nspeed profile indicatrix -- is strongly convex at each point. We derive new\nglobal results for the cases where the indicatrix field is only time-dependent.\nIn such (meso-scale realistic) cases, Zermelo navigation exhibits particularly\nfavorable properties that have not been previously explored, making them\nespecially appealing for both theoretical and numerical investigations.\nMoreover, motivated by real-world phenomena and examples, we obtain novel\nresults for non-convex (or multi-convex) navigation, i.e. when the indicatrices\nfail to be convex. In this new setting -- which is not unlike the corresponding\nFinsler setting for Snell's law -- optimal paths may involve so-called tacking,\nwhich stems from discontinuous shifts of direction of motion.

The capacity of h* to discern between stable\nextraordinary deviations and values that merely appear extreme under\nconventional criteria is demonstrated using empirical data from a mood\nintervention study. A generalisation of h* is subsequently proposed, with\nindividual weights assigned to differences for nuanced contextual description,\nand a variable sensitivity exponent for objective inference optimisation and\nsubjective inference specification.

The remaining open case, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, is addressed\nfor $a = 5q + 1$ with $q \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{252}$, where we give explicit\ndecompositions, often with $q$ expressed as three-variable polynomials. For $q\n\\equiv 0 \\pmod{252}$, we conjecture that a specific polynomial $p_{1}(x,y,z)=z\n(x (5 y-1)-y)-x,~ x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, which exactly satisfies the\ngeneralized Erd\\H{o}s--Straus equation, generates all such multiples of $252$.\nThis conjecture has been verified computationally for $5q+1$ up to\napproximately $10^{10}$, and the corresponding \\textit{Mathematica}\nimplementation is included."}

Numerical results show that the proposed\napproach improves over established achievability bounds of randomized\nsuperposition coding-based UEP schemes with SIC decoding, making the proposed\nstructured AE-based UEP codes a scalable and efficient solution for\nnext-generation networks."}

The mechanical response of the material is modeled by a\nnonlinear constitutive relationship that algebraically relates stress to\nlinearized strain. This approach serves to mitigate non-physical strain\nsingularities and ensures that the crack-tip strains don't grow, unlike\nsingular stresses. A significant advancement is thus achieved in the\nformulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) for such complex scenarios. The\ngoverning equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum and\nthe nonlinear constitutive model, is formulated as a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A classical traction-free boundary\ncondition is imposed on the crack face. The problem is solved using a robust\nnumerical scheme in which a Picard-type linearization is combined with a\ncontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the discretization. Analyses are\nperformed for both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic elastic solid\ncontaining a crack subjected to compressive loads. The primary crack-tip\nvariables**-stress, strain, and strain energy density-**are examined in detail.\nIt is demonstrated that while high concentrations of compressive stress and\nstrain energy density are observed at the crack tip, the growth of strain is\nsubstantially lower than that of stress. These findings are shown to be\nconsistent with the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics, but a\nmore physically meaningful representation of the crack-tip field is provided by\nthe nonlinear approach.

An exact formula is first derived for\nthe number of homomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph into a general\nbipartite graph. While exact, this formula is typically computationally\nintensive to evaluate. To address this, computable combinatorial lower bounds\nare established. When the target graph contains no 4-cycles, the lower bound\nsimplifies and becomes exact. Two additional lower bounds on the number of\nhomomorphisms from a complete bipartite graph to an arbitrary bipartite graph\nare derived using properties of Shannon entropy. The first depends only on the\nsizes of the partite sets in the source and target graphs, along with the edge\ndensity of the target graph.

However, the\ncomputational cost of bootstrap increases with the size of the data at hand.\nBesides, some replicates may exhibit random violations of the positivity\nassumption even when the original data do not. Sandwich variance estimation\nrelies on regularity conditions that may be structurally violated. Moreover,\nthe sandwich variance estimation is model-dependent on the propensity score\nmodel, the outcome model, or both; thus it does not have a unified closed-form\nexpression. Recent studies have explored the use of wild bootstrap to estimate\nthe variance of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). This\ntechnique adopts a one-dimensional, nonparametric, and computationally\nefficient resampling strategy. In this article, we propose a \"post-weighting\"\nbootstrap approach as an alternative to the conventional bootstrap, which helps\navoid random positivity violations in replicates and improves computational\nefficiency. We also generalize the wild bootstrap algorithm from ATT to the\nbroader class of WATEs by providing new justification for correctly accounting\nfor sampling variability from multiple sources under different weighting\nfunctions.

We begin by examining a single-user case and\nderive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by\nneglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for\nlarge service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS\nblockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where\nmultiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly\nserve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by\njointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the\naverage sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting\nstochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample\naverage approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces\nthe expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically\nregenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization\naccurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation\nresults are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial\nperformance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments\nwith significant LoS blockage."}

A particularly interesting phenomenon is that the Klein-Gordon\ncomponent exhibits modified scattering for certain initial data, while for\nothers it undergoes linear scattering-a dichotomy highlighting delicate\nlong-range interaction effects.\n  The major obstacles are lack of symmetry and weak decay of the solution in\ntwo dimensions. To overcome these, we introduce a novel nonlinear\ntransformation of the wave component and reinterpret the nonlinear coupling as\na perturbation of the mass term in the Klein-Gordon equation.

We give a step-by-step review of the classical formulation of the\nproblem, where the geometric shape generated by the velocity vectors -- the\nspeed profile indicatrix -- is strongly convex at each point. We derive new\nglobal results for the cases where the indicatrix field is only time-dependent.\nIn such (meso-scale realistic) cases, Zermelo navigation exhibits particularly\nfavorable properties that have not been previously explored, making them\nespecially appealing for both theoretical and numerical investigations.\nMoreover, motivated by real-world phenomena and examples, we obtain novel\nresults for non-convex (or multi-convex) navigation, i.e. when the indicatrices\nfail to be convex. In this new setting -- which is not unlike the corresponding\nFinsler setting for Snell's law -- optimal paths may involve so-called tacking,\nwhich stems from discontinuous shifts of direction of motion.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different\ncommunication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and\ncapacity limitations."}

This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures.

Based on the characteristics of\nnormal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source\ndepth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial\nvariation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source\ndepth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is\nproposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the\nreceiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray\ntrajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time\ndifference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field\npatterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method."}

We tackle the proposed\nmodels using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical\nexperiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation."}

BUCB scores guide UAV routing to balance exploration and exploitation\nunder uncertainty, while UGV routes are optimized to maximize expected hazard\nreduction under resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nframework reduces the number of dispatch cycles to resolve hazards by around\n30% on average compared to baseline dispatch strategies, underscoring the value\nof uncertainty-aware vehicle dispatch for reliable hazard mitigation."}

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures."}

More\nprecisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for\ncertain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or\nelliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a\nsplitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a\nformulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on\nthis splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered,\nnamely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the\nconvergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In\nthe non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the\ncontraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step\nsize. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed\nto select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its\nconvergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the\nM-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge\nirrespective of the mesh.
