This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data."}

This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $ν$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $ν$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $ν\\ge 0$ with $ν\\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.\n  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort."}

We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning.

This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap.

Regular embeddings of graphs can be regarded equivalently as geometric realizations of the independence complexes and consequently be regarded equivalently as simplicial embeddings of the independence complexes into the vectorial matroids. We prove that if there exists a k-regular embedding of a graph, then there is an induced homomorphism from the embedded homology of the sub-hyper(di)graphs of the (k-1)-skeleton of the (directed) independence complexes to the homology of (directed) matroids.

The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints.

Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics."}

Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility.

These \"latent positions\" are often estimated via embeddings, whereby the nodes of a network are mapped to points in Euclidean space so that \"similar\" nodes are mapped to nearby points. Under certain model assumptions, these embeddings are consistent estimates of the latent positions, but most such results require that the embedding dimension be chosen correctly, typically equal to the dimension of the latent space. Methods for estimating this correct embedding dimension have been studied extensive in recent years, but there has been little work to date characterizing the behavior of embeddings when this embedding dimension is misspecified. In this work, we provide theoretical descriptions of the effects of misspecifying the embedding dimension of the adjacency spectral embedding under the random dot product graph, a class of latent space network models that includes a number of widely-used network models as special cases, including the stochastic blockmodel. We consider both the case in which the dimension is chosen too small, where we prove estimation error lower-bounds, and the case where the dimension is chosen too large, where we show that consistency still holds, albeit at a slower rate than when the embedding dimension is chosen correctly.A range of synthetic data experiments support our theoretical results. Our main technical result, which may be of independent interest, is a generalization of earlier work in random matrix theory, showing that all non-signal eigenvectors of a low-rank matrix subject to additive noise are delocalized."}

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions."}

The proposed mathematical model is thus formulated as a two-player zero-sum game between a clique seeker and an opposing agent. Inspired by regularized continuous reformulations of the maximum-clique problem, we derive a penalized continuous formulation leading to a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem. We further introduce the notion of stable global solutions, namely points remaining optimal under small perturbations of the penalty parameters, and prove an equivalence between stable global solutions of the continuous reformulation and largest cliques that are common to all the adversarially perturbed graphs. In order to solve the given nonsmooth problem, we develop a first-order and projection-free algorithm based on generalized subdifferential calculus in the sense of Clarke and Goldstein, and establish global sublinear convergence rates for it.

We prove in particular that periodic asymptotic stability implies global uniform exponential stability for real linear switched systems of dimension three and complex linear switched systems of dimension two.

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks."}

Originally discovered as a property of harmonic functions, Harnack inequalities have since been studied for solutions of wider classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. In this monograph, we take particular interest in deriving Harnack inequalities for solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation. Finally, we demonstrate a common application of Harnack inequalities by proving the local space-time Hölder continuity of solutions to a class of linear evolution problems. The proof is based on methods introduced by Moser during his seminal work on Harnack inequalities during the 1960s. We conclude by suggesting potential opportunities for future work following on from the topics discussed here."}

We provide a complete characterization of stable and metastable configurations, identify the maximal stability level of the energy landscape, and derive sharp asymptotics for hitting and mixing times. A central technical contribution is a new family of isoperimetric inequalities for polyominoes on the torus, which emerge from a geometric representation of opinion clusters and play a key role in determining critical configurations and energy barriers.

Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform."}

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging."}

In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $λ_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $λ_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $λ_d(n)$, but not on $λ_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management."}

We employ these methods to prove the existence of ground state solutions for a class of semilinear elliptic equations in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with critical Sobolev growth, set in an asymptotically periodic framework where the coefficients converge to periodic functions at infinity. Our approach successfully addresses highly general nonlinearities, including a subcritical term that does not need to satisfy the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and a critical term that extends far beyond the standard pure power assumption to include functions with oscillatory behavior. We prove the existence of ground states under two alternative conditions: either a strict energy gap between the minimax levels of the original and asymptotic problems or a direct energy comparison between the associated functionals. Some restrictive assumptions, such as specific decay rates for the coefficients or monotonicity properties of the nonlinearities, are not required in our results."}

Whereas, the principal, which is exerting an influence on the learning process of the agents in the aggregation, is primarily tasked to solve a high-level optimization problem posed as an empirical-likelihood estimator under conditional moment restrictions model that also accounts information about the agents' predictive performances on out-of-samples as well as a set of private datasets available only to the principal. In particular, we present a coherent mathematical argument which is necessary for characterizing the learning process behind this abstract principal-agent learning framework, although we acknowledge that there are a few conceptual and theoretical issues still need to be addressed."}

In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system.

Secondly, from Molecular Dynamics simulations we extract the molecular reflection coefficient of single water molecules from the air-water interface. This parameter determines the water condensation and evaporation rate at a liquid droplet surface and therefore the evaporation rate of aqueous droplets. We find the reflection of water to be negligible at room temperature but to rise significantly at elevated temperatures and for grazing incidence angles. Thirdly, we derive a thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets that is formulated as a three-phase Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system.

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians.

It is useful for designing robust networks, analysing random walks or information flow through a network and is an important notion in theoretical computer science. Modularity is a measure of how well a graph can be partitioned into communities and is widely used in clustering applications. We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \\geq 2$ edges added per step. We establish new bounds for the likely edge expansion for both random models. Using bounds for edge expansion of small subsets of vertices, we derive new upper bounds also for the modularity values for small $h$."}

Our main result shows that, under a logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, it is given by the same explicit Gaussian Fixed point obtained in [G. Cannizzaro, Q. Moulard, & F. Toninelli, arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344, 2025] for the quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalised coefficients, thereby rigorously justifying and partly correcting the classical Physics derivation of the SBE in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, & H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] based on Spohn's theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. Besides, ours is the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of [M. Hairer, J. Quastel, Forum of Mathematics, Pi, Vol. 6, 2018, e3], to the critical dimension and beyond weak coupling. The major challenge in our work is the mild growth condition on the nonlinearity which renders even the well-posedness of the microscopic equation non-trivial. Additional key novelties include the derivation of fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator as well as a new approximation for the resolvent associated to the solution of the quadratic SBE."}

A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-ζ_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $ζ_n>0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $ζ_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle. We thus complement our previous work to provide a more complete picture of game connectivity across different regimes."}

We remove this limitation by allowing any $α\\in (0,1)$, covering the same range of parameters for which anomalous regularization effects are known to occur in passive scalars. In particular, this covers the physically relevant case $α=2/3$, associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade."}
