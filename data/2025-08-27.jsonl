Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play\na significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by\nkinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than\ndirectly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a\nreduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the\nunderlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the\ncomputational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional\nkinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally,\nmoment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based\ncontrol framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the\neffectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by\ncomparing it to control based on the full kinetic model."}

For\nsimplicity, we conduct the analysis within the specific context of the\nstationary Klein-Gordon equation with a point-like source, identifying a\ngeneralized function that solves such an equation and aligns with the solution\nobtained through the Fourier approach with dimensional regularization. In\naddition to being regular at the source singularity, a notable advantage of our\nsolution is its presentation as a single expression, eliminating the need for\npiecewise definitions. The arguments presented here are applicable to a broader\nrange of situations, offering a novel approach to addressing divergences in\nfield theories using generalized functions.

We resolve this by introducing a\nnovel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian\nBuffet Process (PHIBP), a framework we recently developed for modeling\nmicrobiome species sampling across multiple ($J \\ge 1$) groups. This provides a\ntractable generalization of the duality to processes driven by arbitrary\nsubordinators, yielding explicit laws for both single-group and the previously\nuncharacterised multi-group structured partitions.\n  The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of\nan inherently dynamic, four-component coupled system. This new construction\nsimultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation\noperator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous\nfragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin (2006), and (iv) a dual,\nbackward-in-time structured coalescent. All four components are governed by the\nsame underlying compositional structure, which yields their exact compound\nPoisson representations and, for the coalescent, drives simultaneous,\nacross-group merger events.\n  The chief result is a general coagulation-fragmentation duality that\ngeneralizes Pitman's duality in two fundamental directions. First, it holds for\narbitrary driving subordinators, defining a vast new family of single-group\ndualities. Second, it operates in the previously uncharacterised multi-group\n($J$-group) setting.

In this paper, we demonstrate that\ncoordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the\nlatency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on\nworst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the\nperformance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling\nstrategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency\nunder varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics.\nFinally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations.

This calls for replicating the studies that proclaim the claims,\nbut practice in most fields still fails to implement this idea. When such\nstudies emerged in the past decade, the results were generally disappointing.\nThere have been an overwhelming number of papers addressing the\n``reproducibility crisis'' in the last 20 years. Nevertheless, terminology is\nnot yet settled, and there is no consensus about when a replication should be\ncalled successful. This paper intends to clarify such issues. A fundamental\nproblem in empirical science is that usual claims only state that effects are\nnon-zero, and such statements are scientifically void. An effect must have a\n\\emph{relevant} size to become a reasonable item of knowledge. Therefore,\nestimation of an effect, with an indication of precision, forms a substantial\nscientific task, whereas testing it against zero does not. A relevant effect is\none that is shown to exceed a relevance threshold. This paradigm has\nimplications for the judgement on replication success.\n  A further issue is the unavoidable variability between studies, called\nheterogeneity in meta-analysis. Therefore, it is of little value, again, to\ntest for zero difference between an original effect and its replication, but\nexceedance of a corresponding relevance threshold should be tested. In order to\nestimate the degree of heterogeneity, more than one replication is needed, and\nan appropriate indication of the precision of an estimated effect requires such\nan estimate.\n  These insights, which are discussed in the paper, show the complexity of\nobtaining solid scientific results, implying the need for a strategy to make\nreplication happen."}

We show that, on any\ndigital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no\napproximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no\nreasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit.

Conversely, moment-based distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) effectively employs partial distributional\ninformation but can yield conservative solutions even with ample data. To\nbridge these approaches, we propose a novel method called harmonizing\noptimization (HO), which integrates SAA and DRO by adaptively adjusting the\nweights of data and information based on sample size N.

It is broadly used in financial and\ninvestment planning, inventory control, and also natural disaster risk\nmanagement. Theoretical solutions of multi-stage stochastic programs can be\nfound explicitly only in very exceptional cases due to their variational form\nand interdependency of uncertainty in time. Nevertheless, numerical solutions\nare often inaccurate, as they rely on Monte-Carlo sampling, which requires the\nLaw of Large Numbers to hold for the approximation quality. In this article, we\nintroduce a new approximation scheme, which computes and groups together\nstage-wise optimal quantizers of conditional Fr\\'echet distributions for\noptimal weighting of value functions in the dynamic programming. We consider\noptimality of scenario quantization methods in the sense of minimal\nKantorovich-Wasserstein distance at each stage of the scenario tree. By this,\nwe bound the approximation error with convergence guarantees. We also provide\nglobal solution guarantees under convexity and monotonicity conditions on the\nvalue function. We apply the developed methods to the governmental budget\nallocation problem for risk management of flood events in Austria. For this, we\npropose an extremely efficient way to approximate optimal quantizers for\nconditional Fr\\'echet distributions.

The information given by graphlets up to size (n-1) is utilized\ngraphs having certain type of asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraphs.

The theoretical foundation of\nthis framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof\nthat the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a\nhomotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of\n3-dimensional geometry, originating from a \"Tetrahedron Principle\" where the\nfundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the\ntetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to\nprovide a rigorous proof of the \"Principle of Decomposability\" that underpins\nthe Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical\njustification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To\nestablish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first\nprinciples of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is\nderived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural\nmodels. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by\nconstructing a new observable, the \"H_1-decorated LMO invariant.\" This\ninvariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the\nevaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the\ncorresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this\npaper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens\nspaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the\nclassical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and\nestablishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the\ngeometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern\nhomotopy theory."}

We consider two distinct\nsettings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in\nthe plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a\ncombinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.\n  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable\ncharacterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured\ninto each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip\ngraph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\\\"otzner,\nPerz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we\nprove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the\nnumber of vertices.

We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of\na Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra\nconditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture of\nProkhorov--Shokurov. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the\nBaily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction\nof the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Koll\\'ar on\nthe geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions."}
