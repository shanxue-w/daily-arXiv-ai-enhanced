To address this\nchallenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the\nsensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for\nwhich the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose\ntwo efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain\nhigh-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the\ninherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification\nscaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the\nsignal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.\nFinally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC\ncompared to its passive IRSs counterparts."}

Greenfeld and\nTao obtained two remarkable results on the undecidability of translational\ntiling in recent years. One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a\nspace of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of\ntranslational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided\nthat the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support\nthe following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that\ntranslational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards\nsolving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling\nof a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$\nas small as possible.

Recent research reveals a counter-intuitive paradox: while quick\nresponse systems reduce waste from unsold finished goods, they may incentivize\nfirms to procure more raw materials, potentially increasing total system waste.\nAdditionally, existing models that guide quick response strategies rely on the\nassumption of a known demand distribution. In practice, demand patterns are\ncomplex and ambiguous, and historical data is often scarce, leaving managers\nwithout a reliable framework to determine quick response policies under\ndata-driven settings. Methodology: We develop a distributionally robust quick\nresponse model to address demand uncertainty, building policies that are robust\neven with limited data. We further integrate a novel waste-to-consumption ratio\nconstraint into this framework, empowering firms to explicitly control the\nenvironmental impact of quick response systems. Results: Numerical experiments\nshow that policies optimized for a specific demand assumption suffer severe\nperformance degradation when the real demand pattern changes even slightly. In\ncontrast, our data-driven DRO approach consistently delivers robust and\nsuperior performance across a wide range of complex demand distributions.\nMoreover, we find that the constrained quick response model resolves the\ncentral paradox: it can achieve higher profits with verifiably less total waste\nthan a traditional, non-flexible alternative. Managerial implications: Our\nresearch resolves the `quick response or not' debate by showing that the\nquestion is not whether to use quick response, but how to manage it. By\nincorporating socially responsible metrics as constraints, the quick response\nsystem delivers a `win-win' outcome for both profitability and the environment."}

We provide a\ncomprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct\ndisintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on\ndifferentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple\nexample in which the restricted density and the disintegration density\ndrastically disagree.

Despite\ngrowing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on\nprotocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the\nfundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.

The\npresent contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of\ntraditional hypothesis testing.

Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices\nperformance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We\naddress the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to\nimprove its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -\nfor example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control\n(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its\nworst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we\ncharacterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for\nclasses of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting\nfrom a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the\nmodifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our\nresults apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for\nnonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for\nstrongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over\npolyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on\nsolving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to\nill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems."}

In a bipartite\ngraph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching\nis defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any\nmatching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only\nthe vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem\nallowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have\npreferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings\nis how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires\nexponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we\nhave the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural\ncharacterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by\nmaximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are\nspecifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of\nthe popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the\nsame manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the\npopular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct\nconnection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three\nproblems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from\nthe other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular\nmatchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of\nthe two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the\ngraph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the\nmaximum-weight matching problem."}
