At\nthis time, the classical function space has certain restrictions. For example,\nit has lost its effectiveness for nonlinear problems under nonstandard growth\nconditions. In the process of studying such nonlinear problems, scholars are\npaying more and more attention to the transition from classical function space\nto variable exponent function space. Also, there is a big difference between\nvariable exponent space and classical function space, mainly because variable\nexponent function space has lost translation invariance. This difference leads\nto many properties that hold in classical space no longer hold in variable\nexponent space. It is important to emphasize that variable exponent function\nspaces are a fundamental building block in harmonic analysis. In recent years,\nthere has been a growing interest in the study of function spaces equipped with\nvariable exponents, leading to the development of a new framework known as\nvariable exponent analysis. These spaces provide a powerful tool for analyzing\nfunctions with variable growth or decay rates and have found applications in\nvarious areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations,\nharmonic analysis and image processing. One can better understand the\nheterogeneity and complexity inherent in many real world phenomena by taking\ninto consideration the theory of variable exponent function spaces.

Every\nvector in the interior of $K$ is assigned a full-dimensional cone of\ncertificates, making the numerical computation of rigorous certificates easy,\nprovided that the dual cone has an efficiently computable logarithmically\nhomogeneous self-concordant barrier.

The existing literature\ntypically focuses on the existence of equilibrium by using the PDE approach,\nwhich requires certain Markovian structure and the equilibrium is in the bridge\nform. We shall provide a new approach which is used widely for stochastic\ncontrols and stochastic differential games. We characterize all equilibria\nthrough a coupled system of forward backward SDEs, where the forward one is the\nconditional law of the inside information and the backward one is the insider's\noptimal value. In particular, when the time duration is small, we show that the\nFBSDE is wellposed and thus the game has a unique equilibrium. This is the\nfirst uniqueness result in the literature, without restricting the equilibria\nto certain special structure. Moreover, this unique equilibrium may not be\nMarkovian, indicating that the PDE approach cannot work in this case. We next\nstudy the set value of the game, which roughly speaking is the set of insider's\nvalues over all equilibria and thus is by nature unique. We show that, although\nthe bridge type of equilibria in the literature does not satisfy the required\nintegrability for our equilibria, its truncation serves as a desired\napproximate equilibrium and its value belongs to our set value. Finally, we\ncharacterize our set value through a level set of certain standard HJB\nequation."}

Increasing\nrecent examples from various fields, indicate that, the light-tailed noise\nmodel is overly idealized in many practical instances, failing to capture the\ncomplexity and variability of noises in real-world scenarios, such as the\npresence of outliers or extreme values from data science and statistical\nlearning. To address this issue, we propose a new DSGM framework that\nincorporates stochastic gradients under sub-Weibull randomness. We study a\ndistributed composite stochastic mirror descent scheme with sub-Weibull\ngradient noise (DCSMD-SW) for solving a distributed composite optimization\n(DCO) problem over the time-varying multi-agent network. By investigating\nsub-Weibull randomness in DCSMD for the first time, we show that the algorithm\nis applicable in common heavy-tailed noise environments while also guaranteeing\ngood convergence properties. We comprehensively study the convergence\nperformance of DCSMD-SW. Satisfactory high probability convergence rates are\nderived for DCSMD-SW without any smoothness requirement. The work also offers a\nunified analysis framework for several critical cases of both algorithms and\nnoise environments."}

We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being\nself-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a\nparticular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically\nsymmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the\nminimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in\nthe context of false vacuum decay.

For\ninstance, surprisingly, for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward\nvariant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent.\nAlthough sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity over gradient\ndescent for various problems, they often involve highly nontrivial subproblems\nthat incur significantly higher per-iteration costs, resulting in a much worse\noverall operation complexity. These limitations arise from treating the\nsubproblem as an afterthought, either by handling it as a black box, thus\npermitting complex, highly nontrivial, and nearly unimplementable formulations,\nor by evaluating subproblem solutions in isolation, without considering their\neffectiveness in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By\ntightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem\nsolver and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce\nsimple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton methods, which, in a sense,\nremain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by\nretaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference,\nhowever, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed\nbased on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables\ndesirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard\nassumptions, we show that our variants match the worst-case complexity of\ngradient descent in strongly convex settings, both in iteration and operation\ncomplexity, and achieve competitive iteration complexity for general convex\nproblems."}

It incorporates several innovative\noptimization techniques and utilizes parallel computing to enhance efficiency.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on large-scale STG2 instances\nprovided by our industry partner, encompassing networks with 1,000 to 2,600\nnodes. Results demonstrate that within a one-hour time limit and a 16 GB memory\nlimit set by the industry partner, our heuristic improves the objective values\nof the best-known solutions by 18.5\\% on average, highlighting its significant\npotential for practical applications."}

We decouple the velocity $\\bm u$ and pressure $p$ by deriving a novel\nbiharmonic equation in $\\Omega$ and third-order boundary conditions on\n$\\partial\\Omega$. In contrast to the fourth-order streamfunction approach, our\nformulation does not require $\\Omega$ to be simply connected. For smooth\nvelocity fields $\\bm u$ in two dimensions, we explicitly construct a finite\ndifference method (FDM) with sixth-order consistency to approximate $\\bm u$ at\nall relevant grid points: interior points, boundary side points, and boundary\ncorner points. The resulting scheme yields two linear systems\n$A_1u^{(1)}_h=b_1$ and $A_2u^{(2)}_h=b_2$, where $A_1,A_2$ are constant\nmatrices, and $b_1,b_2$ are independent of the pressure $p$ and the kinematic\nviscosity $\\nu$. Thus, the proposed method is pressure- and viscosity-robust.\nTo accommodate velocity fields with less regularity, we modify the FDM by\nremoving singular terms in the right-hand side vectors. Once the discrete\nvelocity is computed, we apply a sixth-order finite difference operator to\napproximate the pressure gradient locally, without solving any additional\nlinear systems. In our numerical experiments, we test both smooth and\nnon-smooth solutions $(\\bm u,p)$ in a square domain, a triply connected domain,\nand an $L$-shaped domain in two dimensions. The results confirm sixth-order\nconvergence of the velocity and pressure gradient in the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm for\nsmooth solutions. For non-smooth velocity fields, our method achieves the\nexpected lower-order convergence. Moreover, the observed velocity error $\\|{\\bm\nu}_h-\\bm u\\|_{\\infty}$ is independent of the pressure $p$ and viscosity $\\nu$."}

The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a\npriori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional\napproaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework\nincorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field\nattenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves\nto avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode\nconfigurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite\nelement (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model\naccounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the\nfeasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1\nmethod was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both\nnoiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect\nattenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current\ndistribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization\nextracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These\nconfigurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high\ngain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods,\nthe L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation\nwithin the target region while minimizing unintended current spread,\nparticularly under noisy conditions.

An optimal experimental design (OED) refers to the choice\nof a particular experiment that optimizes a particular design criteria, e.g.,\nmaximizing a utility function, which measures the information content of the\ndata. However, traditional approaches for optimal experimental design typically\nrequire solving a large number of computationally intensive inverse problems to\nfind the data that maximizes the utility function. Here, we introduce two novel\nOED criteria that are specifically crafted for the data consistent inversion\n(DCI) framework, but do not require solving inverse problems. DCI is a specific\napproach for solving a class of stochastic inverse problems by constructing a\npullback measure on uncertain parameters from an observed probability measure\non the outputs of a quantity of interest (QoI) map. While expected information\ngain (EIG) has been used for both DCI and Bayesian based OED, the\ncharacteristics and properties of DCI solutions differ from those of solutions\nto Bayesian inverse problems which should be reflected in the OED criteria. The\nnew design criteria developed in this study, called the expected scaling effect\nand the expected skewness effect, leverage the geometric structure of\npre-images associated with observable data sets, allowing for an intuitive and\ncomputationally efficient approach to OED. These criteria utilize singular\nvalue computations derived from sampled and approximated Jacobians of the\nexperimental designs. We present both simultaneous and sequential (greedy)\nformulations of OED based on these innovative criteria. Numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness in our approach for solving stochastic inverse\nproblems."}

Resistance distance, also referred to as effective resistance, is a\nwell-known graph metric that arises naturally by considering a graph as an\nelectrical circuit; heuristically resistance distance measures both the number\nof paths between two vertices in a graph and the cost of each path. This topic\nfinds applications in a rich array of fields including social, biological,\necological, and transportation networks, chemistry, graph theory, numerical\nlinear algebra, and engineering. A variety of methods are used in the field to\ndetermine resistance distance including recursive, mathematical, and graphical\ntechniques.

This yields a\nnormalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks\nformed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring\ndirectionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles,\nand admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback,\nweighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although\nthe decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all\ndecompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable\ntopological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark\ndecompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity\nsolution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF)\nsolution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular\nflow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network\nstructure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability\nof both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks. They outperform\nexisting circularity metrics in detecting meaningful structural variation. The\ndecomposition also enables structural analysis - such as mapping the\ndistribution of cyclic flow - and supports practical applications that require\nexplicit flow allocation or routing, including multilateral netting and\nefficient transport."}
