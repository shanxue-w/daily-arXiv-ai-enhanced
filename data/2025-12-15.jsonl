Inputs are drawn from a prescribed probability measure on the input space, and outputs are (possibly noisy) evaluations of the target operator. We regard admissible operators as square-integrable maps with respect to a fixed approximation measure, and we measure reconstruction error in the corresponding Bochner norm. For a finite-dimensional approximation space $V$ of dimension $N$, we study weighted least squares estimators in $V$ and establish probabilistic stability and accuracy bounds in the Bochner norm. We show that there exist sampling measures and weights - defined via an operator-level Christoffel function - that yield uniformly well-conditioned Gram matrices and near-optimal sample complexity, with a number of training samples $M$ on the order of $N \\log N$. We complement the analysis by constructing explicit operator approximation spaces in cases of interest: rank-one linear operators that are dense in the class of bounded linear operators, and rank-one polynomial operators that are dense in the Bochner space under mild assumptions on the approximation measure. For both families we describe implementable procedures for sampling from the associated optimal measures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on several benchmark problems, including learning solution operators for the Poisson equation, viscous Burgers' equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations."}

Deconvolution of this data is an ill-posed problem and regularisation is required to provide feasible solutions. Deconvolution with regularisation is applied to a synthetic feed consisting of particles of constant density that vary in size only. It was found that the feed size distribution could be successfully deconvolved from the bag weights, with an accuracy that improved as the rate acceleration of the fluidisation rate was decreased. The deconvolution error only grew linearly with error in the measured bag masses. It was also shown that combining data from two different liquids can improve the accuracy."}

We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components.

That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains.

When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy."}

Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D>0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K>1$ and deviation factor $σ>0$. By fixing $σ$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\\triangleqσ\\sqrt{2\\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $σ$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection."}

On the one hand, the bulk index is the sum of the Hall conductance, which is a well-studied quantized topological number, and an additional contribution from the bulk-localized modes as a consequence of the Anderson localization. On the other hand, the edge index, which characterizes the averaged angular momentum of waves in the mobility gap, is uniquely associated with finite systems. Our main result proves that as the sample size tends to infinity, the edge index converges to the bulk index almost surely. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite disordered systems.

First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each."}

Adopting an \"optimize-then-discretize\" strategy, we first apply a constraint-preserving continuous Riemannian gradient flow on an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, which is subsequently mapped to the neural network parameter space via Galerkin projection. This process naturally induces a Sobolev energy metric that incorporates physical information, effectively mitigating stiffness during optimization. To address the explicit dependence on the normalization constant caused by the nonlinear interaction term in the GPE, we design a hybrid sampling strategy combining an integration stream and a MCMC stream to achieve precise estimation of the generalized Gram matrix and energy gradients. Numerical experiments on benchmark cases, including the harmonic oscillator potential in the strong interaction limit and multi-scale optical lattice potentials, demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, it achieves an order-of-magnitude acceleration in convergence compared to standard optimizers like Adam, exhibiting superior robustness in handling strong nonlinearities and complex geometric constraints."}

The present paper continues this programme by constructing and comparing several models for the higher algebraic K-theory of $(T,Γ)$. Starting from the Quillen-exact category $\\mathcal{C} := T\\text{-Mod}^{\\mathrm{bi}}$ of bi-finite, slot-sensitive $n$-ary $Γ$-modules introduced earlier, we define the higher K-groups $K_{n}(T,Γ)$ via Quillen's Q-construction~\\cite{Quillen73} on $\\mathcal{C}$ and via Waldhausen's $S_{\\bullet}$-construction~\\cite{Waldhausen85} on the Waldhausen category of bounded chain complexes in $\\mathcal{C}$.

This yields a generalized Pythagorean theorem for projections and a Legendre duality that couples distortion constraints with inverse temperature parameters. Second, the reverse water-filling metaphor is extended to distributed lattice quantization, deriving distortion allocation bounds across eigenmodes of conditional covariance matrices. Third, inference is formalized as decoding by showing that belief propagation in LDPC ensembles and polarization in polar codes can be interpreted as recursive variational inference procedures. These results unify compression, quantization, and decoding as convex projections of continuous information onto discrete manifolds. Extensions to neural compression and quantum information are sketched as corollaries, illustrating the universality of the framework. Illustrative connections to other scientific fields are also presented. Finally, complementary numerical examples and scripts are located in the appendix"}

The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective. Statistically, such stationary points converge to the ground truth with rate $\\mathcal{O}(R^{-1/2})$ where $R$ is the number of reads.

Finally, we employ a new implementation of the boundary conditions that requires no iterative or extrapolation procedure. The method achieves fourth-order in 1D and second-order in 2D for simulations with moving boundaries. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on classical test cases such as the driven square cavity, shear layer, and shock tube."}

For an ideal $I \\subset \\mathcal{E}(Ω)$, we denote by $Z(I)$ its zero set. A classical result of René Thom asserts that if $I$ is a finitely generated Łojasiewicz ideal, then $Z(I)$ contains an open dense subset of smooth points. The goal of this note is to examine a converse question: does the existence of an open dense set of smooth points in $Z(I)$ ( $I\\subset\\mathcal{E}(Ω) $ is a finitely generated ideal) imply that the ideal $I$ is Łojasiewicz? We analyze obstructions to such a converse and identify geometric conditions under which it fails.\n  As an application, we study smooth real-valued functions of two variables whose zero set coincides with the classical Hawaiian earring, the union of infinitely many tangent circles accumulating at the origin. We show that any such function must be flat at the origin, in the sense that all partial derivatives vanish there. We formulate a geometric criterion concerning families of smooth arcs tangent at a point with unbounded or infinitely varying curvature, and derive from it a degenerate form of the Łojasiewicz inequality adapted to this non-analytic setting."}

The approach proceeds by optimizing a configuration-constrained PWA approximation of the value function of an infinite-horizon min-max Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Here, robustness and performance are maintained by enforcing the PWA approximation to be a generalized control Lyapunov function for the given nonlinear system. This enables the generation of feedback laws with configurable storage complexity and pre-determined evaluation times, based on a selected configuration template. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through a constrained Van der Pol oscillator case study, where an explicit PWA controller with certified ergodic performance and specified complexity is synthesized over a large operational domain."}

Unfortunately, the implementation of filters for nonlinear, possibly high-dimensional, dynamical systems is far from straightforward, as computational methods have to meet a delicate trade-off involving stability, accuracy and computational cost. In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic Itô process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid.

While traditional beam prediction approaches primarily rely on in-band beam training, recent advances have started to explore multimodal sensing to extract environmental semantics for enhanced prediction. However, the performance of existing multimodal fusion methods degrades significantly in real-world settings because they are vulnerable to missing data caused by sensor blockage, poor lighting, or GPS dropouts. To address this challenge, we propose AMBER ({A}daptive multimodal {M}ask transformer for {BE}am p{R}ediction), a novel end-to-end framework that processes temporal sequences of image, LiDAR, radar, and GPS data, while adaptively handling arbitrary missing-modality cases. AMBER introduces learnable modality tokens and a missing-modality-aware mask to prevent cross-modal noise propagation, along with a learnable fusion token and multihead attention to achieve robust modality-specific information distillation and feature-level fusion. Furthermore, a class-former-aided modality alignment (CMA) module and temporal-aware positional embedding are incorporated to preserve temporal coherence and ensure semantic alignment across modalities, facilitating the learning of modality-invariant and temporally consistent representations for beam prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world DeepSense6G dataset demonstrate that AMBER significantly outperforms existing multimodal learning baselines. In particular, it maintains high beam prediction accuracy and robustness even under severe missing-modality scenarios, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability."}

In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic Itô process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid.

Specifically, this allows the initial distribution of agents to be a sum of Dirac masses. The existence theorem requires a smallness condition on the size of the terminal data for the value function (or, alternatively, on the size of the Hamiltonian); no smallness condition on the size of the initial data or on the size of the time horizon is required.

We apply these results to study spectral algorithms followed by rounding procedures in dense stochastic block models and synchronization problems over the cyclic and circle groups, obtaining the first precise asymptotic characterizations of the error rates of such algorithms."}

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods."}

It is challenging to establish the inviscid limit over large time periods for the incompressible Euler equations under the influence of the weak dissipative mechanism generated by the friction force. We first prove the global stability of the equilibrium, in the sense that initial perturbations with appropriate Besov spatial regularity lead to global well-posedness and uniform regularity estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for strong solutions of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. In particular, we establish the optimal rates of convergence to equilibrium uniformly in Navier-Stokes. Then, we construct global solutions to the inhomogeneous Euler-Fokker-Planck equations via the vanishing viscosity limit. Furthermore, by capturing the dissipation arising from two-phase interactions, we rigorously justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the inviscid limit process, with a convergence rate that is in sharp contrast to that in the pure incompressible fluid case. To achieve this global convergence, novel ideas and new techniques are developed in the analysis and may be applied to other significant problems."}

Therefore, we begin by relaxing the binary constraints into continuous box constraints and incorporate an l1/2 regularization term to drive the relaxed variables toward binary values. We prove that when the regularization parameter is larger than a threshold, the regularized problem is equivalent to the original problem: they share identical local and global minima, and all Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the regularized problem are feasible assignment matrices. To solve the regularized problem approximately and efficiently, we adopt the variable splitting technique, and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, in which all subproblems admit closed-form solutions. Detailed theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence, and finite-step termination under certain conditions. Finally, the algorithm is validated on various numerical tests."}

Previous peridynamic models, when directly discretized, have exhibited a lack of asymptotically compatibility with their corresponding local elastic solutions. Additionally, these models have faced challenges in accurately computing the volume of intersecting regions between the horizon of the material point and its neighboring cells. These difficulties in numerical simulations within peridynamics have spurred numerous efforts to develop corrective numerical methods. While such corrective methods have addressed certain issues, they remain complex to formulate and computationally intensive. Instead of addressing these challenges through modified numerical discretization, this paper presents a novel approach: bond-based peridynamics with a Gaussian kernel . This model replaces the bounded kernel function commonly used in existing peridynamic models with an unbounded Gaussian kernel function. Through direct meshfree discretization, we demonstrate that the solution of the proposed model , without the need for compatibility correction or volume correction, aligns with the corresponding local elastic solution. Furthermore, we derive the relevant material parameters based on energy equivalence to an elastic continuum model. Building upon this foundation, we propose a damage model and a linearized version of the proposed peridynamic model. We validate our proposed model through simulations of 2D smooth problems, demonstrating its convergence and accuracy. Finally, we assess the applicability of our approach to realistic scenarios by predicting displacements caused by a 2D plate with pre-existing cracks and replicating high-velocity impact results from the Kalthoff-Winkler experiments."}

In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective.

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

We provide evidence for the conjecture by comparing our constructions to $p$-adic $L$-functions. In addition, we prove it in certain situations where the totally real field is Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$, as a consequence of the fact that in this case there is a conjugate of a Gross--Stark unit in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$."}

Accepted to ITCS 2026", "summary": "In this paper we study a basic and natural question about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which has applications to the study of Matching Vector based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -> C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?\n  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying \"S-decoding polynomials\" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.\n  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers. Many interesting questions remain open."}

In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems."}

While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\\% to 130\\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\\% for nominal loads and below 3\\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates."}

The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example."}

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems."}

We developed a general optimization framework to balance costs related to infection and to mitigation. Optimizing the trade-off between mitigation and infection cost, we identified three novel, surprising effects: First, assuming a constant reproduction number $R_0$, the optimal response to an infectious disease requires either strict mitigation or none at all, depending on disease severity, but never does one find an intermediate mitigation level to be optimal. Second, under seasonal variations, optimal mitigation is stricter during winter. Interestingly, a single wave of infections still arises in spring with 3 months delay to the seasonal peak of infectivity, replacing the autumn/winter waves known for classical influenza. Third, during steady vaccination campaigns, even optimal mitigation can result in transient infection waves. Finally, we quantify the cost of delayed mitigation onset and show that even short delays can substantially increase total costs -- if the disease is severe. Overall, our framework is easily applicable to general and complex settings and thereby presents a versatile tool to explore optimal mitigation strategies for endemic and pandemic infectious disease."}

The proposed framework requires three main key components: input-output data from the element to be modelled, expert knowledge to define the model structure, and data-fitting techniques to obtain optimal parameters. The methodology is evaluated using a realistic benchmark from an UDS in Madrid, Spain. The results show high model accuracy and improved performance within a MPC scheme, reducing discharge and increasing treatment facilities utilization."}

We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. We believe that this alternative view will further advance research on the optimization of neural networks."}

Plaza"], "title": "Stability of stationary reaction diffusion-degenerate Nagumo fronts I: spectral analysis", "categories": ["math.AP"], "comment": "35 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "This paper establishes the spectral stability of monotone, stationary front solutions for reaction-diffusion equations where the reaction function is of Nagumo (or bistable) type and with diffusion coefficients which are density dependent and degenerate at zero (one of the equilibrium points of the reaction). These stationary profiles connect the non-degenerate equilibrium point with the degenerate state at zero, they are monotone, and arrive to the degenerate state at a finite point. They are neither sharp nor smooth. The degeneracy of the diffusion precludes the application of standard techniques to locate the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave in the energy space $L^2$. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the spectrum, the analysis of singular sequences, a generalized convergence of operators technique and refined energy estimates. It is shown that the $L^2$-spectrum of the linearized operator around the front is real and with a spectral gap, that is, a positive distance between the imaginary axis and the rest of the spectrum, with the exception of the origin. Moreover, the origin is a simple isolated eigenvalue, associated to the derivative of the profile as eigenfunction (the translation eigenvalue). Finally, it is shown that the linearization generates an analytic semigroup that decays exponentially outside a one-dimensional eigenspace associated to the zero eigenvalue."}

Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications."}

The liar's aim is to steer the population towards consensus at their goal opinion by showing 'apparent opinions', or 'lies', to members of the population. We analyse this as an optimal control problem for how best to lie to a population in order to guarantee the consensus that the liar desires. We consider a range of regularisations, each motivated by some social convention, such as the liar wanting to present an opinion close to their true opinion. For each regularisation, we demonstrate the effect of instantaneous controls. Furthermore, we introduce a Boltzmann-type description for the corresponding kinetic system and present analysis and numerical results for the resulting Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations."}
