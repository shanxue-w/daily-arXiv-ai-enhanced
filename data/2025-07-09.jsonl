It binds together three disparate groups of\nactors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between\nthese groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and\nsystem structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often\nneglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex\nhuman-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the\ndisparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.\nTo act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other\ngroups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and\nshortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)\ndecision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed\nin three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different\ngroups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify\nchallenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We\nfocus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the\nintegrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine\ninteraction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these\nshortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures."}

Eventually, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends on $2^N$, with $N$ the number of iterations\nanalyzed, that yield tight guarantees, attained by specific functions and noise\ndistributions within these classes. On the other side of the spectrum, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends linearly on $N$, and numerically show that, on\nmany problems, they already provide tight guarantees.\n  The framework accommodates a wide range of stochastic settings, with finite\nor infinite support, including the unstructured noise model with bounded\nvariance, finite-sum optimization, and block-coordinate methods, in a unified\nmanner, as guarantees apply to any setting consistent with the noise model,\ni.e., its expectation and variance.

These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating\nnegative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to\npotential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the\nhuman capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper\nintervention.

In this\nwork, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for\nBPDN using differential inclusions.

Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically\nup to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and\nvery fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show\nthat the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and\ndata) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm\nfor BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions\nto basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time.

We\nintroduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle\nthat linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a\nhomothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When\nthis formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields\na generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the\nstandard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local\nscale.

Working paper (1st full draft); typos may exist", "summary": "In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms\ngenerate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared\nto the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being\nconsistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be\nimproved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in\nfeature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are\ncommonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,\nwithout any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that\neventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing\nportfolio.\n  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'\nreturns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as\nan independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such\na stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary\nprocesses fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a\nstrategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,\nmatching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly\ncriterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the\ntheoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as\nlong as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the\ngeneralized Kelly criterion in the experimental market.

The first contribution is the\nprojection of the residual to a finite-dimensional space and is therefore\ncomputable, while the second one can be reliably estimated by a computable\nupper bound in many practical scenarios. Assuming sufficiently accurate\nquadrature, our findings can be used to estimate the error of, e.g., neural\nnetwork outputs. Two important applications can be considered during\noptimization: first, the estimators are used to monitor the error in each\nsolver step, or, second, the two estimators are included in the loss\nfunctional, and therefore provide control over the error. As a model problem,\nwe consider a second-order elliptic partial differential equation and discuss\ndifferent variational formulations thereof, including several options to\ninclude boundary conditions in the estimators. Various numerical experiments\nare presented to validate our findings."}

We study\nboth static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit\n(MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller\nselects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share\nbalancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue.

While this\nhas recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open,\nand prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like\nobstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each\nbranching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude\nlarge complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete\nsubgraphs.\n  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather\ninvolved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like\ngraphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our\nconstruction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be\narbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and\n(c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has\ntreewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several\npreviously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most\none satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c)\nsimultaneously.\n  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that\nevery graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large\ncomplete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must\ncontain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction\nprovides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to\nhave arbitrarily large girth."}

Finally, we show that all thirteen possible\ninequalities among the three invariants, the $\\mathrm{v}$-number, the degree of\nthe $h$-polynomial, and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, can occur in the\ncase of edge ideals of connected graphs. Many of these examples rely on a\nminimal example of a graph whose $\\mathrm{v}$-number is more than the degree of\nits $h$-polynomial.
