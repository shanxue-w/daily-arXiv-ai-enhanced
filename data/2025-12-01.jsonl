The proposed method incorporates vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order convergence of the velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes."}

In this work, we develop a Bayesian risk-averse MPC framework for stochastic, discrete-time, nonlinear systems that provides theoretical guarantees on the consistency of Bayesian learning and closed-loop stability. First, we study Bayesian learning under the conditionally independent state transitions induced by feedback control and establish explicit conditions for Bayesian consistency on an infinitely countable parameter space. Second, we introduce a general notion of risk-averse asymptotic stability (RAAS), defined via comparison function classes and independent of any specific coherent risk measure or convergence rate, and we derive a risk-averse Lyapunov stability theorem together with MPC-specific stability conditions. Third, building on these foundations, we design a practical Bayesian risk-averse MPC scheme that separates epistemic (parametric) and aleatoric (disturbance) uncertainty: additive disturbances are treated in a risk-neutral fashion, while parametric uncertainty is managed via dynamically shrinking ambiguity sets constructed from Bayesian credible intervals, approximated online using particle filtering. To enable real-time implementation, we propose both an optimal and a sub-optimal receding-horizon control policy, the latter obtained by warm-starting from the previous solution, and prove that asymptotic RAAS is recovered as the Bayesian estimator becomes consistent."}

In higher dimensions, there are examples which are non-locally homogeneous with constant scalar curvature. Such examples were constructed by Kunduri-Lucietti as circle bundles over a compact Kähler-Einstein base. We then ask when compact quasi-Einstein metrics of constant scalar curvature can be constructed as circle bundles over Einstein metrics, and prove that the base must in fact be Kähler-Einstein, assuming a conjecture due to Goldberg.

Our contribution lies in establishing a rigorous methodology for characterizing system reliability under diverse propagation environments. Closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER) are derived by employing a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation of the spatially correlated UAV-to-user link, whose underlying independent diversity components are modeled as Nakagami-$m$ fading. This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments. This work provides both foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications."}

This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfracγ{2}[L,[L,ρ]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow.

As in the ideally exact case, ideally regular categories support a notion of ideal that classifies regular quotients. Moreover, they admit a characterisation in terms of monadicity over a homological category (rather than a semi-abelian one, as in the exact setting). Examples include Bourn protomodular quasivarieties of universal algebra in which 0 -> 1 is effective for descent (such as the category of torsion-free unital rings), all Bourn protomodular topological varieties with at least one constant (such as topological rings), and all semi-localisations of ideally exact categories."}

In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface."}

Our reconstruction procedure extracts geometric information solely from the asymptotic density and oscillatory structure of the ordered spectrum. The area $ab$ is obtained from the high-frequency Weyl slope, while the fundamental lengths $2a$ and $2b$ appear as dominant periodic--orbit contributions in the Fourier transform of the spectral fluctuations. This separation of smooth and oscillatory components yields a robust, offset-agnostic recovery of both side lengths.

Submitted to Statistica Sinica", "summary": "The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox stands as the most profound divergence between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing. Yet despite more than six decades of discussion, this paradox remains frequently misunderstood--even in the pages of leading statistical journals. In a 1993 paper published in Statistica Sinica, Robert characterized the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox as \"the fact that a point null hypothesis will always be accepted when the variance of a conjugate prior goes to infinity.\" This characterization, however, describes a different phenomenon entirely-what we term Bartlett's Anomaly-rather than the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox as originally formulated. The paradox, as presented by Lindley (1957), concerns what happens as sample size increases without bound while holding the significance level fixed, not what happens as prior variance diverges. This distinction is not merely terminological: the two phenomena have different mathematical structures, different implications, and require different solutions. The present paper aims to clarify this confusion, demonstrating through Lindley's own equations that he was concerned exclusively with sample size asymptotics. We show that even Jeffreys himself underestimated the practical frequency of the paradox. Finally, we argue that the only genuine resolution lies in abandoning point null hypotheses in favor of interval nulls, a paradigm shift that eliminates the paradox and restores harmony between Bayesian and frequentist inference.

This property was identified by P. T. Johnstone, following a question by A. Carboni and a suggestion by F. W. Lawvere, and it plays a central role in the characterization of naturally Mal'tsev categories. A broad and conceptually rich generalization emerges when the condition is formulated relative to a chosen class of spans. In this setting, the familiar Mal'tsev situation is recovered when the class consists of internal relations (that is, jointly monic spans) in which case the condition states that every internal reflexive relation is an equivalence relation. The purpose of this paper is to establish a comprehensive equivalence theorem that unifies the various categorical and diagrammatic formulations of the relative Lawvere condition. Furthermore, this formulation retains its significance even beyond the context of categories with finite limits, extending, for example, to categories admitting pullbacks of split epimorphisms along split epimorphisms. In addition to providing a fresh perspective on previously established results, we present a new characterization involving Janelidze-Pedicchio pseudogroupoids."}

To this end, first, we introduce new interval arithmetic operations. Under new operations, the space of interval numbers becomes a strict linear space, and indeed a Hilbert space, whereas the traditional interval arithmetic yields only a semilinear space with a defective algebraic structure. Secondly, by basing derivative and integral of interval-valued functions on the proposed operations, we retain every essential property of classical calculus while seamlessly incorporating ideas from the multiplicative calculus. The resulting unified hybrid framework eliminates the tedious case-by-case inspection of switching points required by the gH-derivative, leading to a markedly streamlined computational procedure. Finally, we establish an existence theorem for solutions of interval differential equations within the new calculus and corroborate its validity and practicality through representative examples. In contrast to the gH-derivative approach, the number of potential solutions does not explode doubly with additional switching points, ensuring robustness in both theory and computation."}

Math. Sci., 2015]. The time discretization is based on the IMEX strategy proposed in [Filbet, Jin, J. Sci. Comput., 2011] for the single-species BGK model and is here extended to the multi-species ES-BGK setting. The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation. The proposed approach can handle an arbitrary number of species. Its accuracy and robustness are demonstrated on a set of multidimensional kinetic tests for gas mixtures, where the AP property and the correct asymptotics are numerically verified across different regimes."}

For an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $μ= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $μ= 0$. Moreover, the associated $λ$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction.

We derive a functional version of the Feldman-H'ajek criterion and prove that equivalence of the Gaussian measures induced by two Hilbert-valued spherical fields is determined by a Hilbert summability condition involving Schoenberg functional sequences, extending classical results for scalar and vector fields to the infinite-dimensional setting. We further show how equivalence of all scalar projections is contained within, and dominated by, the functional criterion. The theory is illustrated through two models: (i) a multiquadratic bivariate family on $\\mathbb{S}^{d}$, where the equivalence region has a closed-form description in terms of cross-correlation and geodesic decay parameters, and (ii) an infinite-dimensional Legendre-Mat'ern construction, where operator-valued spectra yield identifiability conditions on smoothness and scale.

This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\\liminf a_n, \\limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure."}

To this end, a crucial step is the extension of the notion of an approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) to the case of matrix sequences with quaternion entries, since it allows us to decompose the difference between a matrix and its preconditioner into low-norm plus (relatively) low-rank terms.

This setting prevents the direct use of the proximal gradient (PG) method and its variants, and has motivated a growing body of research on new PG-type methods and their convergence theory, in particular, global convergence analysis without imposing any explicit or implicit boundedness assumptions on the iterates. Until recently, the first complete analysis of this kind has been established for the PG method and its specific nonmonotone variants, which has since stimulated further exploration along this research direction. In this paper, we consider a general composite optimization model beyond the global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. We propose a novel problem-parameter-free algorithm that incorporates a carefully designed nonmonotone line search to handle the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity, together with an extrapolation step to achieve potential acceleration. Despite the added technical challenges introduced by combining extrapolation with nonmonotone line search, we establish a refined convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under the Kurdyka-Ł ojasiewicz property, without requiring any boundedness assumptions on the iterates. This work thus further advances the theoretical understanding of PG-type methods in the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and highlight the advantages of integrating extrapolation with a nonmonotone line search."}

Szeszlér showed recently that if the digraph is acyclic, then the bases of this greedoid are the bases of a matroid.

The obtained presentations then gave rise to a concept of J-braid group, which coincides with the link groups of torus necklaces.\n  In this paper we study a generalization of J-groups. We determine which of these groups are finitely generated.

Their capability to enhance spatial resolution within a fixed physical aperture makes fluid antennas particularly attractive for next-generation wireless deployments. In this work, we focus on the beamforming problem using a two-dimensional planar fluid antenna array. Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. The resulting formulation transforms beam-pattern reconstruction into a sparse regression problem, which is addressed using a tailored compressive sensing algorithm designed to operate efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, to ensure physically consistent phase modeling in the desired beam, we introduce an iterative FFT-based phase retrieval method. Owing to its structure, the proposed phase-refinement procedure exhibits low computational complexity and rapid convergence, requiring only one FFT and one inverse FFT per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flexible beamforming framework. Compared with conventional fixed-array architectures, fluid antennas exhibit significantly improved beam-pattern reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their potential for high-resolution and adaptive beamforming in future wireless systems."}

We investigate properties of this procedure when applied to a general stationary processes possessing a spectral density with a dominant peak at some frequency $λ_0\\in(0,π)$. We show that if the peak of the spectral density is sharp enough (in a way to be specified) then the AR(2) model, which best (in mean square sense) approximates the underlying process, correctly identifies the frequency $λ_0$. To investigate consistency properties of the AR(2) based estimator of $λ_0$, a near to pole framework is adopted. Triangular arrays of stationary stochastic processes are considered that possess a spectral density the peak of which at $λ_0$ becomes more pronounced as the sample size $n$ of the observed time series increases to infinity. It is shown in this set up, that the AR(2) based estimator achieves a rate of convergence which is larger than the parametric $n^{-1/2}$ rate and which can be arbitrarily close to $ n^{-2/3}$, the best rate that can be achieved by this estimator."}

We first generate a family of block MDS codes over $\\F_2$ from punctured circulant permutation matrices. Second, we construct a family of block MDS LDPC codes from circulant matrices with column weight $> 1$ (CM$(t)$). Additionally, we present the Moore determinant formula for CM$(t)$s and a sufficient condition to avoid $4$-cycles in CM\\((t)\\)-QC LDPC codes' Tanner graphs for $t> 1$.

Building upon the Georgist distinction between produced value and unearned rent, the model departs from the static equilibrium tradition by introducing an explicit diffusion process for land values and a local investment dynamic governed by profitability thresholds. Land value $V (x, y, t)$ and built capital $K(x, y, t)$evolve over a two-dimensional urban domain according to coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, incorporating local productivity $A(x, y)$, centrality effects $μ(x, y)$, depreciation $δ$, and fiscal pressure $τ$ . Analytical characterization of the steady states reveals a transcritical bifurcation in the parameter $τ$ , separating inactive (low-investment) and active (self-sustaining) spatial regimes. The equilibrium pair $(V ^*, K^*)$ is shown to exist only when the effective decay rate $α= r + τ- μ(x, y)$ exceeds a profitability threshold $θ= κ+ δ/ I_0$, and becomes locally unstable beyond this boundary. The introduction of diffusion, $D_V ΔV$, stabilizes spatial dynamics and generates continuous gradients of land value and capital intensity, mitigating speculative clustering while preserving productive incentives. Numerical simulations confirm these analytical properties and display the emergence of spatially heterogeneous steady states driven by urban centrality and local productivity. The model also quantifies key aggregate outcomes, including dynamic tax revenues, adjusted capital-to-land ratios, and net present values under spatial heterogeneity and temporal discounting. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the main qualitative mechanisms-critical activation, spatial recomposition, and bifurcation structure-remain robust under alternative spatial profiles $(A, μ)$, discretization schemes, and moderate differentiation of the tax rate $τ(x, y)$. From an economic perspective, the results clarify the dual nature of the LVT: while it erodes unproductive rents and speculative land holding, its dynamic incidence on built capital depends on local profitability and financing constraints. The taxation parameter $τ$ thus acts as a control variable in a nonlinear spatial system, shaping transitions between rent-driven and production-driven equilibria. Within a critical range around $τ_c$, the LVT functions as an efficient spatial reallocation operator-reducing inequality in land values and investment density without impairing aggregate productivity. Beyond this range, excessive taxation induces systemic contraction and investment stagnation. Overall, this research bridges static urban tax theory with dynamic spatial economics by formalizing how a land-based fiscal instrument can reshape the geography of value creation through endogenous diffusion and nonlinear feedback. The framework provides a foundation for future extensions involving stochastic shocks, adaptive policy feedbacks, or endogenous public investment, offering a unified quantitative perspective on the dynamic efficiency and spatial equity of land value taxation."}

Traditional deterministic response planning models fail to represent key uncertainties, including variable spill magnitudes, changing environmental sensitivity, and infrastructure limitations. This study develops a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming framework that jointly optimizes the location of oil spill response stations and the allocation of heterogeneous resources across multiple probabilistic spill scenarios. The model integrates a weighted objective that combines spill volume, environmental sensitivity index (ESI), response time, and costs for station setup, deployment, and inter station transfer. Separate importance weights for coverage and cost, together with internal ecological weights, allow decision makers to balance ecological protection and operational efficiency. Data was compiled from Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation spill records and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ESI layers and are converted into model ready scenarios through harmonization and sampling. The model is solved with the Gurobi optimizer, and sensitivity analysis is performed over 324 combinations of importance and ecological weights. Results show about a 35.45% percent improvement in response effectiveness over deterministic methods, as confirmed by the value of the stochastic solution, and reveal clear tradeoffs between cost and ecological coverage. The framework provides a data driven decision support tool for Arctic emergency planners that simultaneously accounts for uncertainty, environmental sensitivity, and realistic logistical constraints."}

Specifically, I address cases in which newly learned information does not correspond to an event in the probability space defined on the sample space of outcomes. To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces.

Magan"], "title": "A generalization of the DHR theorem for higher form symmetries", "categories": ["hep-th", "math-ph"], "comment": "47 pages", "summary": "The Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) reconstruction theorem shows that standard ($0$-form) internal symmetries are associated to groups in relativistic quantum field theory in spacetime dimension $D>2$. In particular, non-invertible symmetry structures in $D>2$ correspond to the choice of a subtheory of a unique parent one, where the symmetry is a compact group. We present a theorem that generalizes this result to higher form symmetries. We first re-formulate the DHR theorem in terms of Haag duality violations (HDV) for regions with non-trivial homotopy group $π_0$ in the finite index case. In this light, the theorem states that the category associated with such HDV is the dual of a group, and it can be extended to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios. Then, after eliminating $π_0$ sectors via DHR reconstruction, we show that the HDV corresponding to regions with non-trivial $π_i$, $0<i<D-2$, are associated with abelian groups. Physically, the result shows that generalized order/disorder parameters in $D>2$ are labeled by such groups, in agreement with the case of confinement order parameters in Yang-Mills theories (Wilson and 't Hooft loops). For the special case of $D=4n$ and loops of dimension $k=2 n-1$, the group is further required to have a Hermitian character table. This does not rule out the possibility of an extra $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor that is not achievable by Lagrangian gauge models. In the way we find a new proof of the group-like origin of internal symmetries, and analyze the sectors for more general regions, e.g., direct sums, knots, and links. In particular, we find that generalized knot order parameters are classified by the unknot order parameters, and the commutator of knot non-local operators is determined by the linking number."}

While many advanced optimization techniques can be applied in a BD framework, one central technique has not been applied systematically in BD: symmetry handling. The main reason for this is that Benders cuts are not known explicitly but only generated via a separation oracle.\n  In this work, we close this gap by developing a theory of symmetry detection within the BD framework. To this end, we introduce a tailored family of graphs that capture the symmetry information of both the Benders master problem and the Benders oracles. Once symmetries of these graphs are known, which can be found by established techniques, classical symmetry handling approaches become available to accelerate BD. We complement these approaches by devising techniques for the separation and aggregation of symmetric Benders cuts by means of tailored separation routines and extended formulations. Both substantially reduce the number of executions of the separation oracles. In a numerical study, we show the effect of both symmetry handling and cut aggregation for bin packing and scheduling problems."}

Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors.

Bayesian sequential trial design relies primarily on conducting a Monte Carlo simulation under the hypotheses of interest and investigating the resulting design characteristics via Monte Carlo estimates. This approach has several drawbacks, namely that replicating the calibration of a Bayesian design requires repeating a possibly complex Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, Monte Carlo standard errors are required to judge the reliability of the simulation. All of this is due to a lack of closed-form or numerical approaches to calibrate a Bayesian design which uses Bayes factors. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian optimal two-stage design for clinical phase II trials based on Bayes factors. The optimal two-stage Bayes factor design is a sequential clinical trial design that is built on the idea of trinomial tree branching, a method we propose to correct the resulting design characteristics for introducing a single interim analysis. We build upon this idea to invent a calibration algorithm which yields the optimal Bayesian design that minimizes the expected sample size under the null hypothesis. Examples show that our design recovers Simon's two-stage optimal design as a special case, improves upon non-sequential Bayesian design based on Bayes factors, and can be calibrated quickly, as it makes use only of standard numerical techniques instead of time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the design allows to ensure a minimum probability on compelling evidence in favour of the null hypothesis, which is not possible with other designs. As the idea of trinomial tree branching is neither dependent on the endpoint, nor on the use of Bayes factors, the design can therefore be generalized to other settings, too."}

The proposed method is based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition methodology and achieves optimal convergence orders under minimal structural assumptions on the coefficients. A key feature of our approach is the careful design of so-called quantities of interest, defining functionals of the solution whose values the multiscale approximation aims to reproduce exactly. Their selection is particularly delicate in the context of Stokes problems due to potential conflicts arising from the divergence-free constraint. We prove the exponential decay of the problem-adapted basis functions, justifying their localized computation in practical implementations. A rigorous a priori error analysis proves high-order convergence for both velocity and pressure, if the basis supports grow logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings."}

We give an alternative way how to calculate the inner products of functions from this system and discuss the spectral properties of the Gram matrix generated by this system. The univariate system was later generalized to the multivariate setting by two of the authors of this work. Instead of the usual tensor product construction, this generalization relied on the inner products inside of the argument of the univariate sequence. It turned out that such a system forms a Riesz basis of $L_2(0,1)^n$ for every $n\\ge 1$ with Riesz constants independent of $n$. In this work, we investigate the properties of these new sequences of functions in $L_q(0,1)^n$ for $q\\not =2.$ First, we show that the univariate system is a Schauder basis in $L_q(0,1)$ for every $1<q<\\infty$. By a general argument, it follows that the tensor products of this system also form a Schauder basis in $L_q(0,1)^n$ for every $n\\ge 2$ and $1<q<\\infty.$ The same fact can also be shown by measuring the distance of the tensor product system to the classical multivariate Fourier basis, but - surprisingly - this argument only works for $n\\le 3$.

In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations."}

Recently, neural network-based decoders have emerged as promising tools for enhancing ECC reliability, yet their high computational complexity prevents their potential practical deployment. In this paper, we take a different approach and design a neural transmission scheme that employs the transformer architecture in order to improve the reliability of existing ECCs. We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length >64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity). The results establish TransCoder as a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices."}

We analyze fundamental invertibility and admissibility properties of our calculi and introduce a novel structural rule, called the shift rule, which unifies standard structural rules arising from modal frame conditions into a single rule. This rule enables a purely syntactic proof of cut-admissibility that is uniform over all IGLs, and yields completeness of our nested calculi as a corollary. Finally, we define an interpolation algorithm that operates over single-conclusioned nested sequent proofs. This gives constructive proofs of both the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and Beth definability property (BDP) for all IGLs and for all intuitionistic modal and tense logics they subsume.

More precisely, variational approaches apply to the study of Bellman equation as a parabolic quasi-linear equation, when the nonlinearity affects only the gradient of the solution, and the second order derivative term is linear and not degenerate. This corresponds to a stochastic control problem, where the state equation is a diffusion process. The primary objective of this article is to extend this approach to mean field control theory, as an alternative to the current approach, which considers a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and Fokker-Planck (FP) equations, since the introduction of the theory by Lasry-Lions (2007). The main novelty lies in that the equation studied here is the HJB equation, neither the HJ-FP system nor the master equation; and our results also provide another perspective for probabilistic approaches; see Chassagneux-Crisan-Delarue (2022), Bensoussan-Wong-Yam-Yuan (2024), Bensoussan-Tai-Yam (2025) and Bensoussan-Huang-Tang-Yam (2025) for instance. Within the scope of the PDE methods, the advantage of this article is to solve a larger class of mean field control problems, with moderate regularity; and this kind of variational methods fairly require few conditions on the regularity of the coefficients."}

The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties."}

More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\\in\\cal Y$, we have $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq ε$. In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \\leq r$. Finally, $Y$ satisfies the point-wise bounded statistical parity constraint $χ^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq ε$. When $ε$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information. To design the representation $Y$, we utilize this approximation and show that the main complex fairness design problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has simple closed-form solution under certain constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity.

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets."}

Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams. Simulations validate the superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training."}

In doing so, we also establish an explicit Hildebrand inequality for smooth polynomials in short intervals, a function field form of Shiu's theorem for multiplicative functions, and an explicit Chebyshev bound for rough polynomials in short intervals."}

Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$.

To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy.

This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $η$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification.

Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection. Through numerical experiments for MRSW moment systems up to third-order, we demonstrate that these moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency."}

Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations."}

Preserving these conservation and dissipation laws on discretisation in time can yield vastly better approximations for the same computational effort, compared to schemes that are not structure-preserving. In this work we present two novel contributions: (i) an arbitrary-order time discretisation for general conservative ordinary differential equations that conserves all known invariants and (ii) an energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for both ordinary and partial differential equations written in the GENERIC format, a superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems. In both cases the underlying strategy is the same: the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables, allowing for the replication at the discrete level of the proofs of conservation or dissipation. We illustrate the advantages of our approximations with numerical examples of the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, a combustion engine model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation."}

In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied."}

Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition. In addition, we provide a complete characterization of all minimal optimal measurements when one state is pure, leveraging geometric insights from the Bloch-sphere representation.

Both networks share a unified physics residual while being softly specialized via distance-weighted priors ($w_{\\text{bd}} = \\exp(-d/τ)$) that are cosine-annealed during training. Boundary conditions are enforced through an augmented Lagrangian method, eliminating manual penalty tuning. Training proceeds in two phases: Phase~1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles and stabilize boundary satisfaction; Phase~2 employs focused sampling (e.g. ring sampling near $\\partialΩ$) with annealed role weights to efficiently resolve localized features. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the 1D Fokker-Planck equation, the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, and the 1D wave equation. Across Laplace and Poisson benchmarks, our method reduces error by $36-90\\%$, improves boundary satisfaction by $21-88\\%$, and decreases MAE by $2.2-9.3\\times$ relative to a single-network PINN.

In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\\mathfrak{g}^{\\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(ξ,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfracγ{2}[L,[L,ρ]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input."}

We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations.

For this modified model, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a non-trivial QSD that assigns positive probability to all transient states, and then derive an explicit formula for this QSD in terms of paths and transition rates. We also discuss the ratio of expectations distribution as an alternative approach to describe the long-term behavior before absorption. The analysis is further extended to the Daley--Kendall rumor model and the stochastic SIR epidemic model."}

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs."}

However, to estimate the infidelity $ε$ with multiplicative precision, conventional estimation protocols require (order) $1/ε^2$ different circuits in addition to $1/ε^2$ samples, which is quite resource-intensive for high-precision fidelity estimation. Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/ε$ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $ε$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation."}

The review begins with early parameterized models and progresses to contemporary third-generation models, which solve the wave action conservation equation with few spectral constraints. A comparison of the models' efficiency, accuracy in nearshore conditions, ability to resolve nonlinear wave-wave interaction, simulate wave breaking, diffraction, and wave-current interactions is provided. Applications in operational forecasting, extreme event simulation, coastal structure design, and assessing climate change impacts are discussed. The validation of these models and the statistical metrics and intercomparison studies used are addressed.

In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations."}

Classification variables can be expressed by means of a categorical scale which, at best, is ordinal. Because ordinal data lack a natural metric structure in their underlying space, most conventional distance measures aimed at assessing the accuracy of machine learning classifications cannot be directly or meaningfully applied. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for comparing ordinal data based on a family of Rank Graduation $(\\mathrm{RGX}_p)$ \\emph{metrics}. We demonstrate that these metrics can quantify the proportion of variability of the response explained by the predictions, in a similar manner as the predictive $R^2$ for continuous response variables. After establishing theoretical connections between the $\\mathrm{RGX}_p$ family and other prominent metrics in AI, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse datasets and learning tasks to evaluate their empirical performance. The results underscore the versatility, interpretability, and robustness of the $\\mathrm{RGX}_p$ metrics as a principled foundation for developing trustworthy and SAFE AI systems."}

By employing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a distribution-free risk metric, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which combines a surrogate model for efficient deployment with an alternating optimization (AO) scheme for robust real-time beamforming.

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics."}

Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations.

However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL."}

Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity."}

In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields.

In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \\emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \\emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks."}

In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.\n  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time \"tails\", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions."}

The method defines a relative completion within the union space $X_0 \\cup X_1$, yielding a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between the $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics. While we do not compare this method to the previously developed approaches nor explore its correspondence with classical interpolation functors in normed spaces, the construction enriches the set of tools available for metric-space interpolation theory.

In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems."}

In this model, a data-poor verifier determines whether a probability distribution has a property of interest by interacting with an all-powerful, data-rich but untrusted prover bent on convincing them that it has the property. While prior work gave sample-, time-, and communication-efficient protocols for testing and estimating a range of distribution properties, they all suffer from an inherent issue: for most interesting properties of distributions over a domain of size $N$, the verifier must draw at least $Ω(\\sqrt{N})$ samples of its own. While sublinear in $N$, this is still prohibitive for large domains encountered in practice.\n  In this work, we circumvent this limitation by augmenting the verifier with the ability to perform an exponentially smaller number of more powerful (but reasonable) \\emph{pairwise conditional} queries, effectively enabling them to perform ``local comparison checks'' of the prover's claims. We systematically investigate the landscape of interactive proofs in this new setting, giving polylogarithmic query and sample protocols for (tolerantly) testing all \\emph{label-invariant} properties, thus demonstrating exponential savings without compromising on communication, for this large and fundamental class of testing tasks."}

This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions."}

Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ time steps suffice.\n  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement.

While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting."}

We study complexity aspects of several problems related to the cores of ordered graphs. Interestingly, they exhibit a different behavior than their unordered counterparts. We show that the retraction problem, i.e., deciding whether a given graph admits an ordered-preserving homomorphism to its specific subgraph, can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, it is \\NP-hard to decide whether a given ordered graph is a core. In fact, we show that it is even \\NP-hard to distinguish graphs $G$ whose core is largest possible (i.e., if $G$ is a core) from those, whose core is the smallest possible, i.e., its size is equal to the ordered chromatic number of $G$.

For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \\emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed."}
