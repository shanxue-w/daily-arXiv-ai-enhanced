Furthermore, since\nappropriate project management is subject to the innate uncertainties involved\nin most projects, they are required to be appraised respecting their profound\nimpact. In this paper, a new comprehensive multi-mode multi-objective linear\nprogramming model with two conflicting objectives, which are maximizing final\ncash flow for profit optimization and shortening the duration of project\nexecution, considering improving assumptions, that is, payments delays, project\nfinance constraints, initial capital, different types of interest rates, credit\nlimit to assuage financial distress, credit line usage, is presented in an\nuncertain environment. Since the model is considered as multi-objective with\nuncertain parameters, a new extended interval valued fuzzy - Torabi and Hassini\n(IVF-TH) approach is proposed to tackle the problem. The presented mixed\ninteger linear programming (MILP) model is solved applying CPLEX solver. In\naddition, a real construction project in oil and gas industry is presented as a\ncase study to illustrate the model applications. Ultimately, for the purpose of\nassessing the outcomes, a sensitivity analysis is implemented, and the\nperformance of the proposed solution approach is compared to the previous\nmulti-objective optimization methods using both case study and large problem\ninstances."}

The existing shrinking methods such as Lasso-type estimation can not\nsuitably reveal such property. A new method recently suggested, called by {\\it\nsignal lasso} (or its updating version: adaptive signal lasso) was proposed to\nsolve the network reconstruction problem, where the signal parameter can be\nshrunk to either 0 or 1 in two different directions. The signal lasso or\nadaptive signal lasso employed the additive penalty of signal and non-signal\nterms which is a convex function and easily to complementation in computation.\nHowever their methods need tuning the one or two parameters to find an optimal\nsolution, which is time cost for large size network. In this paper we propose\nnew signal lasso method based on two penalty functions to estimate the signal\nparameter and uncovering network topology in complex network with a small\namount of observations. The penalty functions we introduced are non-convex\nfunction, thus coordinate descent algorithms are suggested. We find in this\nmethod the tuning parameter can be set to a large enough values such that the\nsignal parameter can be completely shrunk either 0 or 1. The extensive\nsimulations are conducted in linear regression models with different\nassumptions, the evolutionary-game-based dynamic model and Kuramoto model of\nsynchronization problem. The advantage and disadvantage of each method are\nfully discussed in various conditions. Finally a real example comes from\nbehavioral experiment is used for illustration.

Numerical testing suggests that\ncyclic-by-row is more efficient. Then we discuss two different methods of\northogonalizing an almost orthogonal matrix: the QR factorization and the polar\ndecomposition. For polar decomposition, we speed up the Newton iteration by\nusing the one-step Schulz iteration. Based on numerical testing, using the\npolar decomposition approach (Newton--Schulz iteration) is not only faster but\nalso more accurate than using the QR factorization.\n  A mixed precision algorithm for computing the spectral decomposition of a\nreal symmetric matrix at double precision is provided. In doing so we compute\nthe approximate eigenvector matrix $Q_\\ell$ of $A$ in single precision using\n$\\texttt{eig}$ and $\\texttt{single}$ in MATLAB.

We show that, in\ncharacteristic 0, the shifted tangent bundle of the orbifold inertia stack is\nequivalent to the free loop space. This yields an explicit HKR equivalence\nbetween Hochschild homology and differential forms on the orbifold inertia\nstack, as algebras. We also construct a stacky filtered circle, leading to a\nfiltration on the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack whose associated\ngraded complex recovers the de Rham theory of its orbifold inertia stack. This\nprovides a generalization of recent work of Moulinos-Robalo-To\\\"en to the\nsetting of derived DM stacks."}

Existing works in\nthe literature mostly focus on linear regression with hidden variables.\nHowever, when the regression model is non-linear, the presence of hidden\nvariables leads to new challenges in parameter identification, estimation, and\nstatistical inference. This paper studies multivariate response generalized\nlinear models (GLMs) with hidden variables. We propose a unified framework for\nparameter estimation and statistical inference called G-HIVE, short for\n'G'eneralized - 'HI'dden 'V'ariable adjusted 'E'stimation. Specifically, based\non factor model assumptions, we propose a modified quasi-likelihood approach to\nestimate an intermediate parameter, defined through a set of reweighted\nestimating equations. The key of our approach is to construct the proper\nweight, so that the first-order asymptotic bias of the estimator can be removed\nby orthogonal projection. Moreover, we propose an approximate inference\nframework for uncertainty quantification. Theoretically, we establish the\nfirst-order and second-order asymptotic bias and the convergence rate of our\nestimator. In addition, we characterize the accuracy of the Gaussian\napproximation of our estimator via the Berry-Esseen bound, which justifies the\nvalidity of the proposed approximate inference approach. Extensive simulations\nand real data analysis results show that G-HIVE is feasibly implementable and\ncan outperform the baseline method that ignores hidden variables."}

Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including\ndiffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to\n$10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees\nof freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case,\nthe low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\\times$ over its full-rank\ncounterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated\nand multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our\nknowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for\nmultidimensional steady-state RTE."}

As a corollary, assuming a stronger\nLyapunov structure, our main result yields a sharp exponential rate of\nconvergence to equilibrium for $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ in a weighted total\nvariation norm.

Ferber and Krivelevich (Adv. Math., 2022) confirmed the\nconjecture. In this short paper, we generalize this result by considering $G$\nwith vertices labeled 0 or 1 and requiring that in an induced subgraph of $G$,\nthe 0-labeled vertices are of even degree and the 1-labeled vertices are of odd\ndegree. We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, it contains such a\nsubgraph of order linear in $n$.\n  The well-known Gallai's Theorem states that the vertices of each graph can be\npartitioned into two parts such that all vertices in the subgraphs induced by\nthe two parts have even degrees.

The concept of the\nradial epiderivative constitutes a distinct generalization of classical\nderivative notions, as it replaces the conventional limit operation with an\ninfimum-based construction. This formulation permits the analysis of\ndirectional behavior without invoking standard neighborhood-based assumptions\nand constructions commonly required in generalized differentiation. This leads\nto one of the key advantages of the radial epiderivative which lies in its\napplicability even to discrete domains, where classical and generalized\nderivatives are often inapplicable or undefined. The other advantage of this\nconcept is that it provides a possibility to inverstigate KKT conditions for\nglobal minimums. Consequently, this approach necessitates a reformulation of\nfundamental analytical tools such as gradient vectors, feasible direction sets,\nconstraint qualifications and other concepts which are central to the\nderivation of optimality conditions in smooth optimization theory.

This scheduling problem is a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function.

An intrusion detection system\n(IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security\nmanagement. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent\ntwo-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power\nthe system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion\ndetection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection\naccuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for\nintrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase,\nthe Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection.\nIn the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to\ndetect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset\nwas used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method\nimproves accuracy compared to other approaches."}

We describe explicitly the\ncomplexified tangent space for each of the models, as well as the\ndiffeomorphisms between them and their differentials.\n  In an application of this theory, we introduce alternative notions of\npolystable Higgs bundles that can be used for the study of fundamental group\nrepresentations into symplectic or into indefinite orthogonal groups over\nHermitian involutive algebras. We characterize solutions to the relevant\nharmonicity equations with respect to these new models of the symmetric space.\nReductive fundamental group representations then correspond to holomorphic\npairs written with regard to these geometric incarnations of the associated\nsymmetric space, thus allowing new insights for their study."}

This approach contrasts\nwith Witsenhausen's original two-point strategy, which instead designs the\nsystem state itself to be a binary step. While the two-point strategy can\noutperform the linear strategy in estimation cost, it, along with its\nmulti-step extensions, typically requires a substantial power budget. Analogous\nto Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) communication for Gaussian channels, we\nshow that the binary LoPE strategy attains first-order optimality in the\nlow-power regime, matching the performance of the linear strategy as the power\nbudget increases from zero. Our analysis also provides an interpretation of the\npreviously observed near-optimal sloped step function (\"sawtooth\") structure to\nthe Witsenhausen counterexample: In the low-power regime, power saving is\nprioritized, in which case the LoPE strategy dominates, making the system state\na piecewise linear function with slope close to one.

We propose\naveraged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for\nnumerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization\nused in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that\nenables conversion between different schedules at inference time without\nretraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules\nachieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear\nschedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step\nsampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant\ndistributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations,\ndemonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions."}

This framework is used for designing optimized\nreinforcements for masonry structures aimed at improving the structural\ncapacity, but without substantial changes in the typical behavior of masonry\nstructural systems, since the reinforcement layout leaves the possibility of\ncracks opening. Therefore, both rocking motions and adaptation to support\nsettlements remain allowed, and the transmission of too high forces to the\nunreinforced structural elements supporting the reinforced one is prevented.\nThis way, a new strengthening strategy, called \"weak reinforcement\" approach is\nobtained. This strategy pursues the challenging goal of combining structural\nsafety and conservation for architectural heritage: indeed, not only the\nhistorical masonry is preserved as much as possible, but also the original\nspecial \"masonry-like\" behavior. The design, in principle, of optimized\nstrengthening intervention through the weak reinforcement approach is\nexemplified through the application to a trilithon under seismic loads and to\nan arch under a concentrated load.

In this\ncontext, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.\nWe encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit\n(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with\na second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled\nexpectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by\nminimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second\nPQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients\nof the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are\nupdated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal\nvariables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them\nto be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system\nusing Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational\nquantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions.

Traditional approaches typically solve the maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) problem using gradient-based methods, which are\nsensitive to step-size selection and initialization, and may therefore suffer\nfrom slow or unstable convergence. In contrast, we propose a novel estimation\nstrategy that reformulates these models as conic optimization problems,\nenabling more robust and reliable estimation procedures. Specifically, we show\nthat the MLE for MNL admits an equivalent exponential cone program (ECP). For\nNL and TNL, we prove that when the dissimilarity (scale) parameters are fixed,\nthe estimation problem is convex and likewise reducible to an ECP. Leveraging\nthese results, we design a two-stage procedure: an outer loop that updates the\nscale parameters and an inner loop that solves the ECP to update the utility\ncoefficients. The inner problems are handled by interior-point methods with\niteration counts that grow only logarithmically in the target accuracy, as\nimplemented in off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., MOSEK). Extensive experiments\nacross estimation instances of varying size show that our conic approach\nattains better MLE solutions, greater robustness to initialization, and\nsubstantial speedups compared to standard gradient-based MLE, particularly on\nlarge-scale instances with high-dimensional specifications and large choice\nsets. Our findings establish exponential cone programming as a practical and\nscalable alternative for estimating a broad class of discrete choice models."}

Alternatively, scanning\nthe x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time\nand increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally\nimportant. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics\nof the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting\nregions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for\nraster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter\noptimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by\nreconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this\napproach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a\nlarge dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose\nleveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on\nregions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct\ndetails in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning\nprocess and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining\nhigh-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned\nimage. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a\nscore function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs,\nand (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to\nan optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning\npath between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently\napply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the\nnext scan iteration."}

To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the\nprincipal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka\nInformation Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all\nthese cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the\nprincipal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We\nstudy information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games\nand quadratic Gaussian game setups."}

We show that such algorithms\ncan be modified to reuse the randomness used to query the input across\nsub-problems. Consequently, we improve the trade-off between the number of\ngradient (full batch) and individual function (sample) queries for finite sum\nminimization, the number of matrix-vector multiplies (full batch) and random\nrow (sample) queries for top-eigenvector computation, and the number of\nmatrix-vector multiplies with the transition matrix (full batch) and generative\nmodel (sample) queries for optimizing Markov Decision Processes. To facilitate\nour analysis we introduce the notion of pseudo-independent algorithms, a\ngeneralization of pseudo-deterministic algorithms [Gat and Goldwasser 2011],\nthat quantifies how independent the output of a randomized algorithm is from a\nrandomness source."}

We develop\na new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates\nfor the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity\nand approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic\nreinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be\nachieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees."}
