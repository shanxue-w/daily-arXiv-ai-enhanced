Furthermore, since\nappropriate project management is subject to the innate uncertainties involved\nin most projects, they are required to be appraised respecting their profound\nimpact. In this paper, a new comprehensive multi-mode multi-objective linear\nprogramming model with two conflicting objectives, which are maximizing final\ncash flow for profit optimization and shortening the duration of project\nexecution, considering improving assumptions, that is, payments delays, project\nfinance constraints, initial capital, different types of interest rates, credit\nlimit to assuage financial distress, credit line usage, is presented in an\nuncertain environment. Since the model is considered as multi-objective with\nuncertain parameters, a new extended interval valued fuzzy - Torabi and Hassini\n(IVF-TH) approach is proposed to tackle the problem. The presented mixed\ninteger linear programming (MILP) model is solved applying CPLEX solver. In\naddition, a real construction project in oil and gas industry is presented as a\ncase study to illustrate the model applications. Ultimately, for the purpose of\nassessing the outcomes, a sensitivity analysis is implemented, and the\nperformance of the proposed solution approach is compared to the previous\nmulti-objective optimization methods using both case study and large problem\ninstances."}

The existing shrinking methods such as Lasso-type estimation can not\nsuitably reveal such property. A new method recently suggested, called by {\\it\nsignal lasso} (or its updating version: adaptive signal lasso) was proposed to\nsolve the network reconstruction problem, where the signal parameter can be\nshrunk to either 0 or 1 in two different directions. The signal lasso or\nadaptive signal lasso employed the additive penalty of signal and non-signal\nterms which is a convex function and easily to complementation in computation.\nHowever their methods need tuning the one or two parameters to find an optimal\nsolution, which is time cost for large size network. In this paper we propose\nnew signal lasso method based on two penalty functions to estimate the signal\nparameter and uncovering network topology in complex network with a small\namount of observations. The penalty functions we introduced are non-convex\nfunction, thus coordinate descent algorithms are suggested. We find in this\nmethod the tuning parameter can be set to a large enough values such that the\nsignal parameter can be completely shrunk either 0 or 1. The extensive\nsimulations are conducted in linear regression models with different\nassumptions, the evolutionary-game-based dynamic model and Kuramoto model of\nsynchronization problem. The advantage and disadvantage of each method are\nfully discussed in various conditions. Finally a real example comes from\nbehavioral experiment is used for illustration.

Numerical testing suggests that\ncyclic-by-row is more efficient. Then we discuss two different methods of\northogonalizing an almost orthogonal matrix: the QR factorization and the polar\ndecomposition. For polar decomposition, we speed up the Newton iteration by\nusing the one-step Schulz iteration. Based on numerical testing, using the\npolar decomposition approach (Newton--Schulz iteration) is not only faster but\nalso more accurate than using the QR factorization.\n  A mixed precision algorithm for computing the spectral decomposition of a\nreal symmetric matrix at double precision is provided. In doing so we compute\nthe approximate eigenvector matrix $Q_\\ell$ of $A$ in single precision using\n$\\texttt{eig}$ and $\\texttt{single}$ in MATLAB.

We show that, in\ncharacteristic 0, the shifted tangent bundle of the orbifold inertia stack is\nequivalent to the free loop space. This yields an explicit HKR equivalence\nbetween Hochschild homology and differential forms on the orbifold inertia\nstack, as algebras. We also construct a stacky filtered circle, leading to a\nfiltration on the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack whose associated\ngraded complex recovers the de Rham theory of its orbifold inertia stack. This\nprovides a generalization of recent work of Moulinos-Robalo-To\\\"en to the\nsetting of derived DM stacks."}

Existing works in\nthe literature mostly focus on linear regression with hidden variables.\nHowever, when the regression model is non-linear, the presence of hidden\nvariables leads to new challenges in parameter identification, estimation, and\nstatistical inference. This paper studies multivariate response generalized\nlinear models (GLMs) with hidden variables. We propose a unified framework for\nparameter estimation and statistical inference called G-HIVE, short for\n'G'eneralized - 'HI'dden 'V'ariable adjusted 'E'stimation. Specifically, based\non factor model assumptions, we propose a modified quasi-likelihood approach to\nestimate an intermediate parameter, defined through a set of reweighted\nestimating equations. The key of our approach is to construct the proper\nweight, so that the first-order asymptotic bias of the estimator can be removed\nby orthogonal projection. Moreover, we propose an approximate inference\nframework for uncertainty quantification. Theoretically, we establish the\nfirst-order and second-order asymptotic bias and the convergence rate of our\nestimator. In addition, we characterize the accuracy of the Gaussian\napproximation of our estimator via the Berry-Esseen bound, which justifies the\nvalidity of the proposed approximate inference approach. Extensive simulations\nand real data analysis results show that G-HIVE is feasibly implementable and\ncan outperform the baseline method that ignores hidden variables."}

Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including\ndiffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to\n$10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees\nof freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case,\nthe low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\\times$ over its full-rank\ncounterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated\nand multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our\nknowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for\nmultidimensional steady-state RTE."}

As a corollary, assuming a stronger\nLyapunov structure, our main result yields a sharp exponential rate of\nconvergence to equilibrium for $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ in a weighted total\nvariation norm.

Ferber and Krivelevich (Adv. Math., 2022) confirmed the\nconjecture. In this short paper, we generalize this result by considering $G$\nwith vertices labeled 0 or 1 and requiring that in an induced subgraph of $G$,\nthe 0-labeled vertices are of even degree and the 1-labeled vertices are of odd\ndegree. We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, it contains such a\nsubgraph of order linear in $n$.\n  The well-known Gallai's Theorem states that the vertices of each graph can be\npartitioned into two parts such that all vertices in the subgraphs induced by\nthe two parts have even degrees.

The concept of the\nradial epiderivative constitutes a distinct generalization of classical\nderivative notions, as it replaces the conventional limit operation with an\ninfimum-based construction. This formulation permits the analysis of\ndirectional behavior without invoking standard neighborhood-based assumptions\nand constructions commonly required in generalized differentiation. This leads\nto one of the key advantages of the radial epiderivative which lies in its\napplicability even to discrete domains, where classical and generalized\nderivatives are often inapplicable or undefined. The other advantage of this\nconcept is that it provides a possibility to inverstigate KKT conditions for\nglobal minimums. Consequently, this approach necessitates a reformulation of\nfundamental analytical tools such as gradient vectors, feasible direction sets,\nconstraint qualifications and other concepts which are central to the\nderivation of optimality conditions in smooth optimization theory.

This scheduling problem is a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function.

Detecting unwanted activities\nwithin the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental\nresearch area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system\n(IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security\nmanagement. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent\ntwo-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power\nthe system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion\ndetection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection\naccuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for\nintrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase,\nthe Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection.\nIn the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to\ndetect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset\nwas used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method\nimproves accuracy compared to other approaches."}

While the two-point strategy can\noutperform the linear strategy in estimation cost, it, along with its\nmulti-step extensions, typically requires a substantial power budget. Analogous\nto Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) communication for Gaussian channels, we\nshow that the binary LoPE strategy attains first-order optimality in the\nlow-power regime, matching the performance of the linear strategy as the power\nbudget increases from zero. Our analysis also provides an interpretation of the\npreviously observed near-optimal sloped step function (\"sawtooth\") structure to\nthe Witsenhausen counterexample: In the low-power regime, power saving is\nprioritized, in which case the LoPE strategy dominates, making the system state\na piecewise linear function with slope close to one.

As part of this study, we introduce the notion of $C_Q$-visible sets,\ndefined with respect to a selected subset $Q$ of vertices in a graph $G$. A\n$C_Q$-visible set is a collection of vertices in $\\overline{Q}$ that is not\nonly $Q$-visible, but also individually visible from each vertex in $Q$. Using\nthis concept, we establish several characterizations and properties of\nmutual-visibility sets within the corona product, thereby providing deeper\ninsights into their structure and behavior."}

The stability rule generates a class of $\\textit{probabilistically\nstable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that\nresult from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning\nwhile complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In\nthis paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete\ncharacterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and\nprovides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic)\nlogic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of\ncomparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a selection function to be representable as a\nstrongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting\nlogic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity\nproperties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only\nvery weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two\nresults of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the\nfirst provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation\nof a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability\norders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio\ncomparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than\nevent $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point\nout two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games\nand to revealed preference theory."}

This framework is used for designing optimized\nreinforcements for masonry structures aimed at improving the structural\ncapacity, but without substantial changes in the typical behavior of masonry\nstructural systems, since the reinforcement layout leaves the possibility of\ncracks opening. Therefore, both rocking motions and adaptation to support\nsettlements remain allowed, and the transmission of too high forces to the\nunreinforced structural elements supporting the reinforced one is prevented.\nThis way, a new strengthening strategy, called \"weak reinforcement\" approach is\nobtained. This strategy pursues the challenging goal of combining structural\nsafety and conservation for architectural heritage: indeed, not only the\nhistorical masonry is preserved as much as possible, but also the original\nspecial \"masonry-like\" behavior.

In this\ncontext, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.\nWe encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit\n(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with\na second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled\nexpectations of quantum observables.

Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains\nmolecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,\nthereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing\nmolecular clusters. Our results underscore the utility of optimal transport\ntheory for molecular alignment and offer a generalizable framework applicable\nto structural comparison tasks in cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and\nrelated disciplines."}

Alternatively, scanning\nthe x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time\nand increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally\nimportant. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics\nof the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting\nregions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for\nraster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter\noptimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by\nreconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this\napproach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a\nlarge dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose\nleveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on\nregions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct\ndetails in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning\nprocess and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining\nhigh-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we\nintroduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned\nimage. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a\nscore function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs,\nand (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to\nan optimal set.

Then, we introduce an inner\nfeedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As\nfar as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load\nestimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the\ninsertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire\ncontrol system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures\nbased on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC\nin terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are\ndiscussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we\npresent experimental results obtained through the implementation of the\nproposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed\napproach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect\nto the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters."}

In each period, the decision-maker\nobserves the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a\nreward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a\nbounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only\nlimited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose\nthe AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance\nclose to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving\nclassical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our\nframework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time\nquotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation\nof reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad\napplicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making."}

It\nis well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an\nagent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic\nstudy of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games.\nSpecifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to\ndecrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the\nprincipal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka\nInformation Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all\nthese cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the\nprincipal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We\nstudy information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games\nand quadratic Gaussian game setups."}

Consequently, we improve the trade-off between the number of\ngradient (full batch) and individual function (sample) queries for finite sum\nminimization, the number of matrix-vector multiplies (full batch) and random\nrow (sample) queries for top-eigenvector computation, and the number of\nmatrix-vector multiplies with the transition matrix (full batch) and generative\nmodel (sample) queries for optimizing Markov Decision Processes.
