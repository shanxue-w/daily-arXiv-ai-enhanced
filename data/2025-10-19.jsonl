However, even rare silent data corruption (SDC) can flip a few\nring coefficients and cascade through downstream arithmetic. Conventional\ndefenses are ill-matched to current low-latency pipelines:\ndetect-and-retransmit adds RTTs, while byte-stream ECC ignores the algebraic\nstructure and forces format conversions. To that end, we propose a\nstructure-preserving reliability layer that operates in the encoded data's\noriginal polynomial ring, adds a small amount of systematic redundancy, and\ncorrects symbol errors/flagged erasures without round-trip or format changes.\nWe construct two complementary schemes: one for odd length $N_{odd}$ via a\nHensel-lifted BCH ideal with an idempotent encoder, and one for power-of-two\nlength $N_{2^m}$ via a repeated-root negacyclic code with derivative-style\ndecoding. In particular, to stay robust against clustered errors, a ring\nautomorphism provides in-place interleaving to disperse bursts. Implementation\nwise, on four frame sizes $N\\!=\\!1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$, we meet a per-frame\nfailure target of $10^{-9}$ at symbol error rates $10^{-6}\\text{--}10^{-5}$\nwith $t\\!=\\!8\\text{--}9$, incurring only $0.20\\%\\text{--}1.56\\%$ overhead and\ntolerating $\\sim\\!32\\text{--}72$\\,B unknown-error bursts (roughly doubled when\nflagged as erasures) after interleaving.

However,\nsolving the KS chemotaxis system and generating its aggregation patterns remain\nchallenging due to the emergence of solutions exhibiting near-singular\nbehavior, such as finite-time blow-up or concentration phenomena. Building on a\nLagrangian framework of the KS system, we develop DeepLagrangian, a\nself-adaptive density estimation method that learns and generates aggregation\npatterns and near-singular solutions of the KS system in two- and\nthree-dimensional (2D and 3D) space under different physical parameters. The\nmain advantage of the Lagrangian framework is its inherent ability to adapt to\nnear-singular solutions. To develop this framework, we normalize the KS\nsolution into a probability density function (PDF), derive the corresponding\nnormalized KS system, and utilize the property of the continuity equation to\nrewrite the system into a Lagrangian framework. We then define a\nphysics-informed Lagrangian loss to enforce this framework and incorporate a\nflow-based generative model, called the time-dependent KRnet, to approximate\nthe PDF by minimizing the loss. Furthermore, we integrate time-marching\nstrategies with the time-dependent KRnet to enhance the accuracy of the PDF\napproximation. After obtaining the approximate PDF, we recover the original KS\nsolution. We also prove that the Lagrangian loss effectively controls the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate PDF and the exact PDF.\nIn the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy of our DeepLagrangian\nmethod for the 2D and 3D KS chemotaxis system with/without advection."}

This has motivated the\ndevelopment of specialized algorithms that take advantage of the structure of\nsome MINLPs to improve their tractability. In this work, we propose the\nMixed-integer Smoothing Surrogate Optimization with Constraints (MiSSOC)\napproach, a novel optimization algorithm that builds and solves surrogate\nproblems for complex MINLPs which are more tractable in practice. MiSSOC\nintegrates statistical modeling into mathematical optimization by approximating\ncomplex functions in an MINLP using smooth additive regression models with\n$B-$splines. Expert knowledge can be incorporated into the building phase of\nthe approximating functions through shape constraints related to sign (or\nbounds), monotonicity and convexity over the observed domain. Thus, MiSSOC\nfills a gap in the literature by building surrogates that are both data-driven\nand knowledge-driven. The surrogate problem is formulated by replacing the\noriginal complex functions with their approximations. The proposed MiSSOC\nalgorithm is evaluated through a set of experiments, including benchmark\ninstances and a real-world case study. MiSSOC is tested with different\nstate-of-the-art solvers and with the tailored Sequential Convex MINLP\n(SC-MINLP) algorithm. The latter exploits the separable structure of the\nsurrogate functions, which results from the approximating functions being sums\nof piecewise univariate polynomials.

To address these challenges, we introduce the\nconcept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet\nthe latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by\nusers and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive\nenvironments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource\nrequirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a\nmulti-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously\nminimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC\nresources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective\nconsistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning\nand reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights.\nLeveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates\nPareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station\ndatasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and\nsignificantly lower inference latency than baseline methods.

A major limitation of the\ntraditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order\nstructural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering\napplications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation\ntheory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only\nlower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the\nreformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor\nfunctions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point\ngroup, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the\nrepresentations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and\nsecond-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable\nto all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are\ndetermined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups.

Therefore, a novel\noptimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body\nApproach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory\nrepresentation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to\nautomate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs\nthe optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent\ngravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this\nwork is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized\nIsland Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further\nincrease the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter\ntransfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference\nproblem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s\n$\\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA\ntrajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory\noptimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is\nconsistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In\nconclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary\noptimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories."}

Firstly, an\nexplicit formula for the shrinkage vector is provided. In that expression,\nshrinkage factors are expressed a averages of a set of basic shrinkages that\ndepend only on the data matrix. On the other hand, the weights of that average\nare multilinear functions of the observed responses. That representation allows\nto characterise the set of possible shrinkages and identify extreme situations\nwhere the PLS estimator has an highly nonlinear behaviour. In these situations,\nrecently proposed measures for the degrees of freedom (DoF), that directly\ndepend on the shrinkages, fail to provide reasonable values.

As a\nresult, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned\nheuristically.

While\nthis approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an\nimportant role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems\nin an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional\napportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is\ndiscrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at\neach time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed\nnumber of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional\nshare rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to\neach party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.\n  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For\ndeterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that\nyield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the\nseats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is\nbest possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a\nmethod guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party\nup to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)\nexists if and only if $n\\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and\nshow that, for $n\\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota\nwith the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its\nproportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method\nsatisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively\nconstructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain\napproximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures."}
