ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a\ntarget of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional\nURLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the\nrate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by\nevaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of\nthe URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our\nnumerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly\noutperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular,\nit achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and\nsensing constraints."}

The main\nprinciple behind the PEGASE platform is divide-and-conquer. Indeed, rather than\ntrying to solve a problem as a monolithic entity, which can be highly complex\nfor multi-domain large-scale systems, it is often more efficient to decompose\nit into several domains or sub-problems, and to simulate them in a decoupled\nway. To provide its cosimulation capabilities, we based PEGASE on two main\ncomponents. The first one is a framework for integrating simulation models,\nwhich can be either compatible with the FMI standard or interfaced through an\nApplication Programming Interface (API). The second one is a multi-threaded\nsequencer enabling several simulation sequences with different time steps. To\nprovide advanced control capabilities, we also equipped PEGASE with a framework\nfor MPC combining a comprehensive management of predictions data and a modeler\ndedicated to the formulation of Mixed Integer Linear Programs. We implemented\nthis framework in C++ providing low formulation and resolution times for\ntypical applications. Connection to hardware is also available via standard\nindustry protocols thereby allowing PEGASE to control real energy systems.

Regarding percolation with respect to the notion\nof up-connectivity, we establish the existence of a sharp phase transition for\nthe appearance of a giant component, akin to the well-known threshold behavior\nin random graphs. This sharp phase transition is, in its generality, new even\nfor the classical RCM as a random graph. As special cases, we obtain sharp\nphase transitions for the Vietoris-Rips complex, the Cech complex, and the\nBoolean model, allowing us to identify which properties of these well-known\npercolation models are actually required."}
