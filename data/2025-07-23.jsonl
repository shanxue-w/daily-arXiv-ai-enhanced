We explain that two types (sources)\nof delay - transmission and reaction - are justifiable from the modeling point\nof view. We consider both classical and normalized communication weights.\nStudying a toy model with two agents only, we develop an intuitive insight into\nwhat type of dynamics we can expect from the systems. In particular, we stress\nthat with transmission-type delay, asymptotic consensus can be reached with any\nlength of the delay (i.e., without smallness assumptions). In contrast, the\nsystems with reaction-type delay can only reach asymptotic consensus if the\ndelay is sufficiently small.\n  We formulate four theorems that establish asymptotic consensus in the\nfollowing scenarios: (1) transmission-type delay with classical communication\nweights, (2) transmission-type delay with normalized communication weights, (3)\nreaction-type delay with symmetric communication weights, (4) reaction-type\ndelay with non-symmetric communication weights.\n  We explain how the methods of proof depend on the particular scenario: direct\nestimates for (1), convexity arguments for (2), Lyapunov functional for (3) and\ngeneralized Gronwall-Halanay inequality for (4)."}

It discusses network planning aimed\nat enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional\nfocus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network\ninfrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that\nleverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to\nlocalize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs)\nprovide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning\nrequires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution,\nLOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions.\nTo this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates\nthe need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep\nlearning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the\ntrilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes\nunreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to\nfuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving\nusers across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed\nterrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset,\nfeaturing a moving vehicle in an urban environment.

In this fully enclosed system, where no signals\nescape the hemisphere, we provide a direct empirical comparison of the\nMany-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and the Branched Hilbert Subspace\nInterpretation (BHSI). Both maintain unitarity without invoking wavefunction\ncollapse, as in the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), but differ ontologically:\nMWI proposes irreversible global branching into parallel worlds, while BHSI\ndescribes local, potentially reversible branching into decohered subspaces. In\nthis setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and\nrelocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule,\nnaturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector\nstatistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an\nenhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector.\nBecause the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average\nresponse times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of\nmeasurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted\nchoices. Our analysis challenges the notion that unitarity necessitates\nparallel worlds, instead advocating for a simpler view: local, unitary\nbranching without collapse or global splitting."}

This paper solves some open problems from the literature. We quantify\nthe effect of adding the restriction that every robot can visit every vertex\n(the so-called \\emph{completely mobile} variants), prove a bound on both mobile\nnumbers in terms of the clique number, and find the mobile mutual visibility\nnumber of line graphs of complete graphs, strong grids and Cartesian grids."}

Our approach extends previous\nstructured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified\nDeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network.\nThe architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance,\nwhile also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The\ntraining methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through\nentropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter\nregularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in\nshock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets\nsolutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial\nconditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to\ncomplex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the\nliterature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order\nfinite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy\nwhile enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed\nand reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver.\nThe proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional\nsecond-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on\ncoarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties\nessential for hyperbolic conservation laws.
