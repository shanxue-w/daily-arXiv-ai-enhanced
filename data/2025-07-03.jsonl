First, it provides a detailed\nexplanation of how to calculate the length of the repeating decimal when the\ndenominator of the fraction is a power of a prime number. Then, by factorizing\nthe denominator into its prime factors and determining the repeating decimal\nlength for each prime factor, the paper concludes that the overall repeating\ndecimal length is the least common multiple of these lengths. Furthermore, it\nexamines the conditions under which the repeating decimal length equals the\ndenominator minus 1 and discusses whether such fractions exist in infinite\nquantity. This topic is connected to an unsolved problem posed by Gauss in the\n18th century and is also closely related to the important question of whether\ncyclic numbers exist in infinite quantity."}

This methodology\nsignificantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for\nfirst-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid\nwith a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum\nbalance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP.

In the late 1990s efforts to\nindividualize dosing emerged fleetingly in the oncology trial methods\nliterature, but these have gained little traction due to a nexus of conceptual,\ntechnical, commercial, and regulatory barriers. To reduce the activation energy\nneeded for transforming current 1-size-fits-all dose-escalation trial designs\nto the dose-titration designs required for patient-centered dose\nindividualization, we demonstrate a categorical formulation of dose-escalation\nprotocols that extends readily to allow gradual introduction of dose titration.\n  Central to this formulation is a symmetric monoidal preorder on the\naccessible states of dose-escalation trials, embodying pharmacologic intuitions\nregarding dose-monotonicity of drug toxicity and ethical intuitions relating to\nthe therapeutic intent of such trials. A trial protocol that assigns doses to\nenrolling participants consistently with these intuitions is then a monotone\nmap from this preorder to the sequence of doses being trialed. We illustrate\nthis formulation by reference to the ubiquitous 3+3 dose-escalation design,\nwhich despite its many widely discussed flaws remains familiar to oncology\ntrialists and moreover has available an executable specification in Prolog.\nRemarkably, examined in light of our preorder the 3+3 protocol discloses a new\nflaw not previously described: a non-monotone dose recommendation. The right\nKan extension approximates this protocol from the side of safety, dissolving\nits triplet cohorts to allow incremental enrollment, and rectifying said\nnon-monotonicity. It also facilitates accelerated enrollment while toxicity\nassessments remain pending, as well as discretionary dose titration."}

Classical OT theory does not\ninvolve a discussion of preserving topological connections and orientations in\ntransmission results and processes. Existing numerical and geometric methods\nfor computing OT seldom pays specific attention on this aspect. Especially,\nwhen dealing with the triangular mesh data, the known semi-discrete geometric\nOT (sd-OT) method employs critical operation of Delaunay triangulation (DT) to\nadapt topology to ensure the convexity of the energy function and the existence\nof the solution. This change in topology hampers the applicability of OT in\nmodeling non-flip physical deformations in real-world tasks such as shape\nregistration and editing problems in computer vision and medical imaging\nfields. This work introduces the topology structure-preserving optimal\ntransport (QC-OT) map for the triangular mesh input. The computational strategy\nfocuses on the two components: relaxing DT and convexity check in sd-OT and\nintegrating quasiconformal (QC) correction. Here, quasiconformal mapping is\nemployed to correct the regions unexpected distortions, and guarantee the\ntopological preserving property of the transport.

This result\nprovides the first characterization of $2O$ from the spherical design\nviewpoint.\n  For $G\\in \\{2T,2O,2I\\}$, we consider the lattice $\\mathcal{O}_{G}$ generated\nby $G$ over $R_G$ on which the group $G$ acts on by multiplication, where\n$R_{2T}=\\mathbb{Z},\\ R_{2O}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}],\\\nR_{2I}=\\mathbb{Z}[(1+\\sqrt{5})/2]$ are the ring of integers. We introduce the\nspherical theta function $\\theta_{G,P}(z)$ attached to the lattice\n$\\mathcal{O}_G$ and a harmonic polynomial $P$ of degree $\\ell$ and prove that\nthey are modular forms.

To solve these problems, we\nintroduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a\nsoft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points\ninto short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context.

We give a number of both $1$-dimensional and\nhigher-dimensional examples of asymptotically disintegrable spaces with\nassociated quantitative rates, as well as a strong counterexample. Finally, we\ngive two applications of the notion of asymptotic disintegrability. First, we\nprove that asymptotically disintegrable spaces admit an easy high-probability\nquantification of the law of large numbers in Wasserstein space, which in all\ndimensions either recovers or improves upon the best known rates in some\nregimes, and is never any worse than existing rates by more than a factor of 2\nin the exponent of $n$, where $n$ is the number of sample points. Second, we\nprove that any asymptotically disintegrable space admits a high-probability\nbound on the error in approximating the expectation of any Lipschitz function\nby its empirical average over an i.i.d.\\ sample.

Namely, the limiting distribution follows a power-law distribution.\nIn this paper, we generalize our result to the bivariate setting. We do so\nusing Arnold's type definition [2] of a Lorenz curve, which offers the greatest\nparsimony among its counterparts. The situation becomes more complex in higher\ndimensions as the map affects not only the marginals but also their dependence\nstructure. Nevertheless, we prove the equally surprising result that under\nreasonable restrictions, the marginals again converge uniformly to a power-law\ndistribution, with an exponent equal to the golden section. Furthermore, they\nbecome independent in the limit. To emphasize the multifaceted nature of the\nproblem and broaden the scope of potential applications, our approach utilizes\na variety of mathematical tools, extending beyond very specialized methods."}

Entropic penalties steer the\ninduced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For\ninstance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures\nare the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this\nwork, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed\nto be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and\nprovide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a\nmatrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete\ndescription of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual\nvariables.

The multipacking\nnumber of $G$, denoted $\\operatorname{mp}(G)$, is the maximum cardinality of a\nmultipacking in $G$. These two optimisation problems are duals of each other,\nand it easily follows that $\\operatorname{mp}(G) \\leqslant \\gamma_b(G)$. It is\nknown that $\\gamma_b(G) \\leqslant 2\\operatorname{mp}(G)+3$ and conjectured that\n$\\gamma_b(G) \\leqslant 2\\operatorname{mp}(G)$.\n  In this paper, we show that for the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ $$\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n  \\leqslant \\operatorname{mp}(Q_n)\n  \\leqslant \\frac{n}{2} + 6\\sqrt{2n}. $$\n  Since $\\gamma_b(Q_n) = n-1$ for all $n \\geqslant 3$, this verifies the above\nconjecture on hypercubes and, more interestingly, gives a sequence of connected\ngraphs for which the ratio $\\frac{\\gamma_b(G)}{\\operatorname{mp}(G)}$\napproaches $2$, a search for which was initiated by Beaudou, Brewster and\nFoucaud in 2018. It follows that, for connected graphs $G$ $$\n  \\limsup_{\\operatorname{mp}(G) \\rightarrow \\infty}\n\\left\\{\\frac{\\gamma_b(G)}{\\operatorname{mp}(G)}\\right\\} = 2.$$\n  The lower bound on $\\operatorname{mp}(Q_n)$ is established by a recursive\nconstruction, and the upper bound is established using a classic result from\ndiscrepancy theory."}

While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric\ncomplex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may\nnot be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not\nsupported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by\ninvestigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary\namplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's\nsignals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the\nachievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK\nmodulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first\nderive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results\nreveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase\nof MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We\nthen formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting\nthe phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive\nthe optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an\nimprovement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is\nbetter than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate,\nespecially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the\nbackscatter link in SBC."}

A type of finite-time\ncollapse/blowup of the solution of the associated dispersionless limit was\ninvestigated by Talanov in the 1960s, and recently Suleimanov identified a\nspecial solution of the dispersive problem that formally regularizes the blowup\nand is related to the hierarchy of the Painlev\\'e-III equation. In this paper\nwe approximate the Talanov solutions in the full dispersive equation using a\nsemiclassical soliton ensemble, a sequence of exact reflectionless solutions\nfor a corresponding sequence of values of the semiclassical parameter epsilon\ntending to zero, approximating the Talanov initial data more and more\naccurately in the limit as epsilon tends to zero. In this setting, we\nrigorously establish the validity of the dispersive saturation of the Talanov\nblowup obtained by Suleimanov. We extend the result to the full hierarchy of\nhigher focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, exhibiting new\ngeneralizations of the Talanov initial data that produce such dispersively\nregularized extreme focusing in both mixed and pure flows. We also argue that\ngeneric perturbations of the Talanov initial data lead to a different\nsingularity of the dispersionless limit, namely a gradient catastrophe for\nwhich the dispersive regularization is instead based on the tritronqu\\'ee\nsolution of the Painlev\\'e-I equation and the Peregrine breather solution which\nappears near points in space time corresponding to the poles of the former\ntranscendental function as shown by Bertola and Tovbis."}

According to\nthe nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and\nhinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming\nat extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed\nover the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for\nsmall signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper\ndevelops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing\nthe properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of\nmaximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix\ndistributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and\nnon-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions\ndepending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of\nthe empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose\ncharacteristics change when the collective behaviour of \"informational\" modes\nbecome significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise.\nThis paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the\nreal effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called \"signal\", while\nimproving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second,\nwe show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a\ncounterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors.

A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array."}

We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees.
