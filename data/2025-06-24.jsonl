However, in high-mobility scenarios, OFDM\nsuffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI), and its reliance on dense pilot\npatterns and cyclic prefixes significantly reduces spectral efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose Deep-OFDM: a learnable modulation framework that augments\ntraditional OFDM by incorporating neural parameterization. Instead of mapping\neach symbol to a fixed resource element, Deep-OFDM spreads information across\nthe OFDM grid using a convolutional neural network modulator. This modulator is\njointly optimized with a neural receiver through end-to-end training, enabling\nthe system to adapt to time-varying channels without relying on explicit\nchannel estimation. Deep-OFDM outperforms conventional OFDM when paired with\nneural receiver baselines, particularly in pilot-sparse and pilotless regimes,\nachieving substantial gains in BLER and goodput, especially at high Doppler\nfrequencies. In the pilotless setting, the neural modulator learns a low-rank\nstructure that resembles a superimposed pilot, effectively enabling reliable\ncommunication without explicit overhead. Deep-OFDM demonstrates significant\nimprovements in BLER and goodput at high Doppler frequencies across various\nscenarios, including MIMO systems. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the\nrole of nonlinear activations and characterize performance-complexity\ntrade-offs. These results highlight the potential of transmitter-receiver\nco-design for robust, resource-efficient communication, paving the way for\nAI-native physical layer designs in next-generation wireless systems."}

In this context, the correct estimation of physically\ncorrect hydraulic states, i.e., pressure heads, water demands and water flows,\nis of high interest. Hydraulic emulators such as EPANET or more recently,\nphysic-informed surrogate models are used to solve this task. They require a\nsubset of observed states, such as heads at reservoirs and water demands, as\ninputs to estimate the whole hydraulic state. In order to obtain reliable\nresults of such emulators, but also to be able to give theoretical guarantees\nof their estimations, an important question is whether theoretically, the\nsubset of observed states that the emulator requires as an input suffices to\nderive the whole state, purely based on the physical properties, also called\nhydraulic principles, it obeys. This questions translates to solving linear and\nnon-linear systems of equations. Previous articles investigate on the existence\nquestion under the term observability analysis, however, they rely on the\napproximation of the non-linear principles using Taylor approximation and on\nnetwork-dependent numerical or algebraic algorithms. In this work, we provide\npurely theoretical guarantees on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to\nthe non-linear hydraulic principles, and by this, the existence and uniqueness\nof physically correct states, given common subsets of them -- a result that\nseems to be common-sense in the water community but has never been rigorously\nproven.

In this stage, covariance-driven\nregularization is employed to optimize the orthogonality of the basis functions\ngenerated by the last hidden layer. The key innovation lies in minimizing the\noff-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix derived from the hidden-layer\noutput. By doing so, pairwise orthogonality constraints across collocation\npoints are enforced which effectively enhances both the numerical stability and\nthe approximation ability of the optimized function space.The RINN algorithm\nunfolds in two sequential stages. First, it conducts a non-linear optimization\nprocess to orthogonalize the basis functions. Subsequently, it solves the PDE\nconstraints using linear least-squares method.

Using a\nvalidated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, we show\nthat filament geometry, thermal gradients, and flow-induced buoyancy do not\nmerely affect uniformity -- they define the very regimes (reaction-limited,\ntransition, diffusion-limited) in which deposition occurs.

Similarly, multi-filament setups do not simply scale\ndeposition, they reshape flow fields and compound thermal asymmetries,\nsometimes improving uniformity, other times worsening it.

The only requirements\non functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time\nt=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic\neverywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and\npossibly others with Im (p) < 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at\ninfinity in the lower complex semiplane.

In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation\napproaches the case of a sudden quench.

The main result states that for mass\nratios sufficiently close to $\\frac{1}{2}$ and energies slightly above the\nfirst Lagrange value, the flow on the regularized component $\\mathbb R P^3 \\#\n\\mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface admits a finite energy foliation with\nthree binding orbits, namely two retrograde orbits around the primaries and the\nLyapunov orbit in the neck region about the first Lagrange point. This\nfoliation explains the numerically observed homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov\norbits. The critical energy surface is proved to satisfy the strict convexity\ncondition in regularizing elliptic coordinates. This allows for the application\nof a general abstract result for Reeb vector fields on holed lens spaces,\nconcerning the existence of finite energy foliations with prescribed binding\norbits. As a by-product of the convex analysis, Birkhoff's retrograde orbit\nconjecture is proved for mass ratios sufficiently close to $\\frac{1}{2}$ and\nall energies below the first Lagrange value. This conjecture states that the\nretrograde orbit bounds a disk-like global surface of section on each\nregularized component $\\mathbb R P^3$ of the energy surface."}

Further developments include Random Fourier Signature\nFeatures, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and\nRecurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian\nprocesses, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting\nmechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context\nlength.\n  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual\nbridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in\nscalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data."}

The\nchallenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling\nof the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered\ncondensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully\nreconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi\ncells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the\ncrystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the\nexistence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with\nprobability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These\nfour largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be\nused to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection\nsupplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We\nconjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large\nthermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting\ntemperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and\ntherefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase."}

These\nadvances enable us to derive a compactly-encoded replenishment policy whose\nlong-run average cost is within factor $1 + \\epsilon$ of the dynamic optimum,\narriving at an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS).\nTechnically speaking, our approach hinges on affirmative resolutions to two\nfundamental open questions:\n  -- We devise the first efficient discretization-based framework for\napproximating the joint replenishment problem. Specifically, we prove that\nevery continuous-time infinite-horizon instance can be reduced to a\ncorresponding discrete-time $O( \\frac{ n^3 }{ \\epsilon^6 } )$-period instance,\nwhile incurring a multiplicative optimality loss of at most $1 + \\epsilon$.\n  -- Motivated by this relation, we substantially improve on the $O(\n2^{2^{O(1/\\epsilon)}} \\cdot (nT)^{ O(1) } )$-time approximation scheme of\nNonner and Sviridenko (2013) for the discrete-time joint replenishment problem.\nBeyond an exponential improvement in running time, we demonstrate that\nrandomization and hierarchical decompositions can be entirely avoided, while\nconcurrently offering a relatively simple analysis."}

At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step\nsize from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified\nthreshold. Like NUTS, WALNUTS employs biased progressive state selection to\nfavor states with positions that are further from the initial point along the\norbit. Empirical evaluations on multiscale target distributions, including\nNeal's funnel and the Stock-Watson stochastic volatility time-series model,\ndemonstrate that WALNUTS achieves substantial improvements in sampling\nefficiency and robustness compared to standard NUTS."}

This paper introduces classical optimization algorithms for\nHamiltonian diagonalization by formulating a cost function that penalizes\noff-diagonal terms and enforces unitarity via an orthogonality constraint, both\nexpressed in the Pauli operator basis. We pinpoint a class of Hamiltonians that\nhighlights severe drawbacks of existing methods, including exponential\nper-iteration cost, exponential circuit depth, or convergence to spurious\noptima. Our approach overcomes these shortcomings, achieving polynomial-time\nefficiency while provably avoiding suboptimal points. As a result, we broaden\nthe known realm of fast-forwardable systems, showing that\nquantum-diagonalizable Hamiltonians extend to cases generated by exponentially\nlarge Lie algebras.

The standard approach to diffusion problems\nrequires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the\nconservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is\ntraditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material\nmodels. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material\nmodel, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and\nboundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the\nexperimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the\nneed of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation\nlaw a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element\nformulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces\nwhile enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner\nboundaries. This weaker mixed formulation provides a posteriori error\nindicators tailored for this data-driven approach, enabling adaptive\nhp-refinement. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it\neasier to observe how the variation in the datasets results in the\nnon-uniqueness of the solution, which can be quantified to predict the\nuncertainty of the results.
