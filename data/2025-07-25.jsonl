We\ndevelop a framework that integrates thresholding operators--including hard\nthresholding, springback, and Newton thresholding--directly into the\nhyperinterpolation structure to maintain sparsity during signal recovery. Our\napproach leverages Newton's method to minimize one-dimensional nonconvex\nfunctions, which we then extend to solve multivariable nonconvex regularization\nproblems. The proposed methods demonstrate robust performance in reconstructing\nsignals corrupted by both Gaussian and impulse noise. Through numerical\nexperiments, we validate the effectiveness of these recovery thresholding\nhyperinterpolations for signal reconstruction and function denoising\napplications, showing their advantages over traditional approaches in\npreserving signal sparsity while achieving accurate recovery."}

The algorithm, based on the\nrecently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave\nequation as part of an iteration. At each iteration, the solution to the wave\nequation is filtered in time. As the iteration progresses, the filtered\nsolution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of\neigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target\neigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the\ncomputation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert\nan indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches. Furthermore, the\niteration can be embedded within a matrix-free Arnoldi algorithm, which enables\nthe efficient computation of multiple eigenpairs near the target frequency. For\nefficiency, the time-dependent wave equation can be solved with implicit\ntime-stepping and only about $10$ time-steps per-period are needed, independent\nof the mesh spacing. When the (definite) implicit time-stepping equations are\nsolved with a multigrid algorithm, the cost of the resulting EigenWave scheme\nscales linearly with the number of grid points $N$ as the mesh is refined,\ngiving an optimal $O(N)$ algorithm. The approach is demonstrated by finding\neigenpairs of the Laplacian in complex geometry using overset grids. Results in\ntwo and three space dimensions are presented using second-order and\nfourth-order accurate approximations."}

In standard dynamic pricing systems, an increasing price is used to\nbalance supply and demand for a resource in a constrained environment. A major\ndrawback of dynamic pricing is that it is socially regressive as such systems\nfavour price-insensitive traffic (inelastic) and control the demand at the\nexpense of price-sensitive traffic (elastic). We tackle this challenge by\ndescribing a new form of pricing that strikes a balance between using price to\nmanage demand for a resource and ensuring fair access to the resource for both\nelastic and inelastic traffic. Our system gives rise to a switched non-linear\nODE model, the stability of which is equivalent to ensuring the fairness\nproperties of the pricing system.

The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training.

To check the latent-subgraph criterion, we provide a sound and complete\nalgorithm that operates by solving an integer linear program. While it targets\neffects involving observed variables, our new criterion is also useful for\nidentifying effects between latent variables, as it allows one to transform the\ngiven model into a simpler measurement model for which other existing tools\nbecome applicable."}

Our results\nshow that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\\theta$\nbecomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$),\nwhile still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$).\nThe QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$,\nsuggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI\nwith respect to $\\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially\ndue to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is\nunaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels,\nwhere $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence.\nOverall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental\nnoise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime."}

In this\nwork, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\\epsilon$\nand disc mass fraction, $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars\nin isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle\nresolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on\n$m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ as $\\propto m_{\\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in\nbar formation.

This suggests that $\\epsilon$\ninteract to either enhance or weaken the bar.

Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method.

We call this approach the moment martingale posterior, as\nthe core of our proposed methodology is to utilize the method of moments as the\nvehicle for tying the nonparametric and parametric components together. In\nparticular, the predictives are constructed so that the moments are\nmartingales, which allows us to verify convergence under predictive resampling.\nA key contribution of this work is a novel procedure based on the energy score\nto optimally weigh between the parametric and nonparametric components, which\nhas desirable asymptotic properties. The effectiveness of the proposed approach\nis demonstrated through simulations and a real world example."}
