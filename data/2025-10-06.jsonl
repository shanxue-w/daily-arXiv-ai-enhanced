The\nefficiency of the proposed method is built upon four essential components: (i)\na martingale formulation of the forward backward stochastic differential\nequation (FBSDE); (ii) a small scale stochastic particle method for local\nlinear regression (LLR); (iii) a decoupling strategy with a matrix-free solver\nfor the weighted least-squares system used to compute $\\nabla u$; (iv) a Newton\niteration for solving the univariate nonlinear system in $u$. Unlike\ntraditional deterministic methods that rely on global information, this\nlocalized computational scheme not only provides explicit pointwise evaluations\nof $u$ and $\\nabla u$ but, more importantly, is naturally suited for\nparallelization across particles. In addition, the algorithm avoids the need\nfor spatial meshes and global basis functions required by classical\ndeterministic approaches, as well as the derivative-dependent and lengthy\ntraining procedures often encountered in machine learning. More importantly, we\nrigorously analyze the error bound of the proposed scheme, which is fully\nexplicit in both the particle number $M$ and the time step size $\\Delta t$.\nNumerical results conducted for problem dimensions ranging from $d=100$ to\n$d=10000$ consistently verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed\nmethod. Remarkably, all computations are carried out efficiently on a standard\npersonal computer, without requiring any specialized hardware. These results\nconfirm that the proposed method is built upon a principled design that not\nonly extends the practical solvability frontier of ultra-high-dimensional PDEs\nbut also maintains rigorous error control and ease of implementation."}

In special\ncases, it also provides a formula for the $\\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex\nfunctions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over\nreverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture,\nsuch expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma\nmodules on the 3d mirror dual side.\n  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what\ncan be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums\nof Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional\nframing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking\nproducts."}

How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue\nthat it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the\nsystem's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the\nlevel of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many\nsystems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small\nsubset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the\ntheory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions\nacross the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single\npath that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be\nclassified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent\nhierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific\nnotion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the\nscales of a system) than the standard network science terminology.

The complexity of all\ncurrent bootstrapping methods is fundamentally tied to the multiplicative depth\nof the decryption circuit, denoted $L_{dec}$, making it the primary performance\nbottleneck. This paper introduces a new approach to bootstrapping that\ncompletely bypasses the traditional circuit evaluation model. We apply the\ntools of modern arithmetic geometry to reframe the bootstrapping operation as a\ndirect geometric projection. Our framework models the space of ciphertexts as\nan affine scheme and rigorously defines the loci of decryptable and fresh\nciphertexts as distinct closed subschemes. The bootstrapping transformation is\nthen realized as a morphism between these two spaces. Computationally, this\nprojection is equivalent to solving a specific Closest Vector Problem (CVP)\ninstance on a highly structured ideal lattice, which we show can be done\nefficiently using a technique we call algebraic folding.

We establish existence of solutions to the\ncorresponding ODEs and regularity of the induced flows on measures, even when\ncontrol laws are nonsmooth.\n  Finally, we illustrate the framework on linear and nonlinear systems,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness for both measure transport and stabilization\nproblems."}

Moreover, by classifying cases according to the\nstate dimension $n_1$, the nature of the delay, and the assumptions of the\ncoefficients, we provide several subcases where faster convergence rates can be\nobtained; for instance the\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-\\frac{2}{3n_1}}\\right)$-convergence when the diffusion\ncoefficients are independent of control variable. Our result extends the\nstandard $o(1)$-convergence result for the mean field Stackelberg games in the\nliterature, together with the $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-\\frac{1}{n_1+4}})$-convergence\nfor the mean field games with major and minor players. We also discuss the\nspecial case where our coefficients are linear in distribution argument while\nnonlinear in state and control arguments, and we establish an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{N})$ convergence rate, which extends the linear quadratic\ncases in the literature."}

It follows from recent\njoint work with Mesquita-Piccione [MW25], but is here given a more direct\nproof. The second result is a Calabi-Yau theorem for a wider class of\ndegenerations, formulated in the language of non-Archimedean K\\\"ahler geometry.\nIt was first proved in the algebraic setting by Boucksom-Jonsson [BJ22],\nbuilding on earlier work of Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson [BFJ15], while the general\nK\\\"ahler case was established in [MW25]. Our main focus here is on the\nconnection between these results and the theory of big cohomology classes and\ntheir volumes."}

It reformulates the crystal\ndetermination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common\nintersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds\nof isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized\nratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods\nin PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The\nelegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates,\nenabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by\ncombining multiple projections.

We do not assume that the Hamiltonian is\nconvex in the momentum variable, which means that we cannot rely on\nrepresentation formulas coming from mean field control. In this setting,\nGangbo, Mayorga, and \\'Swi\\k{e}ch showed via viscosity solutions methods that\nthe HJB equation on $\\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ can be approximated by a\nsequence of finite-dimensional HJB equations. Our main contribution is to\nquantify this convergence result. The proof involves a doubling of variables\nargument, which leverages the Hilbertian approach of P.L.

This method involves analysing the coupled\nvehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to\nassess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical\nand dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting\nthe effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for\noptimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An\nunsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used\nto reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.\nThe mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are\noptimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index\ndistributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is\nemployed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify\noptimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional\nparameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3\nand 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,\nwhile those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower\nnatural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to\nrigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a\npurpose-built inspection vehicle."}

One of them remains the\nunderfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the\nidentification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this,\nwe introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from\nwhich we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for\ngeometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for\nidentification is axially ``sliced\" into multiple low-dimensional submappings\n(``slices\"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed\ninto a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks\nand adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online\nvia Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation\n(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we\nprove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to\nexponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and\nmodel uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential\nconvergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and\nspecific knowledge of the model."}

In this work, we provide a\nprincipled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a\ngeneralization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local\ncurvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits\ndesirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically\nthat this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with\nmean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove\nthat Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than\nwith a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.\nFinally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language\nand vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules."}
