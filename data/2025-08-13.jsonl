Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and\nmore recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a\nnew framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based\nESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies\nin the use of discontinuous \"relay-type\" control components, replacing\ntraditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic\nnonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the\nfirst attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes\nwithin the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach,\nthe convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective\nfunction. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by\nemploying a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a\nRiccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the\nclosed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging\nLyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with\ndiscontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed\nmethod, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness\ncompared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only\nexponential stability.

Despite their strong\nperformance guarantees, most existing work has focused primarily on improving\nthe operational accuracy of learned control policies and the convergence rates\nof learning algorithms, with comparatively little attention to uncertainty\nquantification and statistical inference. Yet, these aspects are essential for\nassessing the reliability and variability of control policies, especially in\nhigh-stakes applications. In this paper, we study statistical inference for the\npolicy gradient (PG) method for noisy Linear Quadratic Reinforcement learning\n(LQ RL) over a finite time horizon, where linear dynamics with both known and\nunknown drift parameters are controlled subject to a quadratic cost. We\nestablish the theoretical foundations for statistical inference in LQ RL,\nderiving exact asymptotics for both the PG estimators and the corresponding\nobjective loss. Furthermore, we introduce a principled inference framework that\nleverages online bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals for both the\nlearned optimal policy and the corresponding objective losses. The method\nupdates the PG estimates along with a set of randomly perturbed PG estimates as\nnew observations arrive. We prove that the proposed bootstrapping procedure is\ndistributionally consistent and that the resulting confidence intervals achieve\nboth asymptotic and non-asymptotic validity.

Extensions to POD have been proposed to address this, but these\neither require large amounts of solution data, lack online adaptivity, or have\nlimited approximation accuracy. We circumvent these limitations by instead\nassigning weights to the snapshot matrix columns, and updating these whenever\nthe model is evaluated at a new point in the parameter space. We derive an a\nposteriori error bound that depends on these snapshot weights, show how these\nweights can be chosen to tighten the error bound, and present an algorithm to\ncompute the corresponding reduced basis efficiently. We show how this weighted\nPOD approach can be used to naturally generalize the calculation of reduced\nbasis derivatives to situations with multidimensional parameter spaces and\nsnapshots at multiple locations in the parameter space. Lastly, we cover how\nthese approaches can be implemented within an optimization algorithm, without\nthe need for an offline training phase. The proposed weighted POD methods with\nand without reduced basis derivatives are applied to a gradient-based shell\nthickness optimization problem with 105 design parameters and a time-dependent\npartial differential equation. The numerical solutions obtained for this\nproblem attain errors that are several orders of magnitude smaller when using\nweighted POD than those computed with regular POD and Grassmann manifold\ninterpolation, while having comparable wall times per query and requiring fewer\nhigh-dimensional model snapshots to reach an optimal solution."}

We develop a bottleneck model where\ncommuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs,\nand analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing,\naverage-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing\nreduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service\nprovider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has\ncontrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the\nexistence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages\nadoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV\nadoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and\nachieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that\nexpanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost\npricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems\nwith SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost,\nincluding the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines\nmarginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that\nrelies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can\nlimit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that\npromoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost."}

The basic\nidea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts,\nthen use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact\nderivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)\nwhich generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two\nadvantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,\nallowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final\nderivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative\nestimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the\nPSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate\n$U(x) = \\exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs\nare valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.\nAdditionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by\nWierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it\nyields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the\nweighted-shot scheme.

We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that\nis, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without\nsequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r\nand m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance.
