In this work, we illustrate this relation\nusing the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and\nquantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the\ngeneralized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in\nstochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the\nnoise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic\nperturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and\nstochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase\ndefinitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift\nterm analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory,\nstochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how\nnoise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications\nof geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural\nmodels."}

The\nsystem serves as both a practical solution for reducing electricity costs and a\npedagogical tool for teaching real-time energy control concepts in power and\nembedded systems courses. Unlike conventional EMS/DCM solutions that rely on\nhigh-cost commercial hardware or purely theoretical models, the proposed system\nintegrates grid power, lithium-iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery storage, and\nreal-time control into a unified, scalable platform constructed at a fraction\nof the cost, approximately $1,800 compared to over $16,000 for leading\ncommercial options. The controller dynamically optimizes energy usage by\nswitching between grid and battery sources based on real-time measurements of\nelectricity prices, load power, and battery state of charge (SoC). This enables\npeak shaving, energy arbitrage, and backup power functionality, thereby\nenhancing cost efficiency and grid resilience for both residential and small\ncommercial users. The architecture features a modular three-layer design\ncomprising a sensing layer for electrical data acquisition, a control layer\nexecuting Python-based logic on a Raspberry Pi, and an actuator layer for\nseamless energy switching. Data is communicated via MQTT and visualized through\nthe Blynk IoT platform, providing an intuitive and remotely accessible user\ninterface.

In\ncontrast, the popular Cauchy combination test is shown to be universally honest\nbut often conservative; the Tippet combination test, while being honest, is\ncalibrated if and only if the underlying $p$-values are tail-independent.\n  One of our major findings is that the Pareto-type linear combination tests\nare the only universally calibrated ones among the large family of possibly\nnon-linear homogeneous heavy-tailed combination tests."}

Neural networks can provide an efficient tool to\nsolve these problems. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems, Uncertainty\nQuantification Variational AutoEncoders (UQ-VAE), a class of neural networks,\napproximate the posterior distribution mean and covariance of model parameters.\nThis allows for both the estimation of the parameters and their uncertainty in\nrelation to the observational data. In this work, we propose a novel loss\nfunction for training UQ-VAEs, which includes, among other modifications, the\nremoval of a sample mean term from an already existing one. This modification\nimproves the accuracy of UQ-VAEs, as the original theoretical result relies on\nthe convergence of the sample mean to the expected value (a condition that, in\nhigh dimensional parameter spaces, requires a prohibitively large number of\nsamples due to the curse of dimensionality). Avoiding the computation of the\nsample mean significantly reduces the training time in high dimensional\nparameter spaces compared to previous literature results. Under this new\nformulation, we establish a new theoretical result for the approximation of the\nposterior mean and covariance for general mathematical problems. We validate\nthe effectiveness of UQ-VAEs through three benchmark numerical tests: a Poisson\ninverse problem, a non affine inverse problem and a 0D cardiocirculatory model,\nunder the two clinical scenarios of systemic hypertension and ventricular\nseptal defect.

This broad setting induces\nexpressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that\ngeneralize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural\nmodeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees.

In this regime, we show that for each\niteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic\nvector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can\nbe tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two\nscalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of\ndesign matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic\nconvergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient\ndescent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and\nstrongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as\nthe `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models\nunder Gaussian data.\n  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two\napplications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we\nprove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent\ninitialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish\nuniversality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for\nlarge aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm\nfor estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent\ntrajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for\npractical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.\n  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio\nregime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line\nof dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time\nhorizon."}

In the offline stage, the DiGCA phase classifier innovatively\nincorporates both solutions and their derivatives for training a graph\nconvolutional autoencoder which effectively captures intricate spatial\ndependencies while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the solution\nspace. In the online phase, the framework employs a neural network classifier\nto efficiently categorize encoded solutions into distinct phase diagrams. The\nnumerical results demonstrate that the DiGCA phase classifier accurately solves\nthe LP model, classifies its solutions, and rapidly generates detailed phase\ndiagrams in a robust manner, offering significant improvements in both\nefficiency and accuracy over traditional methods."}

We explore when and where\nto apply Ising solvers in the search tree and introduce a custom branching rule\noptimized QUBO embedding. Our method is evaluated on hundreds of QUBO instances\nfrom QUBOLib.jl using Gurobi and the D-Wave quantum annealer. Our results show\nup to 11% less solution time and 17% fewer nodes compared to default Gurobi, an\noff-the-shelf commercial optimization solver. These findings demonstrate the\nvalue of hybrid quantum-classical strategies for enhancing exact optimization."}

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the\nproposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and\nhardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios."}

A well-known conjecture of Stanley posits that the h-vector\nof a matroid is a pure O-sequence, meaning that it can be obtained by counting\nfaces of a pure multicomplex. Merino has established Stanley's conjecture for\nthe case of cographic matroids via chip-firing on graphs and the concept of a\nG-parking function. Inspired by these constructions, we introduce the notion of\na cycle system for a matroid M -- a family of cycles (unions of circuits) of M\nwith overlap properties that mimic cut-sets in a graph. A choice of cycle\nsystem on M defines a collection of integer sequences that we call coparking\nfunctions. We show that for any cycle system on M, the set of coparking\nfunctions is in bijection with the set of bases of M. We show that maximal\ncoparking functions all have the same degree, and that cycle systems behave\nwell under deletion and contraction. This leads to a proof of Stanley's\nconjecture for the case of matroids that admit cycle systems, which include,\nfor instance, graphic matroids of cones as well as K33-free graphs."}

This paper presents a novel\ntwo-phase algorithmic framework for designing optimal micro-transit service\nzones based on the objective of maximizing served demand. A key innovation is\nour adaptation of the shareability graph concept from its traditional use in\ndynamic trip assignment to the distinct challenge of static spatial zoning. We\nredefine shareability by considering geographical proximity within a specified\ndiameter constraint, rather than trip characteristics. In Phase 1, the\nframework employs a highly scalable algorithm to generate a comprehensive set\nof candidate zones. In Phase 2, it formulates the selection of a specified\nnumber of zones as a Weighted Maximum Coverage Problem, which can be\nefficiently solved by an integer programming solver. Evaluations on real-world\ndata from Chattanooga, TN, and synthetic datasets show that our framework\noutperforms a baseline algorithm, serving 27.03% more demand in practice and up\nto 49.5% more demand in synthetic settings."}

In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the\nfluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the\nfluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes. Moreover, KDMC with\nthe fluid estimation outperforms the kinetic MC method with a clear speed-up.\nOverall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm."}

Testing for compliance is\nperformed first by computer simulation using what is called a discipline model.\nSuch a model can be implemented by a finite element analysis, multibody systems\napproach, etc. Designs passing this simulation are then considered for physical\nprototyping. The overall process may take months, and is a significant cost in\npractice. We have developed a Bayesian optimization system for partially\nautomating this process by directly optimizing compliance with the target\nspecification with respect to the design parameters. The proposed method is a\ngeneral framework for computing a generalized inverse of a high-dimensional\nnon-linear function that does not require e.g. gradient information, which is\noften unavailable from discipline models. We furthermore develop a two-tier\nconvergence criterion based on (i) convergence to a solution optimally\nsatisfying all specified design criteria, or (ii) convergence to a minimum-norm\nsolution. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a vehicle chassis design\nproblem motivated by an industry setting using a state-of-the-art commercial\ndiscipline model. We show that the proposed approach is general, scalable, and\nefficient, and that the novel convergence criteria can be implemented\nstraightforwardly based on existing concepts and subroutines in popular\nBayesian optimization software packages."}

Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks\nthat can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.\nAmong these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated\nexploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and\nmanipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only\nexisting intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the\nchallenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks\nin robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,\nViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a\nvision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's\nauthority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes\nSAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate\nmaps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models\nnominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A\nframe-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an\nonline detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a\nreal-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data,\ncollecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios\nwith graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the\nproposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity\nattacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These\nimprovements are most evident in the most subtle attacks.
