These models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory\nto generate edges through a notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend\nis my friend'' and anticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend.''\n  Zero forcing, introduced independently by Burgarth and Giovanetti and a\nspecial working group at AIM in 2007 and 2008, begins with some set of forced\nvertices, the remaining are unforced. If a forced vertex has a single unforced\nneighbor, that neighbor becomes forced. The minimum number of vertices in a\nstarting set required to guarantee all vertices eventually become forced is the\nzero forcing number of the graph. The maximum number of vertices in a starting\nset such that the graph cannot become fully forced is the failed zero forcing\nnumber of a graph. In this paper we provide bounds for both the zero forcing\nand failed zero forcing number of graphs created using both the ILT and ILAT\nmodels. In particular, we show that in the case of ILAT graphs the failed zero\nforcing number can only take on one of four values, dependent on the number of\nvertices of the graph.

Most existing works in this area adopt sophisticated optimization\nand learning tools to identify the optimal antenna locations in a numerical\nmanner, where insightful understandings of the pinching antenna placement are\nstill missing. Motivated by this research gap, this paper aims to carry out\nanalytical optimization for pinching antenna placement, where closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal antenna locations are obtained to reveal the impact\nof antenna placement on the system performance. In particular, for the\nuser-fairness-oriented orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based transmission,\nanalytical results are obtained to reveal that the pinching antenna needs to be\nactivated at the place that would be beneficial to all served users; however,\nthe users' distances to the waveguide have no impact on the location selection.\nFor the greedy-allocation-based OMA transmission, an asymptotic study based on\na high signal-to-noise ratio approximation is carried out to show that the\noptimal antenna location is in close proximity to the user who is nearest to\nthe waveguide. For non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission,\neven with a user-fairness-oriented objective, the obtained analytical results\nshow that the optimal antenna location is not the position that can benefit all\nusers, but rather is near the user positioned closest to the waveguide."}

It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between\nfeatures, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and\nPeyr\\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices\nbetween samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding\npositive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices\nto OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the\nalgorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we\nexamine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose\nto use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it\nconverges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not\nparacontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the\nnatural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show\nhow Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine\nan approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have\njust to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple\nalgorithms from linear algebra can be applied."}

The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$.

However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete.

This eliminates\nthe need for synthesizing a single complex CBF that matches the entire free\nspace. It also enables easier adaptation to diverse environments. By assigning\na differentiable dynamics on the parameter space, we derive a lightweight\nfeedback controller based on quadratic programming (QP), namely PCBF-QP. We\nalso discuss on how to build a valid PCBF for a class of systems and how to\nconstrain the parameter so that the invariant set does not exceed the safety\nbound. The concept is also extended to cover continuously parametrized\nhigh-order CBFs, which is called high-order PCBF. Finally, simulation\nexperiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach."}

Accepted to ESA 2025", "summary": "A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by\ntaking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from\n(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\\tilde O(n^2k^2)$\ntime.\n  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from\nan optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to\nevaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous\nanalysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved\napproximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method\nnaturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework."}

To address this,\nwe first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding\npolicy ($\\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the\ntraining of the target policy ($\\pion$). This approach improves training\nstability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.\nSecondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are\noften discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these\nsamples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance\nsample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,\ndemonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution\nwithin the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The\nproposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and\nexploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization."}
