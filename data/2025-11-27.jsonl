Rossmanith"], "title": "A Modified BGK Collision Operator for Exact Conservation in Numerical Solutions of Boltzmann-BGK", "categories": ["math.NA"], "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines."}

However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering."}

For that purpose we construct two categories named respectively Political Configuration and Political Foundation. Our construction depends on a couple of variables called the foundational pair. One variable, called the Base, consists of a finite number of members (agents), while the other, called the Ground, consists of a set of states that reflect all relevant interests/values/aspirations of the base members. An object of the Configuration, called p-formation, extends the notion of simplicial complex, and a morphism, which expresses the recomposition of the base, extends the notion of simplicial map. An object of the Foundation, called p-site, describes the profile of the polity, that is, how the states of the ground are intertwined between the agents. A morphism between political sites consists of a pair of maps, namely a Base map and a Ground map, satisfying appropriate conditions. Two functors relate the Foundation and the Configuration: the Knit which attributes to each p-site a p-formation and the Nerve which attributes to each p-site a simplicial complex. In the opposite direction a functor, called Canon, which attributes to any p-formation its canonical p-site, turns out to be in an appropriate sense the inverse of the Knit and the Nerve."}

Specifically, we prove that convergence to the appropriate central limit distribution is mediated entirely by the behavior of the first four (mixed) moments of the two stochastic integrals, which in turn controls the $L^2$ norms of partial integral contractions of those kernels. The key step in both the free and $q$-Gaussian settings is a polarization identity for fourth cumulants of sums which holds only when the two terms have differing parities. These results are analogous to the recent preprint Fourth-Moment Theorems for Sums of Multiple Integrals by Basse-O'Connor, Kramer-Bang, and Svedsen in the classical Wiener-Itô chaos setting."}

Unlike adversarial distribution shift frameworks that yield conservative worst-case guarantees, RUPs induce dataset-level variance inflation rather than systematic bias. We provide examples of RUPs and show that this distributional uncertainty reduces the effective sample size to $n_{\\mathrm{eff}} = n/(1 + n τ)$, where $τ\\in [0,1]$ quantifies the perturbation strength. For local polynomial estimators, we derive an extended bias-variance decomposition that includes a distributional variance term with the same bandwidth scaling as classical sampling variance.

The invariants are defined either when the Lagrangian is a rational cohomology sphere or when the Lagrangian is fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, has dimension $2$ modulo $4$, and its cohomology is that of a sphere aside from degree $1$ modulo $4$. In dimension $2$, these invariants recover Welschinger's invariants.\n  We develop an obstruction theory for the existence and uniqueness of bounding cochains in a Fukaya $A_\\infty$ algebra with non-commutative coefficients.

Yet, they are remarkably dissimilar from 2 in many respects. In this paper, we will examine these five algebras both algebraically and logically. We define, and initiate an investigation into, a subvariety, called RUNO1, of the variety of De Morgan semi-Heyting algebras and show that RUNO1 is, in fact, the variety generated by the five algebras. Then several applications of this theorem are given. It is shown that RUNO1 is a discriminator variety and that all five algebras are primal. It is also shown that every subvariety of RUNO1 satisfies the Strong Amalgamation Property and the property that epimorphisms are surjective (ES). It is shown that the lattice of subvarieties of RUNO1 is a Boolean lattice of 32 elements. The bases for all the subvarieties of RUNO1 are also given. We introduce a new logic called mathcal{RUNO1} and show that it is algebraizable with the variety RUNO1 as its equivalent algebraic semantics. We then present axiomatizations for all 32 axiomatic extensions of mathcal{RUNO1} and deduce that all the axiomatic extensions are decidable. The paper ends with some open problems."}

Our scheme requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left((M + N^3\\log N)N_t\\right)$ work, where $N$ scales as $\\mathcal O(1/Δt)$, i.e., the maximum signal frequency. This is achieved by using the recently-proposed windowed Fourier projection (WFP) method to split the potential into a local part, evaluated directly, plus a smooth history part approximated by an $N^3$-point equispaced discretization of the Fourier transform, where each Fourier coefficient obeys a simple recursion relation. The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself. Thus, the method avoids the need for absorbing boundary conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with up to a million sources and targets at 6-digit accuracy.

In the same paper, Wiegold states that no obvious relations seem to hold between the pseudocentre and the canonical characteristic subgroups of a group.\n  The aim of this work is to show that the pseudocentre is indeed much more involved in the structure of an arbitrary group then anyone could have expected. For example, we prove that a soluble group coincides with its pseudocentre if and only if it is abelian, and that the structure of the commutator subgroup strongly influences the structure of the pseudocentre. And this is not the end of the story. In fact, the behaviour of the pseudocentre in arbitrary (possibly infinite) groups can be extremely wild: sometimes it is very difficult even to understand whether the pseudocentre is trivial or not. This wilderness is exampled by some of our main results (see the introduction for a complete list):\n  1) There exists a polycyclic group of Hirsch length 3 in which the pseudocentre is trivial. 2) The pseudocentre of the group of unitriangular matrices over any field is the largest term of the upper central series that is abelian. 3) Free products have a trivial pseudocentre, but there exist amalgamated free products of non-trivial groups coinciding with their pseudocentre. 4) Weakly regular branch groups have a trivial pseudocentre. 5) The pseudocentre of the Thompson group is the derived subgroup. 6) Wreath products can have a totally arbitrary pseudocentre."}

Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $α$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis.

Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches."}

To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified.

This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m."}

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions."}

We introduce the filter extension property for permutation models and symmetric extensions, which formalizes the naïve approach to extend arbitrary filters to ultrafilters by repeatedly extending filters by minimal increments. We use this framework to give the first direct proof of $\\mathrm{BPI}$ in the generalized Cohen model $N(I,Q)$ -- a model that adds a Dedekind-finite set of mutually $Q$-generic filters over a ground model $M\\vDash\\mathrm{ZFC}$. In the case that the index set $I$ is large, we adapt Harrington's proof of the Halpern-Läuchli theorem to prove the result. We then extend the results from Karagila and Schlicht to show that $I$ can be assumed to be large without loss of generality. The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension."}

We give explicit transition kernels in the case of labelled incomplete binary trees, which are closely related to known enumeration formulas. To establish these results, we study a decomposition of labelled trees into excursions above and below fixed label levels, yielding a forest structure with tractable probabilistic laws.\n  We further explain briefly how these findings connect to the theory of super-Brownian motion and the Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion (ISE).

Recent advances use kernel methods to estimate nonparametric causal relationships, with general data types, while retaining a simple closed-form expression. Empirical researchers ultimately need reliable inference on causal estimates; however, uniform confidence sets for the method remain unavailable. To fill this gap, we develop valid and sharp confidence sets for kernel instrumental variable regression, allowing general nonlinearities and data types. Computationally, our bootstrap procedure requires only a single run of the kernel instrumental variable regression estimator. Theoretically, it relies on the same key assumptions. Overall, we provide a practical procedure for inference that substantially increases the value of kernel methods for causal analysis."}

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models."}

Precisely, we show that if the initial perturbation satisfies $$\\|v_{in}-(y, 0, 0)\\|_{\\tilde{H}(\\mathbb T \\times \\mathbb D)}\\leq ε_0 \\,\\mathrm{Re}^{-α},$$ with any $α>\\frac 23$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6 \\cap W^{3,1}$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}^2$, and with any $α\\geq\\frac 56$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{T}$, the corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system exists globally in time and remains asymptotically close to the Couette flow. The main analytical challenge arises from the anisotropic nature of the estimates for the zero modes and from the interactions between zero and non-zero modes, which we address using an anisotropic Sobolev space directly tailored to the zero modes. Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold."}

High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability."}

However, the utility of RAR is contingent on regularization methods to mitigate early instability and preserve statistical integrity. A standard regularization approach is the ''burn-in'' period, an initial phase of equal randomization before treatment allocation adapts based on accrued data. The length of this burn-in is a critical design parameter, yet its selection remains unsystematic and improvised, as no established guideline exists. A poorly chosen length poses significant risks: one that is too short leads to high estimation bias and type-I error rate inflation, while one that is too long impedes the intended patient and power benefits of using adaptation. The challenge of selecting the burn-in generalizes to a fundamental question: what is the statistically appropriate timing for the first adaptation? We introduce the first systematic framework for determining burn-in length. This framework synthesizes core factors - total sample size, problem difficulty, and two novel metrics (reactivity and expected final allocation error) - into a single, principled formula. Simulation studies, grounded in real-world designs, demonstrate that lengths derived from our formula successfully stabilize the trial. The formula identifies a ''sweet spot'' that mitigates type-I error rate inflation and mean-squared error, preserving the advantages of higher power and patient benefit. This framework moves researchers from conjecture toward a systematic, reliable approach."}

The main object of combinatorial game theory is to obtain the outcome, which player has a winning strategy, of a given combinatorial game. Positions of many well-known combinatorial games are naturally decomposed into a disjunctive sum of multiple components and can be analyzed independently for each component. Therefore, the study of disjunctive sums is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. Combinatorial games in which both players have the same set of possible moves for every position are called impartial games. In the normal-play convention, it is known that the outcome of a disjunctive sum of impartial games can be obtained by computing the Grundy number of each term. The theory of impartial games is generalized in various forms. This paper proposes another generalization of impartial games to a new framework, impartial games with activeness: each game is assigned a status of either ``active'' or ``inactive''; the status may change by moves; a disjunctive sum of games ends immediately, not only when no further moves can be made, but also when all terms become inactive. We formally introduce impartial games with activeness and investigate their fundamental properties."}

We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system.

Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles.

In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent \"ghost\" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity.

Although a closed-form estimator is available for the Lasso penalty, adaptive extensions of widely used penalized approaches, including the Adaptive Lasso and Adaptive Group Lasso, have remained without analogous theoretical characterization. This paper presents the first unbiased estimator of the effective degrees of freedom for these methods, along with their main theoretical properties, for both orthogonal and non-orthogonal designs, derived within Stein's unbiased risk estimation framework. The resulting expressions feature inflation terms influenced by the regularization parameter, coefficient signs, and least-squares estimates. These advances enable more accurate model selection criteria and unbiased prediction error estimates, illustrated through synthetic and real data. These contributions offer a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding model complexity in adaptive regression, bridging a critical gap between theory and practice."}

This method employs an alternating iterative scheme, where each iteration entails solving two systems of equations with symmetric real coefficient matrices. This design is intended to reduce the high computational costs associated with complex arithmetic. Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters. When the eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions, the method guarantees convergence for any positive iteration parameter. Building on this insight, we developed the preconditioned lopsided HSS iteration method (PLHSS). Theoretical results demonstrate that PLHSS exhibits superior convergence properties compared to the original method. Additionally, we derived the optimal parameters for the new approaches and corresponding optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we derive the PLHSS preconditioner on the basis of the iterative method. The eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are well-clustered, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with a specific inner product. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioned GMRES and COCG methods. LHSS iteration methods and the relevant preconditioners show mesh size independent and parameter-insensitive convergence behavior for the test numerical examples."}

This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions."}

For any graph $G$ with a $c$-partition $π=\\left\\{V_1,V_2,\\dots,V_k\\right\\}$, the coalition graph $CG(G,π)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V_1,V_2,\\dots, V_k$, corresponding one-to-one with the set $π$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $CG(G,π)$ if and only if the sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $π$. In [4], authors proved that for every graph $G$ there exist a graph $H$ and $c$-partition $π$ such that $CG(H,π)\\cong G$, and raised the question: Does there exist a graph $H^*$ of smaller order $n^*$ and size $m^*$ with a $c$-partition $π^*$ such that $CG(H^*,π^*)\\cong G$?. In this paper, we constructed a graph $H^*$ of small order and size and a $c$- partition $π^*$ such that $CG(H^*,π^*)\\cong G$. Recently, Haynes et al.[5] defined the coalition count $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum number of different coalition in any $c$-partition of $G$. We characterize all graphs $G$ with $c(G)=1$. Further, imposing some suitable conditions on coalition number, we study the properties of coalition count of graph."}

By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution.

For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error.\n  Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities."}

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions."}

The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem.

To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds.

It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and any $ε> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\\|H-H_k\\|_F \\leq ε\\|H\\|_F$ for $k = O(\\log n \\log(1/ε))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \\emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\\polylog(n, 1/ε)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\\log n \\log(1/ε))$ Hankel matrix $\\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors.

Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \\emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \\emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices."}

When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.\n  When $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \\emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.\n  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\\\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods."}

Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution.

The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, Mémoires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit.

Restricting the gauge group to a single $\\mathrm{U}(1)$, we study the charged black hole solution and perform a precise analysis of the properties of the dual geometry with the $\\mathrm{O}(1,2; \\mathbb{R})$-valued generalized metric. We comment on some aspects related to singularities and gauge dependence. We show that the classification program for higher derivative corrections can also be applied to the heterotic case. We further elucidate how a previously proposed solution to the equations of motion, parametrized in a manner fully non-perturbative in $α'$, can be extended to the scenario with $r$ abelian fields and the corresponding $\\mathrm{O}(1,1+r; \\mathbb{R})$ symmetry. We discuss some novel features of the solution for charged black holes."}

Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations."}

We introduce the filter extension property for permutation models and symmetric extensions, which formalizes the naïve approach to extend arbitrary filters to ultrafilters by repeatedly extending filters by minimal increments. We use this framework to give the first direct proof of $\\mathrm{BPI}$ in the generalized Cohen model $N(I,Q)$ -- a model that adds a Dedekind-finite set of mutually $Q$-generic filters over a ground model $M\\vDash\\mathrm{ZFC}$. In the case that the index set $I$ is large, we adapt Harrington's proof of the Halpern-Läuchli theorem to prove the result. We then extend the results from Karagila and Schlicht to show that $I$ can be assumed to be large without loss of generality. The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension."}
