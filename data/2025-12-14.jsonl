The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data."}

A key feature of these models is that transition rate kernels involve Dirac delta functions, which capture sudden, discontinuous state changes. Here, we study kinetic equations with transition rates of the form $$ T(x,y,u) = δ_{φ(x,y) - u}. $$ We establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for these systems and introduce a fully deterministic scheme, the \\emph{Mass Preserving Collocation Method}, which enables efficient, high fidelity simulation of models with multiple subsystems. We validate the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the solver on models with up to five subsystems, and compare its performance against two state-of-the-art agent-based methods: Tau-leaping and hybrid methods. Our scheme resolves subsystem distributions captured by these stochastic approaches while preserving mass numerically, requiring significantly less computational time and resources, and avoiding variability and hyperparameter tuning characteristic of these methods."}

Our focus is on computing constrained minimizers of functionals - or, equivalently, by considering the associated Euler-Lagrange equations - the solution of a class of eigenvalue problems that may involve nonlinearities in the eigenfunctions. We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective. Alongside a discussion of the metric-driven approach for a model problem, we also demonstrate its application to simulating the ground states of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates."}

Despite this, we show that the free boundary has a robust structure.\n  We decompose the free boundary into three parts: (1) a regular part that advances with finite speed in time; (2) a singular part consisting of points where the front attains infinite speed or nucleates, but with controlled space-time (i.e., $\\leq d-1$ parabolic) dimension; and (3) a jump component, which can have large dimension in a time slice, but which is contained in a space-time smooth graph and occurs only at a zero-dimensional set of times.

The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?\n  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying \"S-decoding polynomials\" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.\n  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions.

Unexpectedly, we show that maximal solutions have a transition zone that is open modulo a low-dimensional set: this allows us to apply obstacle problem theory for a finer regularity analysis. We further show that maximal solutions are in general non-universal, and we obtain sharp stability results under perturbation of each maximal solution. Lastly, we study maximal solutions in both the radial and the one-dimensional setting. We show that in these cases the maximal solution is universal and minimizes nucleation, in agreement with phenomena observed in the physics literature."}

Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{é}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces."}

Existing projection methods rely on sorting and therefore incur an initial O(nlogn) complexity, which limits their scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this difficulty, we revisit the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the projection problem and introduce relaxed conditions that remain sufficient for characterizing the solution. These conditions lead to a simple geometric interpretation: finding the solutions is equivalent to locating the intersection of two monotone piecewise linear functions. Building on this insight, we propose an iterative and highly efficient algorithm that searches directly for the intersection point and completely avoids all sorting procedures. We prove that the algorithm converges globally and reaches the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. Extensive numerical experiments further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing algorithms and exhibits empirical O(n) complexity across a broad range of problem instances."}

Submitted to arXiv", "summary": "This work develops a comprehensive mathematical theory for a class of stochastic processes whose local regularity adapts dynamically in response to their own state. We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, Hölder-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-Hölder response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise Hölder regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches."}

Submitted to arXiv", "summary": "This work develops a comprehensive mathematical theory for a class of stochastic processes whose local regularity adapts dynamically in response to their own state. We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, Hölder-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-Hölder response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise Hölder regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches."}

As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena. This allows us to illustrate the critical role played by the underlying Riemann invariants in determining the system's macroscopic behavior."}

In contrast to classical results that require $b$ and $c$ to be bounded, we only assume that $b$ is bounded and $c$ satisfies a linear growth condition, while the solution $u$ is allowed to have at most exponential quadratic growth. The key innovation is a weighted $L^2$ framework that uses the backward Mehler kernel as a weight, which naturally encodes the underlying measure and compensates for the unbounded coefficients. From the frequency monotonicity, we derive the strong unique continuation principle. This extends Poon's seminal results and complements recent geometric generalizations by Colding and Minicozzi in the context of Gaussian measure spaces.

This study introduces an innovative conceptual and methodological framework for simulating wildfire propagation and estimating the rate of spread using a hybrid geometric and data-driven approach that relies exclusively on multi-source satellite observations. The framework integrates thermal fire-front detections, atmospheric conditions, and vegetation indices using two complementary geometric modeling strategies. The first strategy applies the Huygens principle, where generalized elliptical frames are expanded locally at every point along the fire perimeter, and their combined envelope forms the evolving wavefront. This method is best suited for situations in which environmental variables are available and can be incorporated to refine the anisotropic spread function. The second strategy relies solely on the generalized elliptical frames themselves; for each time step, an elliptical frame is constructed from the inferred head and back rates of spread and wind, and the burned area is obtained by enclosing the region determined by these curves. Together, these two methods provide a flexible toolkit that adapts to both data-rich and data-limited conditions while retaining a unified geometric interpretation of wildfire spread. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we present a case study based on the Eaton Fire, January 2025, using publicly available multi-day satellite imagery. Despite the absence of complete operational datasets for that event, the model driven only by satellite-derived parameters reproduces key qualitative features of the observed propagation pattern, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach in data-limited contexts."}

Given a probability measure $μ$ on a space $E$ and a diffeomorphism $ψ: E \\to F$, concentration properties transfer covariantly: if the pushforward $ψ_*μ$ concentrates, so does $μ$ in the pullback geometry. This reveals that classical concentration inequalities -- Hoeffding, Bernstein, Talagrand, Gaussian isoperimetry -- are manifestations of a single principle of \\emph{geometric invariance}. The choice of coordinate system $ψ$ becomes a free parameter that can be optimized. We prove that for any distribution class $\\Pc$, there exists an optimal diffeomorphism $ψ^*$ minimizing the concentration constant, and we characterize $ψ^*$ in terms of the Fisher-Rao geometry of $\\Pc$. We establish \\emph{strict improvement theorems}: for heavy-tailed or multiplicative data, the optimal $ψ$ yields exponentially tighter bounds than the identity. We develop the full theory including transportation-cost inequalities, isoperimetric profiles, and functional inequalities, all parametrized by the diffeomorphism group $\\Diff(E)$.

On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order.

The area can be viewed as a natural extension of that of variational inequalities. Variational-hemivariational inequalities are valuable for application problems from physical sciences and engineering that involve non-smooth and even set-valued relations, monotone or non-monotone, among physical quantities. In the recent years, there has been substantial growth of research interest in modeling, well-posedness analysis, development of numerical methods and numerical algorithms of variational-hemivariational inequalities. This survey paper is devoted to a brief account of well-posedness and numerical analysis results for variational-hemivariational inequalities. The theoretical results are presented for a family of abstract stationary variational-hemivariational inequalities and the main idea is explained for an accessible proof of existence and uniqueness. To better appreciate the distinguished feature of variational-hemivariational inequalities, for comparison, three mechanical problems are introduced leading to a variational equation, a variational inequality, and a variational-hemivariational inequality, respectively. The paper also comments on mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities, with examples from applications in fluid mechanics, and on results concerning the numerical solution of other types (nonstationary, history dependent) of variational-hemivariational inequalities."}

In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs.\n  The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power."}

This value emerges as a geometric attractor identified from exactly 18 primitive triangle families, whose completeness is supported by Diophantine constraints and extensive computational searches. The methodology connects three classical mathematical frameworks: De Moivre s theorem (1707), Chebyshev polynomials (1854), and results on the finiteness of integral points. Extended searches expanding the parameter space by a factor of 15 yield no new families, confirming saturation. The constant V0 connects to the Koide formula through Delta = 2/3 - V0 and approximates cos(13*pi/48) to 0.06 percent, suggesting links to cyclotomic fields. Using only dimensionless quantities, we obtain the electron anomaly ae with precision 0.15 ppb, the muon anomaly a_mu with 17 ppb, and the tau anomaly a_tau with 3.4 ppm. The framework is phenomenological and does not claim a derivation from quantum field theory, but its mathematical constraints yield testable predictions for future precision measurements."}

Our approach reduces dimensionality compared with the standard product space technique, which typically reformulates the original problem as the sum of two maximally monotone operators in order to apply splitting methods. It accommodates different cocoercive or Lipschitz constants as well as different resolvent parameters, and yields a larger allowable step-size range than in product space reformulations. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach by a numerical experiment on the decentralized fused lasso problem."}

In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover."}

The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $Δu^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself."}

Empirically, reducing the number of significant bits through rounding often leads to instances that are easier to solve. One reason can be that the amount of symmetries increases, which enables solvers to be more effective when they are exploited. This can signify that the original instance contains 'almost symmetries'. Furthermore, solving the rounded problems provides approximations to the original objective values. We empirically investigate these relations on instances of the capacitated facility location problem, the knapsack problem and a diverse collection of additional instances, using the solvers SCIP and CP-SAT. For all investigated problem classes, we show empirically that this yields faster algorithms with guaranteed solution quality. The influence of symmetry depends on the instance type and solver."}

Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings.

The method leverages an interplay between exploration of the energy landscape of the objective function through a system of interacting particles subject to stochasticity and exploitation of the particles' positions through the computation of a global consensus about the location of the minimizer based on the Laplace principle. In this paper, we prove strong mean square convergence of the practical numerical time-discrete CBO algorithm to the global minimizer for a rich class of objective functions. For CBO with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, our convergence result features conditions on the choice of the hyperparameters as well as explicit rates of convergence in the time discretization step size $Δt$ and the number of particles $N$. By interpreting the time-discrete algorithm at the continuous-time level through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), our proof strategy combines traditional finite-time convergence theory for numerical methods applied to SDEs with careful considerations due to the fact that the CBO coefficients do not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. To accomodate the latter, we adopt a recently proposed generalization of Sznitman's classical argument, which allows to discard an event of small probability, controllable through fine moment estimates for the particle systems."}

Inspired by Lew's foundational techniques for vertex-weighted Laplacians, we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of this operator. First, we determine how basic operations, including joins, complements, and Alexander duals, affect its spectrum. This yields a sharp upper bound on the spectral radius in terms of vertex weights, along with a lower bound on the multiplicity at which this bound is attained. Second, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap and characterize when the equality holds. Third, explicit lower bounds for the remaining eigenvalues are derived, linking the vertex-weighted Laplacian spectrum to that of a related weighted graph. Finally, we reveal new spectral relations between a simplicial complex and its subcomplexes. These results not only generalize numerous known theorems on combinatorial Laplacians but also provide deeper spectral insights into simplicial structures, ultimately unifying and extending a broad range of earlier work in this field."}

Special cases of these are the depth of partitionability, the depth of producibility (or simply entanglement depth) and the depth of stretchability, which are based on one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties known earlier. We also construct some further physically meaningful properties, for instance the squareability, the toughness, the degree of freedom, and also several ones of entropic motivation. Metrological multipartite entanglement criteria with the quantum Fisher information fit naturally into this framework. Here we formulate these for the depth of squareability, which therefore turns out to be the natural choice, leading to stronger bounds than the usual entanglement depth. Namely, the quantum Fisher information turns out to provide a lower bound not only on the maximal size of entangled subsystems, but also on the average size of entangled subsystems for a random choice of elementary subsystems. We also formulate criteria with convex quantities for both cases, which are much stronger than the original ones. In particular, the quantum Fisher information puts a lower bound on the average size of entangled subsystems. We also argue that one-parameter partial entanglement properties, which carry entropic meaning, are more suitable for the purpose of defining metrological bounds."}

We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\\Im (ω,\\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(ω,\\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $ω\\cdot \\Im G(ω,\\vec k) \\ge 0$ for real $(ω,\\vec k)$.

Our method combines algorithms for synthetic vascular generation with a physics-informed training procedure that integrates graph topological information and local flow dynamics. To ensure the physical reliability of the learned surrogates, we incorporate a physics-informed loss functional derived from the governing equations, allowing enforcement of mass conservation and rheological constraints.

The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction."}

The first is about vectors: how long can a sequence of vectors in $[n]^q$ be if, for all pairs in the sequence, the later vector is strictly larger than the earlier in at least $q-1$ coordinates? The second is graph-theoretic: given a $q$-edge-coloring of a tournament, how long of a directed path can we guarantee whose edges avoid one of the colors? These problems arise naturally in many areas, such as convex geometry and extremal hypergraph theory, and have been extensively studied over the past 50 years.\n  We prove that if $\\varepsilon>0$ is fixed and $q$ is sufficiently large, then every $N$-vertex tournament contains a color-avoiding directed path of length $N^{1-\\varepsilon}$. Consequently, the maximum length of a $(q-1)$-increasing sequence of vectors in $[n]^q$ has length at most $n^{1+\\varepsilon}$. Our results answer a question of Gowers and Long, strengthen several of their results, and extend earlier works of Tiskin and Loh."}

What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Not even ``Pythagoras' theorem'' was discovered by Pythagoras, as is now well-known. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lemaître's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more."}

The generator arises by incorporating two shape parameters from the Harris-G framework into the alpha power transformation, resulting in a more flexible class for modelling survival and reliability data. A special member of this family, obtained using the two-parameter Burr XII distribution as the baseline, is developed and examined in detail. Several analytical properties of the proposed alpha power Harris Burr XII (APHBXII) model are derived, which include closed-form expressions for its moments, mean and median deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, order statistics, and Renyi and Tsallis entropies. Parameter estimation is performed via maximum likelihood, and a Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of the estimators. In addition, three real lifetime datasets are analyzed to evaluate the empirical performance of the APHBXII distribution relative to four competing models. The results show that the five-parameter APHBXII model provides superior fit across all datasets, as supported by model-selection criteria and goodness-of-fit statistics."}

While existing research heavily focuses on applications for undirected graphs such as community detection and core extraction, there have been relatively less attention on directed graphs.\n  In this paper, we introduce a definition of Ricci curvature and an accompanying curvature flow for directed graphs. Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection. Due to their extreme weight, these added edges are automatically discarded during the final iteration of the Ricci curvature flow.\n  For core evaluation, our approach consistently surpasses traditional methods, achieving better results on at least two out of three key metrics.

To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy.

Previous investigations have fully characterized the property for trees, established it for cycles, extended it to unicyclic graphs, and shown that bipartite graphs with a perfect matching always satisfy property $(P)$. However, whether the converse holds for connected bipartite graphs remains open in general.\n  In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question on multiple fronts. We first prove that every connected bipartite graph satisfying property $(P)$ must be balanced, providing a fundamental necessary condition. We further establish complete characterizations for several significant families of bipartite graphs. Specially, we show that every connected bipartite graph of order at most $8$ has property $(P)$ if and only if it has a perfect matching, and more generally, that a connected bipartite graph of order $8+2k$ with at least $k$ pendant edges satisfies property $(P)$ exactly when it has a perfect matching. We further prove that within the class of triangular bipartite graphs, property $(P)$ is equivalent to the existence of a perfect matching, providing a full characterization for this broad structural subclass.\n  In addition, we introduce the threaded union over a graph, a general operation for assembling larger graphs from smaller components, and show that threaded union over a tree--cycle block graph preserves property $(P)$. This significantly generalizes earlier result about joining two graphs with property $(P)$ by a single edge preserves property $(P)$."}

Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources."}

The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $Δu^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself."}

We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, Hölder-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-Hölder response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise Hölder regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches."}

Properties of generalized Spearman correlation are investigated when the functions are piecewise continuous and strictly monotonic, with particular focus on the special cases where the functions are drawn from orthonormal bases defined by Legendre polynomials and cosine functions. For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated.

Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters. This expression is obtained by partitioning the state-space into different regions, with a different closed-form solution in each region. We leverage this formula to introduce a resource-aware implementation of CBF-based safety filters that detects changes in the partition region and uses the closed-form expression between changes. We showcase the applicability of our approach in examples ranging from aerospace control to safe reinforcement learning."}

In concave games, where players' strategy sets are compact and convex, and their payoffs are concave in their own actions, strong guarantees follow: Nash equilibria always exist and decentralized algorithms converge to equilibria. If the game is furthermore monotone, an even stronger guarantee holds: Nash equilibria are unique under strictness assumptions. Unfortunately, we show that certifying concavity or monotonicity is NP-hard, already for games where utilities are multivariate polynomials and compact, convex basic semialgebraic strategy sets -- an expressive class that captures extensive-form games with imperfect recall. On the positive side, we develop two hierarchies of sum-of-squares programs that certify concavity and monotonicity of a given game, and each level of the hierarchies can be solved in polynomial time. We show that almost all concave/monotone games are certified at some finite level of the hierarchies.

We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals."}

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance."}

Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system."}

The projections of Brownian motions on $V$ with drifts are also Feller diffusions on $C$, and their transition densities and their generators can be again described via these Bessel functions. These processes are called Bessel processes with drifts. In this paper we construct these Bessel processes processes with drift for arbitrary root systems and parameters $k\\ge 0$. Moreover, this construction works also for Dunkl processes. We study some features of these processes with drift like their radial parts, a Girsanov theorem, moments and associated martingales, strong laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems."}

We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system."}

We set temperature, chemical potential and coupling constant in a regime where classical field theory gives leading order asymptotics. In the same limit, the repulsive interaction potential is set to be short-range: it converges to a Dirac delta function with a rate depending polynomially on the other scaling parameters. We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $Φ^4_2$ non-linear Schr{ö}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity.
