The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks\n(HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields\nan exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics\nare advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified\nneural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic\nstructure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and\nlong-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through\ncomprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems.

For the numerical solution, we use a\nfinite element approximation in space and present an efficient multiscale\ntwo-grid solver for solving the coupled system of equations. The proposed\ntwo-grid solver contains two main parts: (i) accurate coarse grid approximation\nbased on local spectral spaces and (ii) coupled smoothing iterations based on\nan overlapping multiscale Vanka method. A Vanka smoother and local spectral\ncoarse grids come with significant computational cost in the setup phase. To\navoid constructing a new solver for each time step and/or nonlinear iteration,\nwe utilize an implicit-explicit integration scheme in time, where we partition\nthe nonlinear operator as a sum of linear and nonlinear parts. In particular,\nwe construct an implicit linear approximation of the stiff components that\nremains fixed across all time, while treating the remaining nonlinear residual\nexplicitly. This allows us to construct a robust two-grid solver offline and\nutilize it for fast and efficient online time integration. A linear stability\nanalysis of the proposed novel coupled scheme is presented based on the\nrepresentation of the system as a two-step scheme. We show that the careful\ndecomposition of linear and nonlinear parts guarantees a linearly stable\nscheme. A numerical study is presented for a two-dimensional nonlinear coupled\ntest problem of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous poroelastic media. We\ndemonstrate the robustness of the two-grid solver, particularly the efficacy of\nblock smoothing compared with simple pointwise smoothing, and illustrate the\naccuracy and stability of implicit-explicit time integration."}

However, convergence is not guaranteed and semi-convergence\nmay be observed.\n  Our aims are two-fold: (1) To obtain theoretical and physical insight into\nthe regimes in which rapid convergence occurs and the mechanisms by which it\nfails, by examining and modifying eigenvalues of the operator; (2) provide a\nstrategy for increasing the speed of convergence or more crucially for\novercoming divergence, and providing a stopping criterion. The first is\naddressed by subtracting successive dominant eigenvectors from the incident\nfield, to examine the impact on divergence and on the incident spectrum. For\nthe second, we apply a generalisation of Shanks' transformation to the operator\nseries; this effectively improves convergence and (unlike eigenvalue\nsubtraction) readily generalises to 3D and composite problems. These results\nalso explain why the method converges so rapidly for much larger incident\nangles.

The proof requires a bound on the joint\nprobability density function of a two-dimensional random vector whose\ncomponents are the solution to the {\\em nonlinear} stochastic heat equation and\nthe supremum over a small rectangle of the solution to the {\\em linear}\nstochastic heat equation, in terms of the size of the rectangle. This bound\nmakes use of a formula that expresses the density of a {\\em locally\nnondegenerate} random vector as an iterated Skorohod integral. The main effort\nis to estimate, using Malliavin calculus, each of the terms that arise from\nthis formula."}

Although stochastic noise has been\nthe primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations\nmight fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature\nor simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we\nemploy the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible\nuncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard\nrobust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or\nnon-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To\naddress this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly\nreduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the\nframework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic\nuncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution\nsteering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach\nbased on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a\nconvergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity.

The character\nof each geometry is uniquely determined by its Inertia Group-the group of\nspacetime transformations that preserves its privileged class of inertial\nmotions. We trace the three major epistemological ruptures in the history of\nmechanics by translating foundational physical principles into the unambiguous\nlanguage of group theory. The analysis begins with Aristotelian mechanics,\nwhere absolute Space and Time are shown to be homogeneous spaces of the Group\nof Aristotle, defined by its preservation of rest. The second rupture, driven\nby the relativity of motion (Bruno, Galileo), leads to the abandonment of\nabsolute Space and the construction of the Galilean Group, which preserves the\nclass of uniform rectilinear motions. The final rupture, precipitated by the\ncrisis in electromagnetism, results in the dissolution of absolute Time and the\nemergence of the Poincar\\'e Group, preserving affine lines and the Minkowski\nmetric. Central results of this approach are theorems demonstrating, with\nmathematical certainty, the non-existence of a Galilean-invariant \"Space\" and a\nPoincar\\'e-invariant \"Time,\" where invariance is defined with respect to the\naction of the corresponding inertia group. This geometric framework provides a\nunified perspective on the transition from classical to modern physics and\nallows for a rigorous distinction between 'primary' epistemological ruptures,\nwhich alter the Inertia Group itself, and 'secondary' ruptures, which introduce\nnew formalisms for the management of dynamics within a stable geometry."}

A class\nof network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to\nbalance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust,\ne.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are\ndeployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network\nparameters in response to different operational requirements, including the\nneed to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic\nand adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to\ninform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in\nregimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and\nlower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the\nnumber of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a\nstronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the\npresence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based\non pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial\nnodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics\nthat are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way\nfor end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable\ninference on networks."}

Using a\nfixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in\nthe space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are\nmyopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of\nthe system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for\ncomputing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its\nnumerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on\ninland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A\nseries of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence\nof the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon."}

Sparsity ensures communication overhead\nremains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and\ninference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class\nof network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to\nbalance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust,\ne.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are\ndeployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network\nparameters in response to different operational requirements, including the\nneed to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic\nand adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to\ninform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in\nregimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and\nlower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the\nnumber of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a\nstronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the\npresence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based\non pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial\nnodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics\nthat are closely tied to privacy guarantees.

The\nanswer to the central question of the paper requires studying the crossing\npoints of the cdf of the original difference with the cdfs of its comonotonic\nand countermonotonic transforms. The analysis is supplemented with a numerical\nstudy of longevity trend bonds, using different mortality models and population\ndata. The numerical study reveals that for these mortality-linked securities\nthe three pairs of cdfs generally have unique pairwise crossing points. Under\nsymmetric copulas, all crossing points can reasonably be approximated by the\ndifference of the marginal medians, but this approximation is not necessarily\nvalid for asymmetric copulas.

IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nblack-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that\nmaximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not\nrequire gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike\ngradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the\nobjective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current\nsolution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from\nscalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially\nwhen applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes\nthe Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search\napproach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood\nformulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of\nthe IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested\nour method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various\ngreedy techniques and heuristics.

Here, we\ndemonstrate that L\\\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the\nwidely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and\nquantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and\nsuperposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a\nnon-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set,\nthereby avoiding any ambiguity related to the basis choice for quantum\ncoherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO\napplies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and\nminimizes deviation from the original basis. This approach generates basis sets\nwith enhanced stability and physical relevance, facilitating the analysis of\nsuperpositions in non-orthogonal quantum states. Building on LSO, we also\nintroduce L\\\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal\nrepresentations that provide a consistent measure of resource content.

Causal decompositions are circuit\ndecompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions\nare made apparent simultaneously.
