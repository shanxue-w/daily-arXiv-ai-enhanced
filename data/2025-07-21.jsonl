Contact lens mechanical interactions with the\nocular surface have been found to affect the ocular surface. The mechanical\ninteractions between the contact lens and the eye are difficult to measure and\ncalculate in the clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited.\nThis paper presents the first mathematical model that couples the interaction\nbetween the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens\nconfiguration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape\nare all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the\ncontact lens and the eye is achieved assuming the the suction pressure under\nthe lens is applied directly to the ocular surface, neglecting the post-lens\ntear film layer. The contact lens dynamics is modeled using a previous\npublished model. We consider a homogeneous and a heterogeneous linear elastic\neye model, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and lens thickness\nprofiles, and extract lens deformation, lens suction pressure profiles, and\nocular deformations and stresses for all the scenarios considered. The model\npredicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and\nin the limbal/scleral region. Accounting for a heterogeneous material eye\nparameters increases such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements\nand stresses increase non-linearly as we increase the stiffness of the contact\nlens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the\nocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the\nedge of the contact lens. The model predictions are compared to experimental\ndata and previously developed mathematical models."}

The other quasi-metric is an\nextension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy\nbetween sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these\nquasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected\nobjects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The\nT-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the\nGOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of\npenalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation\ncosts are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT\nevaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT\nalgorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations."}

However,\neffective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of\ndeformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an\nopen issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact\nor, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact\nplanes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that\nserve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions\nfor detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture\nthat utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,\nincorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable\nbodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft\ntissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic\nvalve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the\nloss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits\nhold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and\ncomplex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also\ndemonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.\nHowever, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,\nresulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the\ntraining cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware\narchitectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in\nup to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference."}

The\nattached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is\nshown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of\nan arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and\nits quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H.\nGarland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre\nconstruction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the\ncenter of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop\ngroups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently\nChaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space.\nThis partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient."}

We introduce a class of combinatorial objects called bitableaux,\nwhich we believe are a natural candidate, and we formulate a purely\ncombinatorial problem which if resolved would give a combinatorial\ninterpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. We make some partial progress on\nthis problem -- enough to extract a combinatorial expansion for a Kronecker\nproduct of Schur functions in the monomial basis. We also explain how in this\nframework finding a combinatorial interpretation for Kronecker coefficients can\nbe thought of as looking for a generalization of the RSK and dual RSK insertion\nalgorithms."}

We prove a two-term asymptotics for the ground state\nenergy per unit volume in the dilute limit. Our proof justifies the expectation\nthat optimal configurations consist of droplets of unit size that arrange\nthemselves according to minimizers for the Jellium problem for point particles.\nIn particular, we provide the first rigorous derivation of what is known as the\ngnocchi phase in astrophysics."}
