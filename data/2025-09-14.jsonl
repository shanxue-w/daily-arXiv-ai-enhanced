For a thin plate, the defining size\nis its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin\nobjects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to\nbypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a\nsimple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex\nmaterial model on a coarser mesh.

Within this framework, we show that\nseveral regularized DDPC formulations, including l1-norm penalties,\nprojection-based regularizers, and a newly introduced causality-based\nregularizer, can be viewed as convex relaxations of their respective bi-level\nproblems. This perspective clarifies the conceptual links between direct and\nindirect data-driven control and highlights how regularization implicitly\nenforces system identification. We further propose an optimality-based variant,\nO-DDPC, which approximately solves the inner problem with all identification\nconstraints via an iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that\nO-DDPC outperforms existing regularized DDPC by reducing both bias and variance\nerrors. These results indicate that further benefits may be obtained by\napplying system identification techniques to pre-process the trajectory library\nin nonlinear settings.

The\nproblem becomes more challenging in the case of stochastic\ndifferential-algebraic equations (SDAEs) due to the singularity of the matrix.\nTo address this, we build a new scheme called the semi-implicit tamed method\nfor SDAEs and provide its strong convergence result under non-global Lipschitz\nsetting.

We analyze how delays affect the spatial\nlocality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the\nspatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay,\nwe provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for\ninfinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive\ncontrol regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware\nfiltering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free\nsetting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the\ndelay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our\nanalytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a\nmulti-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays\nreduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each\nsubsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away\nlocations."}

In this paper, we\npresent a unifying {two-system} framework that brings all three under one roof.\nIn our approach, an ensemble of particles is split into two interacting\nsubsystems that propose updates for each other in a symmetric, alternating\nfashion. This cross-system interaction ensures that the overall ensemble has\n$\\rho(x)$ as its invariant distribution in both the finite-particle setting and\nthe mean-field limit. The two-system construction reveals that ensemble-chain\nsamplers can be interpreted as finite-$N$ approximations of an ideal mean-field\nsampler; conversely, it provides a principled recipe to discretize mean-field\nLangevin dynamics into tractable parallel MCMC algorithms. The framework also\nconnects naturally to adaptive single-chain methods: by replacing\nparticle-based statistics with time-averaged statistics from a single chain,\none recovers analogous adaptive dynamics in the long-time limit without\nrequiring a large ensemble. We derive novel two-system versions of both\noverdamped and underdamped Langevin MCMC samplers within this paradigm.

Interestingly, the symmetry of the\nconsidered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and\ncompromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this\nissue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected\nsymmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the\neffective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic\nerrors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to\nunbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected\nsymmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations,\nwe study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and\ntheir fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the\nsymmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures\nof industrial scale."}

Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to\nweak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry\nBreaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric\ndensity matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric\nrandom quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site\nrepresentation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be\nregarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to\nmore general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak\npostselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order\ntransition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly\nsymmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases\nand their transitions for both abelian $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$\nsymmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with\nmeasurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent\nin the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum\nchannels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the\ndegeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results\ndemonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of\nnoisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds\nof mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries."}
