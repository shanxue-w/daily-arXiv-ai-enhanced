The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two\nequations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of\ncriminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on\nchemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions,\nwe enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational\nformulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of\na finite element method. These conditions specify the value of the normal\nderivatives of the system variables at the boundary. For the numerical solution\nof the PDE problem discretized in time and space, we propose a scheme that\ndecouples the computation of the attractiveness from the computation of the\ncriminal density at each time step, resulting in the solution of two linear\nalgebraic systems per iteration. Through numerous numerical tests, we\ndemonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of this approach.\nLeveraging the flexibility allowed by the finite element method, we show\nresults for spatially heterogeneous model parameters and a realistic geometry\n(city of Chicago).

While gradient-free methods have been\ndeveloped for smooth nonconvex problems, extending these techniques to the\nnonsmooth setting remains challenging. The primary difficulty arises from the\nabsence of a Taylor series expansion for Clarke subdifferentials, which limits\nthe ability to approximate and analyze the behavior of the objective function\nin a neighborhood of a point. We propose a two time-scale zeroth-order\nprojected stochastic subgradient method leveraging Gaussian smoothing to\napproximate Clarke subdifferentials. First, we establish that the expectation\nof the Gaussian-smoothed subgradient lies within an explicitly bounded error of\nthe Clarke subdifferential, a result that extends prior analyses beyond\nconvex/smooth settings. Second, we design a novel algorithm with coupled\nupdates: a fast timescale tracks the subgradient approximation, while a slow\ntimescale drives convergence. Using continuous-time dynamical systems theory\nand robust perturbation analysis, we prove that iterates converge almost surely\nto a neighborhood of the set of Clarke stationary points, with neighborhood\nsize controlled by the smoothing parameter.

However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow\nimages that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or\ndevice-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem\nleverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field\nfrom noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through\nexperiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under\nvarying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic\ngeometry with signal-dependent noise.

To\noptimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and\noptimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for\nsensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG).\nExperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing\neffectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control\nalgorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force\nsearch."}

A net $(x_\\alpha)_{\\alpha\\in A}$ in a Riesz space $E$ is said to be rough\n$\\mathbb{c}$-convergent to $x\\in E$ if there exists a net\n$(y_\\alpha)_{\\alpha\\in A}$ in $E$ with $y_\\alpha \\xrightarrow[]{\\mathbb{c}}\n\\theta$ for a given background convergence $\\mathbb{c}$, such that\n$|x_\\alpha-x| \\leq y_\\alpha + \\mathbb{r}$ holds for all $\\alpha\\in A$, where\n$\\mathbb{r}$ is a fixed positive vector in $E$ representing the roughness\ndegree.

Advanced mathematical models governing these\ncoupled processes typically combine fluid flow, poroelasticity, and fracture\ncontact mechanics, representing fractures as co-dimension one objects within\nthe porous medium. The resulting system of equations is complex and highly\nnonlinear. As a result, convergence issues with nonlinear solvers are common,\nwhich hinders the practical implementation of such models.\n  One particular source of difficulty for the nonlinear solvers comes from the\nfracture contact mechanics, due to its inherently nonsmooth character. In this\npaper, we investigate solvers based on the augmented Lagrangian formulation of\nthe frictional contact problem. This includes two classical solvers, namely the\ngeneralized Newton method (using complementarity functions) and the return map\nmethod. In addition, we propose a new augmented Lagrangian solver that combines\nthe two approaches.\n  Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to assess the\nperformance of the solvers on problems of mixed-dimensional poromechanics with\nfracture contact mechanics. The experiments indicate that for simpler setups,\nthe solvers behave quite predictably and in accordance with established\nheuristics from the contact mechanics literature. However, as the complexity of\nthe problem increases, the solvers become more unpredictable, and break with\nthese heuristics. In particular, the two classical solvers become highly\nsensitive to the augmentation parameter. The new solver converges across a\nlarger range of this parameter in most cases, but nevertheless also displays\nunpredictable behavior."}

We demonstrate that the initial\nconditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency\nof the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest.\nAlthough in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the\nlaser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density\ndecreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral\ndensity shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser\npower is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation\npressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the\nclassical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme.\nSince the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a\nclassical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium\npoint of the pendulum of mirrors' motion.

To\ncapture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on\nthe Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent\ndeformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode,\nwhich in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting\ndynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend\nsolely on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange\ncoupling, and the Gilbert damping constant.

This implies that mean fitness should not decline in a constant\nenvironment, thereby positioning it as an indicator of evolutionary\nprogression. However, this theorem has been shown to lack universality. Here,\nwe derive the Fokker-Planck equation that describes the stochastic frequency\ndynamics of two phenotypes in a large population under weak selection and\ngenetic drift, and develop a path integral formulation that characterizes the\nprobability density of phenotypic frequency. Our formulation identifies that,\nunder both selection and genetic drift, the ratio of the probability density of\nadaptive traits (e.g., phenotypic frequency) to that under neutrality\nrepresents a time-invariant evolutionary path characteristic. This ratio\nquantifies the cumulative effect of directional selection on the evolutionary\nprocess compared to genetic drift. Importantly, the expected value of this\nratio does not decline over time. In the presence of fitness variance, the\neffect of directional selection on expected phenotypic changes accumulates over\ntime, diverging progressively from paths shaped solely by genetic drift. The\nexpectation of this time-invariant ratio thus offers a robust and informative\nalternative to mean fitness as a measure of progression in stochastic\nevolutionary dynamics."}

One class of Markov chains in wide use aims to sample\nfrom balanced tree-weighted $k$-partitions using a sampler for balanced\ntree-weighted 2-partitions.
