In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging\niterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to\nreach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods\nspecifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of\nimproving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of\n``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates\nto the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the\nbest known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the\nsequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the\niterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point\niterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself\nhas proven highly successful across various areas of physics.

The results include: the\nexistence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe\nthe limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic\nindependence (concentration, as $n \\to\\infty$, of the stationary distribution\non a single state, which is necessarily an ML fixed point); the limits, as $n\n\\to\\infty$, of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system\nadvances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and\ngeneralize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical development is such\nthat the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a\nunified framework. In particular, these systems are used as tools for analysis\nof each other."}

This paper introduces and develops\nthe general concept of exclusivity classes of loss functions: subsets of loss\nfunctions such that no estimator can be optimal (according to a specified\nnotion) for losses lying in different classes. We focus on the case of minmax\noptimality and define minmax exclusivity classes, demonstrating that the\nclassical family of power-type loss functions $L_p(\\theta,a) = |\\theta - a|^p$\nforms such a class. Under standard regularity and smoothness assumptions, we\nprove that no estimator can be simultaneously minmax for losses belonging to\ntwo distinct $L_p$ classes. This result is obtained via a perturbation argument\nrelying on differentiability of risk functionals and the conic structure of\nloss spaces.

The proposed model\nencodes the feature vector of a query, derived from term-frequency weights of a\nlanguage corpus by using a repetition code with an adaptive rate dependent on\nthe contextual importance of the terms. At the decoder, we select between two\ndocuments based on the contextual closeness of the recovered query. By\nleveraging a jointly Gaussian approximation for both the true and reconstructed\nsimilarity scores, we derive an explicit expression for the retrieval error\nprobability, i.e., the probability under which the less similar document is\nselected. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data (Google NQ)\nconfirm the validity of the analysis. They further demonstrate that assigning\ngreater redundancy to critical features effectively reduces the error rate,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of semantic-aware feature encoding in\nerror-prone communication settings."}

In this paper, we study\n$ex_{\\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{h,k})$ for all $1\\le h\\le 2\\le k\\le 5$, and obtain some\ntight bounds $ex_{\\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{h,k})\\leq\\frac{3(h+k)}{h+k+2}n$ for $3\\le\nh+k\\le 5$ with equality holds if $(h+k+2)\\mid n$, and\n$ex_{\\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{1,5})\\le \\frac{5}{2}n$ with equality holds if $12\\mid\nn$. Also we show that $\\frac{9}{4}n\\le ex_{\\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{2,4})\\le\n\\frac{5}{2}n$ and $\\frac{5}{2}n\\le ex_{\\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{2,5})\\le\n\\frac{17}{6}n$, respectively."}

Two\nefficiency criteria are proposed and studied: the maximum probability that a\nmessage about an event from a fixed device is successfully delivered to the\nbase station and the maximum frequency at which the base station successfully\nreceives updates about the entire system. For each criterion, we determine the\noptimal number of retransmissions as a function of the system parameters."}

Various approaches have been developed to\nloosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful\n(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort\nAssumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,\nwhich are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the\ncount of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role\nin classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If\none tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify\nthe count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of\nprobability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is\nsomething that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of\nthis paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience\nthat is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not\nnecessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful\ndiscussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the\nlink between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the\nmeasure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum\nmechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some\nproperties of this \"quantum measure\", its reasonableness in terms of the\nphysics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a\nset of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a\ngeneralization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended\nprobability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of\nphysically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes)."}

Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications,\nincluding Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set\nconjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings."}

Linear combinations of such functions are\ncalled graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention\nin counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx\n(STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*)\ninvolving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with\npositive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is\nimportant to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs\nG, even when some coefficients are negative.\n  Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative\ncoefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph\nis accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the\nrelativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner\n(SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our\napplication of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as\ngraphs do not have the required Ramsey property.\n  Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including\ncolored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over\ncategories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove\na general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a\ncombinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for\ncategories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces\nas well as parameter sets."}
