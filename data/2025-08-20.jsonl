However, their spectral\nproperties are not optimal, which limits the ability to capture high-frequency\nwaves and small-scale features. In this paper, we propose a data-driven\noptimized method to improve the spectral properties of the WENO schemes. By\nanalyzing the approximate dispersion relation (ADR), the spectral error of the\nschemes can be bounded by the reconstructed errors of a series of trigonometric\nfunctions with different wavenumbers. Therefore, we propose the new schemes\nWENO5-JS/Z-NN that introduce a compensation term parameterized by a neural\nnetwork to the weight function of the WENO5-JS/Z schemes. The neural network is\ntrained such that the generated weights can minimize the reconstructed errors\nover a large number of spatial stencils, and furthermore, improve the spectral\naccuracy. Meanwhile, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) constraint and\nanti-dissipation penalization are incorporated into the loss function to\nenhance the shock-capturing capability and preserve stability in simulating\nhigh-frequency waves. Compared to WENO5-JS/Z, our schemes maintain the ability\nto capture discontinuities while providing higher resolution for fine-scale\nflow features. The ADR indicates that the new schemes can match the exact\nspectrum more accurately over a broader range of wavenumbers."}

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications", "summary": "We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters\nare deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with\nsmall form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They\ncan be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent\nto the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with\namplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in\nrepeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive\nfeedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and\namplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be\nachieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more\ninterference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist\nstability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check\nstability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an\nefficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user\ntransmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum\nrate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our\ntheoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the\nsystem performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results\nalso warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for\nexample, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between\nrepeaters and the base station."}

We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In\nparticular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and\nthe uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning\nthe variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one\nvertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen\nat random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.\n  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon.

The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary.

Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances.

In this work, we\nintroduce a Predictive System-Level Synthesis PredSLS framework that designs\ncontrollers by jointly integrating communication constraints and local\ndisturbance predictions into an affine feedback structure. Rather than focusing\non the worst-case uncertainty, PredSLS leverages both current state feedback\nand future system disturbance predictions to achieve distributed control of\nnetworked systems. In particular, PredSLS enables a unified system synthesis of\nthe optimal $\\kappa$-localized controller, therefore outperforms approaches\nwith post hoc communication truncation, as was commonly seen in the literature.\nThe PredSLS framework can be naturally decomposed into spatial and temporal\ncomponents for efficient and parallelizable computation across the network,\nyielding a regret upper bound that explicitly depends on the prediction error\nand communication range. Our regret analysis not only reveals a non-monotonic\ntrade-off between control performance and communication range when prediction\nerrors are present, but also guides the identification of an optimal size for\nlocal communication neighborhoods, thereby enabling the co-design of controller\nand its underlying communication topology."}

It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its\ncomplexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms\nfor solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers\ninto qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by\nmapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value\ndue to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In\nthis work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum\nalgorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a\nquantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function\nthat efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a\nphase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation\ncoupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We\nprove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured\nin our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be\n$O(d^{n/2} + m\\cdot n^2\\cdot \\log{d} + n/\\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with\nthe number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$\nconstraints with a precision of $\\epsilon_{QPE}$.

The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances,\nwhich are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical\nparameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but\nwith a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances.
