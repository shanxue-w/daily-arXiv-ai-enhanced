The proposed scheme retains\nthe high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for\nlarge time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary\ncontribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the\nmatrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of\nVlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1)\na third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as\n$O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of\ncharacteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical\nadaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker\nformat, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in\nthe hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The\ncomputed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within\nbranches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in\nboth storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational\ncomplexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\\lceil\\log_2d\\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of\ngrid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum\nrank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through\nextensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures\nwhile maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$."}

We introduce Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation (IDDA),\nwhich modifies how discrepancies enter the governing equations. Rather than\nadding observations as a forcing term alone, IDDA also adjusts the nonlinear\noperator using interpolated observational information. This structural change\nsuppresses error amplification when nonlinear effects dominate. We prove\nexponential convergence under explicit conditions linking error decay to\nobservation spacing, nudging strength, and diffusion coefficient. The key\nrequirement establishes bounds on nudging strength relative to observation\nspacing and diffusion, giving practitioners a clear operating window. When\nobservations resolve the relevant scales, error decays at a user-specified\nrate. Critically, the error bound scales with the square of observation spacing\nrather than through hard-to-estimate nonlinear growth rates. We validate IDDA\non Burgers flow, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics, and two-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes turbulence. Across these tests, IDDA reaches target accuracy\nfaster than standard interpolated nudging, remains stable in chaotic regimes,\navoids non-monotone transients, and requires minimal parameter tuning. Because\nIDDA uses standard explicit time integration, it fits readily into existing\nsimulation pipelines without specialized solvers. These properties make IDDA a\npractical upgrade for operational systems constrained by sparse sensor\ncoverage."}

Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered\nconsiderable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.\nHowever, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those\nbased on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to\nreference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high\ncomputational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook\ndesigns. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for\nvehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is\ndesigned to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline\ntraining, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference\nsignal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction\narchitecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain\ninformation of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic\nchannels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior\nperformance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit\nerror rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided\nschemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular\ncommunications."}

The\nattained sample complexities improve those of existing zeroth-order methods in\nthe problem setting that allows nonconvexity and unboundedness of the objective\nfunction.

In our first algorithm, spontaneous occurrence\nof symbols is possible. This means that there is a positive probability that\nthe chain chooses the next symbol independently of the past.

However, the practical deployment of such systems presents\nunique technical challenges, stemming from severe propagation loss,\nfrequency-dependent molecular absorption in the THz band, and the presence of\nstrong residual self-interference (SI) inherent to FD communications. To tackle\nthese issues, this paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that\naims to maximize the weighted minimum rate among all users, thereby ensuring\nfairness in quality of service. Specifically, the proposed design jointly\noptimizes IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control,\nsub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment, explicitly capturing\nthe unique propagation characteristics of THz channels and the impact of\nresidual SI. To strike an balance between system performance and computational\ncomplexity, two computationally efficient algorithms are developed under\ndistinct spectrum partitioning schemes: one assumes equal sub-band bandwidth\nallocation to facilliate tractable optimization, while the other introduces\nadaptive bandwidth allocation to further enhance spectral utilization and\nsystem flexibility.

The\narchitecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer\nimplementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired\nby normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the\nmanifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that\noptimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a\ndual-objective loss function.

Moreover, these subdomains may\nchange in time as the water flows through the domain. This motivates the need\nfor space and time adaptivity in the simulation of shallow free surface flows.\nIn this paper, we develop the first adaptive simulations using the recently\ndeveloped Shallow Water Moment Equations, which are an extension of the\nstandard Shallow Water Equations that allow for vertically changing velocity\nprofiles by including additional variables and equations. The model-specific\nmodeling complexity of a shallow water moment model is determined by its order.\nThe higher the order of the model, the more variables and equations are\nincluded in the model. Shallow water moment models are ideally suited for\nadaptivity because they are hierarchical such that low-order models and\nhigh-order models share the same structure. To enable adaptive simulations, we\npropose two approaches for the coupling of the varying-order shallow water\nmoment equations at their boundary interfaces. The first approach dynamically\nupdates padded state variables but cannot be written in conservative form,\nwhile the second approach uses fixed padded state variable values of zero and\nreduces to conservative form for conservative moment equations. The switching\nprocedure between high-order models and low-order models is based on a new set\nof model error estimators, originating from a decomposition of the high-order\nmodels.

We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,\nwhere a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a\nparametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where\neach operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we\nintroduce two new architectures, $\\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\\mathrm{MONet}$, and\nestablish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,\nintegrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit\nscaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target\napproximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a\nframework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show\nhow approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical\nexperiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power\nand efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a\nunified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator\nlearning across multiple operators."}

Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the\nNDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each\nlayer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters\ndirectly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The\narchitecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer\nimplementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired\nby normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the\nmanifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that\noptimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a\ndual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive\ncurvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that\nenhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient\ndescent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers\nunprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear\ngeometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,\nincluding its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual\nlearning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative\nmodeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural\nDifferential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically\nstructured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems."}
