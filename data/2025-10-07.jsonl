We first restructure the forward\nshallow water equations to obtain an inverse model in which the bottom profile\nis the only unknown, and then discretize this model using a second-order\nfinite-difference scheme to infer the floor topography. We demonstrate that the\napproach satisfies a Lipschitz stability and is independent of the initial\nconditions of the forward problem. The well-posedness of this inverse model\nrequires that, at the chosen measurement time $t^{\\star}$, the discharge be\nstrictly positive across the fixed portion of the open channel, which is\nautomatically satisfied for steady and supercritical flows. For unsteady\nsubcritical and transcritical flows, we derive two empirically validated\nsufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity after a sufficiently large\ntime. The proposed methodology is tested on a range of scenarios, including\nclassical benchmarks and different types of inlet discharges and bathymetries.\nWe find that this analytic approach yields high approximation accuracy and that\nthe bed profile reconstruction is stable under noise. In addition, the\nsufficient conditions are met across all tests."}

In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical\nexperiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach\neffectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks without compromising learning performance."}

Designing such\nmissions requires rapid exploration of the tradespace between control cost and\nflight time across multiple candidate targets. However, multi-objective\noptimization in this setting is challenging, as the underlying constraints are\noften highly nonconvex, and mission designers must balance accuracy (e.g.,\nsolving the full problem) with efficiency (e.g., convex relaxations), slowing\niteration and limiting design agility. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AI-powered framework that enables agile mission design for a wide\nrange of Earth orbit rendezvous scenarios. Given the orbital information of the\ntarget spacecraft, boundary conditions, and a range of flight times, this work\nproposes a Transformer-based architecture that generates, in a single\nparallelized inference step, a set of near-Pareto optimal trajectories across\nvarying flight times, thereby enabling rapid mission trade studies. The model\nis further extended to accommodate variable flight times and perturbed orbital\ndynamics, supporting realistic multi-objective trade-offs. Validation on\nchance-constrained rendezvous problems with passive safety constraints\ndemonstrates that the model generalizes across both flight times and dynamics,\nconsistently providing high-quality initial guesses that converge to superior\nsolutions in fewer iterations. Moreover, the framework efficiently approximates\nthe Pareto front, achieving runtimes comparable to convex relaxation by\nexploiting parallelized inference. Together, these results position the\nproposed framework as a practical surrogate for nonconvex trajectory generation\nand mark an important step toward AI-driven trajectory design for accelerating\npreliminary mission planning in real-world rendezvous applications."}

In this approach, the preconditioned\nJacobian is reused across multiple inner iterations, while a prescribed maximum\nnumber of inner iterations together with an adaptive early-stopping criterion\ndetermines whether the current preconditioner can be retained in subsequent\nouter iterations. These mechanisms effectively avoid redundant computations and\nenhance robustness. Extensive numerical experiments on both three-dimensional\nsteady-state and two-dimensional time-dependent PDEs with complex geometries\nconfirm the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed solvers. Compared with\nclassical discretization techniques and recent machine-learning-based\napproaches, the methods consistently deliver substantial accuracy improvements\nand robust convergence, thereby establishing the RFM combined with IPN/AMIPN as\nan efficient framework for large-scale nonlinear PDEs. ."}

Such delays render event\noccurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring.\nThis issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly\nenrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our\nstudy addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard\nfunctions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability\ndistribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We\nconstruct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its\nasymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization\nalgorithm to compute its estimates. Using these findings, we propose a\ntwo-stage estimation procedure based on a parametric proportional hazards model\nto evaluate observations subject to administrative censoring. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method effectively improves the timeliness of risk\nevaluation for newly enrolled cohorts."}

The algorithm is evaluated on two\ntime-dependent nonlinear model problems: (i) coupled fluid flow and heat\ntransfer in porous media and (ii) thermo-poromechanics in porous media with\nfractures, governed by frictional contact mechanics. These experiments\ndemonstrate that the algorithm selects efficient and robust solvers with\nnegligible overhead and performs comparably to a reference selection policy\nthat has full access to the performance data of prior simulations. Our results\nindicate that the proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of\nsolver selection and tuning, providing particular value to simulation engineers\nand researchers, especially when expert knowledge on linear solver tuning is\nnot readily available."}

In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the\nconnection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the\nperimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in\n1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the\nperimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame\nin ${\\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning\nthe discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons.\nBuilding upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$\nvectors in ${\\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \\geq 3$ has an odd\nfactor.

By leveraging\nthe inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the\ncompression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a\nrigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of\n$\\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming\nalgorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal\ncompression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time\ncomplexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal\nfoundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new\ndirections for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures."}

A full-order $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ observer is synthesized\nwith explicit $\\mathcal{L}_2$ performance bounds. The formulation yields a\nnonlinear estimator that operates directly on the governing equations and\navoids reliance on local linearizations. Dominant nonlinearities are expressed\nas structured real uncertainties, while measurement fidelity is represented\nthrough range-dependent weighting with Earth-Moon distances reconstructed from\nline-of-sight geometry. The sensing architecture assumes passive\nstar-tracker-class optical instruments, eliminating the need for time-of-flight\nranging or precision clocks. Simulations demonstrate bounded estimation errors\nand smooth position tracking over multiple orbital periods, with the largest\ndeviations observed in the out-of-plane states, consistent with the stiffness\nof the vertical dynamics and the limitations of angle-only observability.\nApplication to a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) illustrates that the\nframework can achieve robust onboard navigation with bounded estimation errors\nwith flight-representative sensors."}
