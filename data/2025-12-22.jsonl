This failure mode is quite common in numerical simulations of fluids and plasmas. Lawson proposed Generalized Runge-Kutta Processes for stiff problems in 1967, in which the stiff linear operator is treated fully implicitly via matrix exponentiation. Any Runge-Kutta scheme induces valid Lawson integration, but a scheme is exceptionally simple to implement if the abscissa $c_i$ are ordered and equally spaced. Classical RK4 satisfies this requirement, but it is difficult to derive efficient higher order schemes with this constraint. Here I present an explicit sixth order method identified with Newton-Raphson iteration that provides simple Lawson integration."}

The framework is built on Sakuma-Weeks triangulations and introduces a family of Farey recursive polynomials.\n  For a rational number which determines a hyperbolic 2-bridge link, this paper provides a simple recursive algorithm to determine a Farey recursive polynomial which has a root which determines the geometry of the link complement. This root is the shape parameter for a pair of tetrahedra in the Sakuma-Weeks triangulation. Using the same polynomials, the paper defines rational functions, one function for each edge in the Farey graph. Evaluating these rational functions at the root yields the complete collection of shape parameters for the triangulation.\n  The Riley slice and its exterior lie in the complex plane and are traditionally viewed as parameter spaces for two-parabolic generated subgroups of PSL(2,C). This paper's triangulation-based approach provides a more geometric perspective to these parameter spaces. The Farey recursive methods apply throughout the Riley slice and its exterior, enabling computations for quotient orbifolds of Kleinian groups generated by parabolic pairs, incomplete hyperbolic spaces with non-discrete parameter groups, and others.

Since there are no increasing functions from $ω_1$ to $\\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.\n  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.\n  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above.

These trapped modes are associated to eigenvalues of the Maxwell's operator, that can be either below the essential spectrum or embedded in it. First for homogeneous waveguides, we present different families of geometries for which we can prove the existence of eigenvalues. Then we exhibit certain non homogeneous waveguides with local perturbations of the dielectric constants that support trapped modes.

Agents are characterized by their position, the angle determining their direction of motion, and their angular velocity. The dynamics combine features of the well-known Vicsek and Kuramoto models, which describe collective dynamics and synchronization, respectively. The evolution of the directions of motion follows a Vicsek model, where agents align their orientations with the mean orientation of their neighbors, subject to some noise. Similarly, the angular velocities relax towards the average angular velocity of the neighboring agents, also subject to noise. From the IBM we derive the corresponding kinetic equation in the limit of a large number of agents and formally obtain the macroscopic equations through a macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limit. Numerical simulations of the IBM reveal a variety of patterns, including rotating clusters, traveling orientation waves, and globally synchronized rotational motion. A qualitative comparison with simulations of the macroscopic system show the ability of the macroscopic model to reproduce some emergent behavior of the IBM."}

In this work, we consider methods based on time-shifting, where the timeline of one data stream is randomly shifted relative to another, to mimic the types of coincidences that could occur by random chance. Our theoretical results establish rigorous finite-sample guarantees controlling the probability of false positives, under weak assumptions that allow for dependence within the time series data, providing reassurance that time-shifting methods are a reliable tool for inference in this setting.

The Biot system couples elastic deformation of a porous solid with viscous fluid flow and commonly arises on domains with complex geometries that make high-quality volumetric meshing challenging. To address this issue, we employ the cut finite element framework, where the domain boundary is represented independently of the background mesh, which significantly simplifies the meshing process. Our approach builds upon a parameter robust total pressure formulation of the Biot system, which we combine with the cut finite element method to develop a geometrically robust solution scheme, while preserving the parameter robustness. A key ingredient in the theoretical analysis is a modified inf-sup condition which also holds for mixed boundary conditions, leading to stability and optimal error estimates for the proposed formulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence demonstrating the theoretical properties of the method and showcasing its capabilities by solving the Biot system on a realistic brain geometry."}

First, two criteria are established for characterizing polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices, generalizing existing results, and then an additional criterion is derived in terms of the right roots of the associated Wedderburn polynomial. Using these criteria, methods are developed to construct skew polynomials that give rise to quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings. This framework extends known constructions to the non-commutative setting and significantly enlarges the family of available matrices, with potential applications to efficient diffusion layers in cryptographic primitives.

We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\\mathrm{H}\\subset \\mathrm{U}$."}

We evaluated the widely used Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm and the newer Maximum a Posteriori approach with Entropy prior (MAP-Ent) approach in the context of quantifying radiopharmaceutical uptake in pathological lesions. Numerical experiments were performed using a digital twin of the standardized NEMA IEC phantom, which contains six spheres of varying diameters to simulate lesions. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using the maximum recovery coefficient (RCmax), defined as the ratio of the reconstructed maximum activity to the true value. The study shows that OSEM exhibits unstable convergence during iterations, leading to noise and edge artifacts in lesion images. Post-filtering stabilizes the reconstruction and ensures convergence, producing RCmax-size curves that could be used as correction factors in clinical evaluations. However, this approach significantly underestimates uptake in small lesions and may even lead to the complete loss of small lesions on reconstructed images. In contrast, MAP-Ent demonstrates fundamentally different behavior: it achieves stable convergence and preserves quantitative accuracy without post-filtering, while maintaining the contrast of even the smallest lesions. However, the iteration number at which accurate reconstruction is achieved depends strongly on the choice of a single global regularization parameter, which limits optimal performance across lesions of different sizes. These results demonstrate the need for locally adaptive regularization in MAP-Ent to improve quantitative accuracy in lesion reconstruction."}

A partition dynamics is designed to enable the asymptotical consensus of multi-agent reference points, as well as the workload-balanced subdivision of coverage region. On this basis, a distributed coverage control algorithm is developed to drive each agent toward the optimal deployment of their respective subregions, thereby minimizing the coverage cost.

In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights.

To address this challenge, we introduce a formal asymptotic scheme that expands the density function around an equilibrium distribution, thereby reducing the high computational cost associated with the fully coupled microscopic processes while still maintaining the dynamic microscopic feedback in explicit expressions. The proposed asymptotic expansion is based on a detailed physical scaling law which characterizes the multiscale balance at the fast relaxation limit of the microscopic state. An asymptotic closure model for the macroscopic fluid equation is then derived according to the explicit asymptotic density expansion. Furthermore, the resulting closure model preserves the energy-dissipation law inherited from the original fully coupled multiscale system. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the asymptotic density formula and the corresponding flow velocity equations in several micro-macro models. This new asymptotic strategy offers a promising approach for efficient computations of a wide range of multiscale complex fluids."}

We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude. Numerical experiments on stiff, oscillatory, and bottleneck reaction networks show that the method maintains accuracy while using substantially smaller state spaces."}

In this approach, the physical domain is represented independently from the computational mesh, allowing the latter to be generated more easily compared with body-fitted meshes. While this facilitates the treatment of complex geometries, it also introduces challenges, such as ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix caused by small cut elements and difficulties in accurately enforcing boundary conditions. A recently proposed technique to address these issues is the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM), which represents the computational domain solely through uncut elements and enforces boundary conditions via a Taylor expansion from a surrogate boundary to the true boundary. Previous studies have shown that, for Neumann boundary conditions, the flux evaluation requires additional derivatives in the Taylor expansion, effectively reducing the order of convergence by one. In this work, we investigate for the first time the performance of SBM combined with Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) under various local refinement strategies. In particular, we propose local p- and k-refinement schemes for THB-splines and compare them with local h-refinement and the unmodified SBM. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced shift operator that incorporates mixed partial derivatives, in contrast to the standard operator. The study assesses accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for benchmark problems on trimmed domains. The results highlight how different refinement strategies affect convergence behavior in trimmed IGA formulations using SBM and demonstrate that targeted degree elevation can mitigate the Neumann boundary limitations of the standard method."}

Usually, coorbit spaces are defined by collecting all distributions for which the voice transform associated with a square-integrable group representation possesses a certain decay, usually measured in a Banach space norm such as weighted $L_p$-norms. Unfortunately, in cases where the representation does not satisfy certain integrability conditions, one is faced with a bottleneck, namely that the discretization of the coorbit spaces is surprisingly difficult.

This conjecture is a tremendous strengthening of the Four-Colour Theorem and is regarded as one of the most important open problems in graph theory. The case of Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs with $α(G) = 2$ has garnered much attention. Seymour writes: ``My own belief is, if Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for graphs with stability number two then it is probably true in general, so it would be very nice to decide this case.''\n  This paper presents several tools useful for proving that a graph $G$ with $α(G) = 2$ satisfies Hadwiger's Conjecture. In doing so, we survey and generalise several classical results on the $α(G) = 2$ case of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Further, we apply these tools to prove variants of Hadwiger's Conjecture for several noteworthy classes of graphs with $α(G) = 2$. In particular, we prove Hadwiger's Conjecture for inflations of the complements of the following graphs: graphs with girth at least $5$, triangle-free Kneser graphs, and the Clebsch, Mesner, and Gewirtz graphs. This paper also highlights classes of graphs with $α(G) = 2$ where it is unknown if Hadwiger's Conjecture holds."}

Classical optimal procedures often rely on strong structural assumptions, which can be misspecified in practice and complicate deployment. This limitation has sparked growing interest in structure-agnostic approaches -- methods that debias black-box nuisance estimates without imposing structural priors. Understanding the fundamental limits of these methods is therefore crucial. This paper provides a systematic investigation of the optimal error rates achievable by structure-agnostic estimators. We first show that, for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), a central parameter in causal inference, doubly robust learning attains optimal structure-agnostic error rates. We then extend our analysis to a general class of functionals that depend on unknown nuisance functions and establish the structure-agnostic optimality of debiased/double machine learning (DML). We distinguish two regimes -- one where double robustness is attainable and one where it is not -- leading to different optimal rates for first-order debiasing, and show that DML is optimal in both regimes. Finally, we instantiate our general lower bounds by deriving explicit optimal rates that recover existing results and extend to additional estimands of interest. Our results provide theoretical validation for widely used first-order debiasing methods and guidance for practitioners seeking optimal approaches in the absence of structural assumptions. This paper generalizes and subsumes the ATE lower bound established in \\citet{jin2024structure} by the same authors."}

We show that in the no-slip limit three fundamentally different classes of limiting solutions are approached, each of them corresponding to a different scaling of the microscopic contact angle as the regularization parameter vanishes. These findings suggest that the thin-film equation with no slip supports a rich family of physically admissible solutions, provided one interprets the no-slip thin film equation as the asymptotic limit of models which regularized slip conditions.

Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

A main result is that we characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria that do not result in immediate absorption, but instead are attained with both players extracting resources according to a state-dependent rate of threshold type, corresponding to the presence of control only when the state process is in an interval $(b,\\infty)$. The underlying assumption is, roughly, that the drift coefficient of the uncontrolled state process grows sufficiently fast in relation to the discount rate, implying that the value for the corresponding one-player problem is infinite. We also study a generalization of the game that allows a state-dependent profit rate integrated against the control processes. In this game we again characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria of threshold type. In particular, a main novelty is that we find equilibria where the state process is controlled with its own local time such that we have reflection points with associated initial jumps, as well as other points in the state space where the control processes increase in a singular manner (skew points)."}

By neglecting truncation error from basis expansion, two main sources of errors propagate to the final sensitivity indices: the metamodeling related error and the sampling-based, or pick-freeze (PF), estimation error. This work provides an efficient algorithm to estimate these errors in the frame of Gaussian processes (GP), based on the approach of Le Gratiet et al. [16]. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the number of basis coefficients of expanded model outputs is significantly smaller than output dimensions. Basis coefficients are fitted by GP models and multiple conditional GP trajectories are sampled. Then, vector-valued PF estimation is used to speed-up the estimation of Sobol indices and generalized sensitivity indices (GSI). We illustrate the methodology on an analytical test case and on an application in non-Newtonian hydraulics, modelling an idealized dam-break flow. Numerical tests show an improvement of 15 times in the computational time when compared to the application of Le Gratiet et al. [16] algorithm separately over each output dimension."}

Despite a constant density, the model allows for non-isochoric deformation and the propagation of pressure waves. An additive decomposition of the strain rate into elastic and inelastic parts leads to an evolution equation for the small elastic strain, which is coupled with an adapted momentum equation. As plasticity is modeled through a non-smooth dissipation potential, we introduce a weak formulation in terms of a variational inequality. Since the well-posedness in such a weak setting is out of reach, we study two possible modifications: the regularization in terms of stress diffusion, and the relaxation of the solvability concept by transition to energy-variational solutions.

If being extremal means maximimizing a real valued quantity and we are sure to approach the supremum fast enough, after a countable number of steps and a limiting procedure we are done.\n  In this short note we want to advertise a slightly different line of thought, where rather than trying to approach the supremum fast enough, we: try to increase, if possible, the function to be maximized and, at the same time, index our recursive procedure over ordinals. Since there are no increasing functions from $ω_1$ to $\\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.\n  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.\n  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above.

This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications."}

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

The primary motivation is to surpass the physical limitations imposed by the quasi-static approximation for SPRs through anisotropic geometric design. The analysis boils down to analyzing the spectral properties of the matrix-valued elastic Neumann-Poincaré (NP) operator defined on the nanorod boundary. We develop novel analytical techniques and conduct a rigorous asymptotic analysis of elastic layer potential operators, specifically adapted for highly anisotropic structures. Within this framework, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the scattered field in the quasi-static regime. A thorough examination of these expressions yields explicit resonance conditions that intricately link three fundamental parameters: elastic material parameters, wave frequency, and nanorod geometry. Furthermore, we characterize the intrinsic relationship between these parameters and the associated energy blow-up rate of the resonant field. This analysis explicitly establishes a sharp curvature concentration effect at the nanorod extremities, where field enhancement is locally maximized. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for harnessing elastic SPRs through anisotropic geometric engineering, with implications for sensing, wave focusing, and metamaterial applications."}

The method is based on choosing a new state on a slice, i.e., a superlevel set of the given unnormalized target density (with respect to a reference measure). However, slice sampling algorithms usually require per step multiple evaluations of the target density, and thus can become computationally expensive. This is particularly the case for Bayesian inference with costly likelihoods. In this paper, we exploit deterministic approximations of the target density, which are relatively cheap to evaluate, and propose delayed acceptance versions of hybrid slice samplers.

Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems."}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators."}

We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests."}

We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity.

The algorithm has been revised for clarity, and feedback is welcome before final submission to a suitable journal", "summary": "The score set of a tournament is defined as the set of its distinct out-degrees. In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection."}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators."}

Our global-in-time results use Wigner transforms and a Lagrange multiplier viewpoint of the matrix-valued Wigner equation. In particular, we pass to the limit in the ''full\" Wigner matrix equation without projecting on the eigenspaces of the matrix-valued symbol of the Dirac operator. In the limit, the Lagrange multiplier maintains the constraint that the Wigner measure and the symbol of the Dirac operator commute and vanishes when projected on the electron or positron eigenspace.

Unlike the classical Stäckel setting, we allow the associated self-adjoint $(1,1)$-tensors $K_α$ to be non-diagonalisable and have Jordan blocks and points where the Segre characteristic changes. Our construction is covariant and is based on Nijenhuis geometry: starting from a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator $L$ and its symmetry algebra, we obtain a large class of such integrable systems in a coordinate-free and signature-independent way; it is explicit once we have chosen a gl-regular Nijnhuis operator. In the diagonalisable case, our construction reproduces the Stäckel construction, and in dimension $n=2$ it recovers all known systems of this type; for $n\\ge 3$ most of our systems are new. Finally, we establish applications to infinite-dimensional integrable systems of hydrodynamic type: namely, we show that for Killing $(1,1)$-tensors $ K_α$ corresponding to our example the evolutionarly PDE system of hydrodynamic type $u_t = K_α(u)u_x$ is integrable. We describe its symmetries, and use generalised reciprocal transformations to reduce it to a system with constant coefficient matrices."}

Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow.

The inequality also holds in the context of last passage percolation (LPP), which is the zero temperature limit of polymer models and an important subclass in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Recently, an analog of the BK inequality was discovered in the context of zero temperature line ensembles and the scaling limit of LPP, where it was used to study upper tail probabilities of the weight and the scaling limit of geodesics under such upper tail conditionings. However, while it has become apparent that such an inequality in the positive temperature setting would have a number of applications, it seems likely that a direct generalization of the zero temperature inequality would not hold. In this work we prove a version of the BK inequality for the KPZ line ensemble and the continuum directed random polymer. We do so by working with the log gamma polymer, making use of its integrability and the geometric RSK correspondence. Our inequality serves as a key input in analyzing the KPZ line ensemble and proving sharp upper tail estimates of the KPZ equation in arXiv:2208.08922, and proving convergence of the continuum directed random polymer to Brownian bridge under the upper tail event in arXiv:2311.12009.

Our global-in-time results use Wigner transforms and a Lagrange multiplier viewpoint of the matrix-valued Wigner equation. In particular, we pass to the limit in the ''full\" Wigner matrix equation without projecting on the eigenspaces of the matrix-valued symbol of the Dirac operator. In the limit, the Lagrange multiplier maintains the constraint that the Wigner measure and the symbol of the Dirac operator commute and vanishes when projected on the electron or positron eigenspace. This is a different approach to the problem as discussed in [P. Gérard, P. Markowich, N.J. Mauser, F. Poupaud: Comm. Pure Appl.

In particular, we consider a 1-D model of a biofilm with susceptible, persistor and resistant bacteria. Resistance can be transferred to the susceptible bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically via conjugation. We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust."}

We analyze the LLB system on bounded domains in one, two, and three dimensions, establishing the existence of optimal controls that drive the magnetization to a desired target state within a minimal time frame. Utilizing a Lagrange multiplier approach and an adjoint-based framework, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Furthermore, we establish second-order sufficient conditions for local optimality, addressing the mathematical challenges posed by the system's inherent nonlinearities and the nonlinear appearance of the control in the effective magnetic field. These results provide a rigorous theoretical basis for the rapid manipulation of magnetic states, offering insights into the fundamental limits of control for nonlinear diffusion-relaxation processes in magnetism. Such findings are essential for advancing high-speed magnetic memory technologies and optimizing thermal magnetic switching in next-generation storage technologies."}
