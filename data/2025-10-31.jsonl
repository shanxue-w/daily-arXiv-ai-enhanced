The method advances\nhigh-resolution schemes by combining the efficiency of linear reconstruction\nwith the robustness of nonlinear formulations, activated only when needed\nthrough a novel a priori detection strategy. This minimizes the use of costly\nCompact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENOZ) or Monotonic\nUpstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstructions,\nreducing computational cost without compromising accuracy or stability. The\nframework merges CWENOZ and the Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection\n(MOOD) paradigm while introducing a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector\n(NAD) that classifies the local flow into smooth, weakly non-smooth, and\ndiscontinuous regions in a single step. Each region is then reconstructed using\nan optimal method: a high-order linear scheme in smooth areas, CWENOZ in weakly\nnon-smooth zones, and a second-order MUSCL near discontinuities. This targeted\na priori allocation preserves high-order accuracy where possible and ensures\nstable, non-oscillatory behavior near shocks and steep gradients. Implemented\nwithin the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the framework\nsupports arbitrary-order reconstructions on mixed-element meshes. Extensive\ntwo- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm that it retains the designed\naccuracy in smooth regions while greatly improving robustness in\nshock-dominated flows. Thanks to the reduced frequency of nonlinear\nreconstructions, the method achieves up to 2.5x speed-up over a CWENOZ scheme\nof equal order in 3D compressible turbulence. This hybrid approach thus brings\nhigh-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD through its balance of\nefficiency, robustness, and reliability."}

The previously developed one-dimensional f-EFG solver offers\na limited demonstration of the true efficacy of EFG formulations for FDEs, as\nit is restricted to simple 1D line geometries.

The proposed solver can handle complex and\nirregular 2D domains that are challenging for mesh-based methods. As an\nexample, the developed framework is employed to investigate nonlocal elasticity\ngoverned by fractional-order constitutive relations in a square and circular\nplate. Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates key drawbacks of FEM,\nincluding high computational cost, mesh generation, and reduced accuracy in\nirregular domains. The 2D f-EFG employs 2D Moving Least Squares (MLS)\napproximants, which are particularly effective in approximating fractional\nderivatives from nodal values. The 2D f-EFG solver is employed here for the\nnumerical solution of fractional-order linear and nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations corresponding to the nonlocal elastic response of a\nplate.

For visual content, this paradigm\nshifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic\nstructure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches\ngenerally follow one of two paths: transmitting only text descriptions, which\noften fail to capture precise spatial layouts and fine-grained appearance\ndetails; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which\ntends to introduce substantial semantic redundancy. A key challenge, therefore,\nis to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and\nvisual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper\nintroduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive\nretransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a\nlimited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based\ninpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency\nmechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image\nand the original text description. When a semantic discrepancy is detected, the\nreceiver triggers a retransmission to request a small set of additional latent\nblocks and refine the image reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces\nbandwidth usage while preserving high semantic accuracy, achieving an efficient\nbalance between reconstruction quality and transmission overhead."}

Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We\nprove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a\nsingle-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the\nglobal optimum in polynomial time.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates.

To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\".

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density\nRatio Estimation and Riesz Regression."}

However, challenges\nremain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads\nto high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that\nscale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant\ninference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nMixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a\nsparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while\ncontrolling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise\nrouter-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert\nnetworks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific\nfeatures. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture\ncommon properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final\noutput is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated\nexperts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE\ndatasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%\nreduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated\nparameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that\ndataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which\nvalidates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture."}

Our proposal\nrelies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go\ntheorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete\npaths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected\nstates (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with\ntime-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum\ncritical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e.\n$\\delta N_w=2$ where $\\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the\ntQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via\napplying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of\ngapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where\ntQCPs, with $\\delta N_w \\geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry\nbreaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single\nWeyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class\ntopological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a\n$T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an\nequivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the\nconserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a\n$T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators\ntypically span a two-dimensional linear space instead.

This is achieved by recalling that the\n$\\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop\n$\\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on\ntwistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The\none-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly."}
