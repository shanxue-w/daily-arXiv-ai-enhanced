Ulam introduced lucky numbers as a sieve-based analogue of prime numbers. We derive an exact formula for the $n$th lucky number, providing a new tool for quantitative analysis. We formulate and prove a version of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for lucky numbers. This theorem provides an entirely new viewpoint on number theory. Building on the fundamental theorem, we introduce foundational definitions and analogues of arithmetical functions. Additionally, we prove an analogue of Bertrand's postulate for lucky numbers. Finally, we use the formula for the $n$th lucky number to prove a new result on the order of magnitude of the gaps between consecutive lucky numbers. We obtain an asymptotic bound that is much stronger than the best known bound for primes, and therefore obtain the first result that is known for lucky numbers but still conjectured to be true for primes. Together, these results establish a foundation for the arithmetic theory of lucky numbers and contribute to a broader understanding of sieve-generated sequences."}

Traditionally, PRs have been elicited using real numbers. However, in real-world decision-makers usually feel more comfortable using linguistic expressions closer to natural language. In this context, our purpose is to extend the classical idea of PR into the environment of Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers (TrFNs) by addressing several drawbacks in current research. Existing fuzzy extensions for Fuzzy Preference Relations (FPRs) and Multiplicative Preference Relations (MPRs) assume that the notion of neutrality must be modeled by a crisp real number, which fails to capture the subjective and diverse ways in which decision-makers may perceive indifference. Moreover, current research lacks a theoretical framework that unifies both FPRs and MPRs for fuzzy numbers and simultaneously generalizes the involved classical notions (e.g., reciprocity, consistency) from the perspective of fuzzy arithmetic. Therefore, we introduce the notion of neutral TrFN, a fuzzy number that can model indifference on a certain fuzzy scale. This provides a flexible representation of neutrality, leading to a more realistic extension of PRs into the fuzzy environment. Building upon this, we propose the Trapezoidal FPR (TrFPR), analyze its properties and how reciprocity and consistency are extended using fuzzy arithmetic. Furthermore, we introduce the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) utility vector associated with a consistent TrFPR and develop an optimization model to derive it from an inconsistent TrFPR to compute priority values. These ideas are also extended to MPRs in the fuzzy domain. Finally, the applicability of the proposed LAD utility method is demonstrated in evaluating land development projects, where comparison with fuzzy AHP illustrates its superiority."}

The model captures clogging/declogging from biomass, changes in interfacial tension due to biosurfactant, and the resulting impact on relative permeability, capillary pressure, and residual oil saturation via a trapping-number framework. The flow model is validated (Buckley-Leverett and coreflood benchmarks); transport (microbes/nutrients/surfactant) is validated against Hendry et al. 1997 breakthrough data. Finally, the model accurately predicts a Berea-core MEOR case study using field microbes and brine, matching recovery histories with small RMS error.

Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + λv = 0 $ into solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schrödinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a function $f$ are established, together with a method for its construction.\n  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel.

We prove that these $h$-semigroups are equivalent to classical evolution semigroups through a natural transformation.

Such adaptation requires code conversion, wherein data encoded under an initial $[k^I + r^I, k^I]$ code is transformed into data encoded under a final $[k^F + r^F, k^F]$ code - an operation that can be resource-intensive. Convertible codes are a class of codes designed to facilitate this transformation efficiently while preserving desirable properties such as the MDS property. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits on the bandwidth cost of conversion (total amount of data transferred between the storage nodes during conversion) for systematic MDS convertible codes. Specifically, we study the subclass of conversions known as the split regime (a single initial codeword is converted into multiple final codewords).\n  In this setting, prior to this work, the best known lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion for all parameters were derived by Maturana and Rashmi under certain uniformity assumptions on the number of symbols downloaded from each node. Further, these bounds were shown to be tight for the parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq r^F$. In this work, we derive lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of systematic MDS convertible codes for all parameters in the split regime without the uniformity assumption. Moreover, our bounds are tight for the broader parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq k^F$. Subsequently, our bounds also partially resolve the conjecture proposed by Maturana and Rashmi. We employ a novel information-theoretic framework, which assumes only that the initial and final codes are systematic and does not rely on any linearity assumptions or the aforementioned uniformity assumptions."}

A central result shows that for finite residuated lattices, being semi-simple is equivalent to being hyperarchimedean, highlighting the natural connection between these concepts. Complementary results deepening on the understanding of the relation between simple filters and maximal filters in residuated lattices are also established."}

In 1927 Littlewood proved a negative result, i.e., that a.e. convergence fails for certain approach regions: More precisely, it fails for the rotationally invariant families of tangential approach regions that end curvilinearly at the boundary. The fact that tangential approach regions which end sequentially at the boundary may instead be very well conducive to a.e. convergence was understood more recently by W. Rudin (in 1979) and A. Nagel and E.M. Stein (in 1984), in contributions that provided additional and much needed insight, and that prompted the question of giving an a priori description of those families of tangential approach regions which end sequentially at the boundary and for which a.e. convergence fails. Our main result is the first one of this kind. Indeed, we prove the failure of a.e. convergence for a class of approach regions, introduced in this work, which we call projectively adjacent, that contains curvilinear approach regions as well as sequential ones. Our result recaptures the aforementioned theorem of Littlewood as well as some of the other theorems of that type, but its novelty lies in the fact that, while all previous negative results for tangential approach (Littlewood, 1927; Lohwater and Piranian, 1957; Aikawa, 1990-1991, and others) dealt with approach regions that either are curves or share with curves a certain topological property that excludes the possibility that they could end sequentially at the boundary, our negative result deals with a class of approach regions that contains both the curvilinear and the sequential ones. Hence we present a significant extension of the class of those families of approach regions for which a.e. convergence fails."}

The proposed algorithm relies on prior knowledge about high-frequency components obtained from PDEs. It aims to use this prior knowledge to guide the neural network in rapidly approximating the solution's high-frequency components. The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure. For nonhomogeneous PDEs ($f(x)\\neq c, c\\in R$), we embed the source term as an additional feature into the neural network. The source term typically contains partial or complete frequency information of the target solution, particularly its high-frequency components. This provides prior knowledge about the high-frequency components of the target solution. For homogeneous PDEs, we embed the initial/boundary conditions with high-frequency components into the neural network. Based on spectral bias, we use a fully connected neural network as the low-frequency subnetwork to capture low-frequency components of the target solution. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the FG-PINNs, including the one-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$), the nonlinear wave equations (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$) and the two-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-3})$)."}

We address this issue by extending an existing formalization grounded in a dependent type theory using the Coq proof assistant, together with a Whitehead-like point-free interpretation of Tarski's geometry. More precisely, we build on a library called lambda-MM to formalize Tarski's geometry of solids by investigating an algebraic formulation of topological relations on top of the mereological framework. Since Tarski's work is rooted in Lesniewski's mereology, and given that lambda-MM currently provides only a partial implementation of Tarski's geometry, the first part of the paper completes this framework by proving that mereological classes correspond to regular open sets. This yields a topology of individual names that can be extended with Tarski's geometric primitives. Unlike classical approaches in qualitative logical theories, we adopt a solution that derives a full topological space from mereology together with a geometric subspace, thereby increasing the expressiveness of the theory. In the second part, we show that Tarski's geometry forms a subspace of this topology in which regions correspond to restricted classes. We also prove three of Tarski's original postulates, reducing his axiomatic system, and extend the theory with the T2 (Hausdorff) property and additional definitions."}

This result is an analogue of classical non-uniqueness phenomena in geometric tomography."}

The methods used are the Stein method combined with an extension of a combinatorial method of Bolthausen (1984). The conditions obtained for the validity of these Edgeworth expansions are very similar to the necessary and sufficient conditions found by Bickel and Robinson (1982) for the case of sums of iid random variables. But these conditions are often difficult to prove directly. For simple linear rank statistics, however, it is possible to use a result from van Zwet (1982) to verify these assumptions. Thus, we obtain conditions for the validity of Edgeworth expansions, which on the one hand are very easy to prove and on the other hand are much more general than all previously known conditions.

This operator enables the construction of bipartite extensions that preserve all edges of the original joint graph and supports redundant multiresolution representations. Based on this operator, we design two-channel joint time-vertex oversampled graph filter banks and develop efficient oversampling extensions using a $K$-coloring strategy.

However, this transition is hindered by fundamental limitations in conventional metasurface transmitter architectures, including restricted modulation orders, symbol-level spatial inconsistency, and significant harmonic interference. These issues stem from the intrinsic coupling between baseband signal processing and radio-frequency beamforming in monolithic designs reliant on simplistic switching mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA) that fundamentally decouples these functionalities. The MSA introduces a dual-stage up-conversion process, comprising a digital up-conversion module for in-phase/quadrature modulation and baseband-to-intermediate frequency conversion, a precoder module for precoding, and a custom-designed magnitude-phase-decoupled metasurface that acts as a reconfigurable reflective mixer array. This decoupling of harmonic-free waveform generation from spatial precoding overcomes the critical drawbacks of existing approaches. Experimental results from a 5.8 GHz proof-of-concept prototype system validate the MSA's superior performance. The system generates spatially isotropic constellations for arbitrary-order QAM modulations, ensures consistent time-frequency signatures for applications like Doppler-spoofing, and achieves data rates up to 20 Mbps within a linear operating region that minimizes nonlinear distortion. The capability of employing spatial diversity and multi-stream interference cancellation has been demonstrated for the first time in a PM-based transmitter."}

Dao studied a similar notion of Tor-complexity. Recently, Dey-Ghosh-Saha initiated the study of Ext and Tor curvature of a pair of modules, which measure the exponential growth rates of the corresponding Ext and Tor, respectively. On the other hand, the concept of Burch ideals was introduced by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi, motivated by classical work of Burch.

Existing analyses have focused on local constant estimators and given samples, leaving the principles of transferring knowledge from auxiliary sources across heterogeneous time-varying domains insufficiently established. We derive uniform convergence for multivariate locally linear estimators under strong mixing. The resulting error expansion decomposes stochastic variation, smoothing bias, and a term induced by local stationarity. This additional term, originating from the locally stationary structure, has smaller order than in the Nadaraya-Watson benchmark, explaining the improved local linear performance. Building on these results, we propose bias-corrected transfer learned estimators that connect a sparsely observed series with densely observed related sources through a smoothly varying bias function defined over rescaled time and covariates.

The plant is assumed to be actuated through a Dirichlet boundary condition and subject to a Neumann condition on the unactuated side. The design is based on a finite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the original infinite-dimensional system, which is obtained via spectral decomposition. Convex stability and safety conditions are then derived for this truncated model by combining Lyapunov theory with local quadratic constraints (QC), which bound the nonlinear activation functions of the NN and guarantee robustness to model truncation, thus addressing the spillover problem. These conditions are integrated into the IL process to jointly minimize the imitation loss and maximize the volume of the certified region of attraction (ROA). The proposed framework is validated on an unstable reaction-diffusion PDE, demonstrating that the resulting NN controller efficiently reproduces the expert policy while ensuring formal stability guarantees."}

Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties.

This result means that a purely graphical concept of geodetical convexity in this graph is a cryptomorphic definition of a finite poset. In particular, the lattice of geodetically convex sets in this graph is graded and its height function is described in graphical terms. A counter-example, however, shows that the height function does not correspond to the usual graphical diameter, relating this matter to a combinatorial concept of the dimension of a poset.\n  Two alternative cryptomorphic views on a poset $P$ on $N$ are also briefly commented.

The usual representation of the index involves a multi-dimensional contour integral over the BPS spectrum of the free gauge theory. To find a closed form expression for the index, it is natural to attempt a residue evaluation. However, the presence of a non-isolated essential singularity inside the contour prevents a straightforward implementation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by gauge-fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Macdonald index, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. The simplified form manifests the strongly coupled BPS spectrum of the Macdonald sector of the theory, and suggests the absence of ``non-graviton'' operators in this sector. We also evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form."}

A standard approach for the analysis of the qualitative properties of the solutions of such an equation is to apply a logarithmic transformation, which yields a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with constraint. When the reproduction term is a concave function of the trait, it has been established that the solution is classical. We rigorously derive a first-order asymptotic expansion of the solution. This expansion allows us to approximate the moments of the phenotypic density. This result establishes a connection between the approximations of the phenotypic density obtained via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach and relevant biological quantities, which are more suitable from a modeling perspective."}

This paper, the second installment of the Categorical Spectral Architecture (CSA) program, develops a unified framework that integrates operator theory, spectral analysis, and categorical algebra. Building on the functorial and spectral foundations established in the first paper, we introduce the Synergy Operad, a syntactic framework that extends the multicategory of Hilbert spaces and bounded multilinear maps. The Canonical Representation Theorem provides a structure-preserving functor that aligns syntactic compositions with operator semantics. Another central component, the Coherence Theorem, ensures that grammatical equivalences correspond to identical semantic results.

The metric characterizing false alarms is the probability of a false alarm occurring before the horizon ends. The metric that characterizes the delay is \\emph{latency}, which is the smallest value such that the probability that detection delay exceeds this value is upper bounded to a predetermined latency level. The objective is to minimize the latency (at a given latency level), while maintaining a low false alarm probability. Under the pre-specified latency and false alarm levels, a universal lower bound on the latency, which any change detection procedure needs to satisfy, is derived. Change detectors are then developed, which are order-optimal in terms of the horizon. The case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known is considered first, and then the results are generalized to the non-parametric case when they are unknown except that they are sub-Gaussian with different means.

By examining the method through a collection of small coupling modes, we show that its behavior can be captured by a single scalar quantity for each mode. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations.

On extensive synthetic benchmarks, the interior-point method converges with roughly one third fewer iterations and about one half the computation time relative to INS, while attaining marginally higher accuracy and meeting all primary stopping conditions. By contrast, INS succeeds in fewer cases under default settings but benefits markedly from moderate regularization and step-length control; in tuned regimes its iteration count and runtime decrease substantially, narrowing yet not closing the gap. A sensitivity study indicates that interior-point performance remains stable across parameter changes, whereas INS is more affected by step length and regularization choice. Collectively, the evidence positions the interior-point method as a reliable baseline and INS as a configurable alternative when problem structure favors adaptive regularization."}

Recent work showed that a carefully chosen set of these descriptors encodes all of the geometric and topological information about a shape in R^d. In practice, epsilon nets are often used to find samples in one of two extremes. On one hand, making strong geometric assumptions about the shape allows us to choose epsilon small enough (corresponding to a high enough density sample) in order to guarantee a faithful representation, resulting in oversampling. On the other hand, if we choose a larger epsilon in order to allow faster computations, this leads to an incomplete description of the shape and a discretized transform that lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we investigate how many directions are really needed to represent geometric simplicial complexes, exploring both synthetic and real-world datasets. We provide constructive proofs that help establish size bounds and an experimental investigation giving insights into the consequences of over- and undersampling."}

To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems."}

Traditional projection or interpolation techniques often depend on mesh connectivity, explicit element mappings, or local reconstruction procedures, which can be computationally demanding and sensitive to mesh misalignment. Instead, we formulate the problem as a data-driven regression task that predicts function values at arbitrary target locations from scattered nodal data on the source mesh. By systematically exploring and comparing several neural network architectures, we identify a configuration that balances accuracy and efficiency and that performs reliably across a range of mesh resolutions and topologies. The resulting model enables fast and accurate evaluation without requiring access to mesh connectivity or element-wise information. Numerical experiments on adaptive meshes suggest that the framework is effective for field reconstruction and data transfer tasks. The code used in this paper is publicly available on GitHub."}

This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity.

In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane.

Within this framework, we consider the class of $\\ell_0$-Bregman relaxations, and establish sufficient conditions under which a critical point is isolated in terms of sparsity, in the sense that any other critical point has a strictly larger cardinality. In this way, we ensure a form of uniqueness in the solution structure. Furthermore, we analyze the exact recovery properties of such exact relaxations. To that end, we derive conditions under which the oracle solution (i.e., the one sharing the same support as the ground-truth) is the unique global minimizer of the relaxed problem, and is isolated in terms of sparsity.

Multiple scatterers are randomly distributed in the multi-layered medium with some scatterers possibly intersecting layer interfaces. The boundary integral formulation employs a layered-medium Green's function to enforce transmission conditions across interfaces, thus avoiding unknowns on the interfaces and significantly reducing the size of the discretized problem compared to approaches that use a free-space Green's function. To demonstrate the FMM speedup, a low-order Nyström method is used to discretize the boundary integral equation and then the resulting dense linear system is solved by GMRES iterative solver accelerated by an improved layered media FMM and a overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning. In the low frequency regime, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\\mathcal O(N)$ complexity. Numerical results validate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method under complex settings and various incident angles.

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments."}

They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models."}

Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp.

Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.\n  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium.

The case of module lattices (i.e., lattices which are also modules over a number ring) is of particular interest for cryptography and computational number theory. The hardness of finding short vectors in the asymptotic regime where the rank (as a module) is fixed is supporting the security of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards such as ML-DSA and ML-KEM.\n  In this article we prove the average-case hardness of this problem for uniformly random module lattices (with respect to the natural invariant measure on the space of module lattices of any fixed rank). More specifically, we prove a polynomial-time worst-case to average-case self-reduction for the approximate Shortest Independent Vector Problem ($γ$-SIVP) where the average case is the (discretized) uniform distribution over module lattices, with a polynomially-bounded loss in the approximation factor, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis.\n  This result was previously known only in the rank-1 case (so-called ideal lattices). That proof critically relied on the fact that the space of ideal lattices is a compact group. In higher rank, the space is neither compact nor a group.

The framework integrates a high-rate safety projection filter, a spacing-regulation layer based on a lag-aware proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and a slow-timescale economic optimizer balancing fuel consumption and travel time. The safety layer guarantees collision avoidance under bounded actuation delays by enforcing forward invariance of a velocity-aware headway constraint through a high-order control barrier function. The regulation layer shapes the spacing-error dynamics into a second-order form with interpretable parameters for damping and natural frequency while explicitly accounting for actuator lag. At the macroscopic level, fuel use is modeled by a tractive-power relation that captures aerodynamic benefits of close spacing, enabling a long-term optimization of speed trajectories subject to comfort and energy trade-offs. We show that the closed-loop dynamics converge to the Optimal Velocity Model with Relative Velocity (OVRV) under undisturbed conditions and derive worst-case upper bounds for platoon stabilization time. Numerical case studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over an canonical baseline controllers in both transient behavior and long-term energy efficiency."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability.

This paper confirms the conjecture by analyzing the error term $E_n(x) = \\log(p_1 \\cdots p_n) - k(n,x) \\log p_{n+1}$. Also, we derive the asymptotic expansion to $E_n(x)$ demonstrating that it is positive for all sufficiently large $n$ when $x > -2$. For each $x > -2$, we identify a minimal integer $Ψ(x)$ such that $E_n(x) > 0$ for all $n \\geq Ψ(x)$, precisely determining $Ψ(0.1) = 24,154,953$. Additionally, we establish effective upper bounds for $Ψ(x)$ both unconditionally and under the Riemann Hypothesis, with the conditional bounds showing a significant improvement. Our analysis fully resolves the conjecture and characterizes $Ψ(x)$ as a non-increasing, piecewise constant function, exhibiting discontinuities at a discrete set of threshold points. These results advance the understanding of Bonse-type inequalities and their asymptotic behavior."}

In our setting, each job is equipped with a Boolean formula (precedence constraint) over the set of jobs. A schedule satisfies a job's precedence constraint if setting earlier jobs to true satisfies the formula. Our definition generalizes several common types of precedence constraints: classical and-constraints if every formula is a conjunction, or-constraints if every formula is a disjunction, and and/or-constraints if every formula is in conjunctive normal form. We prove fixed-parameter tractability when parameterizing by the number of predecessors. For parameterization by the number of successors, however, the complexity depends on the structure of the precedence constraints. If every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction, we prove the problem to be fixed-parameter tractable. For constraints in disjunctive normal form, we prove W[1]-hardness. We show that the and/or-constrained problem is NP-hard, even for a single successor. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction. This result not only proves para-NP-hardness for parameterization by the number of machines but also complements the polynomial-time solvability on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction (Coffman and Graham 1972) or if every constraint is a disjunction (Berit 2005)."}

To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. We also introduce FedBacys-Odd, a more energy-efficient variant that allows clients to participate selectively, further reducing energy costs without compromising performance. We provide a convergence analysis for our framework and demonstrate its superior energy efficiency and robustness compared to existing algorithms through numerical experiments."}

Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(Λ, μ)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.\n  The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/Λ$ improve under convolution by $μ$.

Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile.

Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, where the performance of different (algebraic) coarse spaces is successfully distinguished. A key contribution of this work is the observation that, for certain high-contrast problems, simpler coarse spaces can be made competitive in terms of PCG convergence.

Inspired by Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE), we introduce an almost unbiased estimator, called ASSURE, for the expected utility of a proposed decision rule. ASSURE allows a user to choose a welfare-maximizing rule from a pre-specified class by optimizing the estimated welfare, thereby producing selection decisions that borrow strength across noisy estimates. We show that ASSURE produces decision rules that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal but infeasible decision rule in the pre-specified class. We apply ASSURE to the selection of Census tracts for economic opportunity, the identification of discriminating firms, and the analysis of $p$-value decision procedures in A/B testing."}

The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\\llλ$, where $λ$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/λ$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $λ$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\\ll λ$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables."}

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

Our goal is exact yet computationally efficient maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in regimes where many observations contain small counts, which imperils both identifiability and numerical stability. We develop three novel Kendall's tau-based approaches for initialization tailored to discrete margins in the low-count regime and embed it within an inference functions for margins (IFM) inspired start. We present three practical initializers (exact, low-intensity approximation, and a transformation-based approach) that substantially reduce the number of ML iterations and improve convergence. For the ML stage, we use an unconstrained reparameterization of the model's parameters using the log and spherical-Cholesky and compute exact rectangle probabilities. Analytical score functions are supplied throughout to stabilize Newton-type optimization. A simulation study across dimensions, dependence levels, and intensity regimes shows that the proposed initialization combined with exact ML achieves lower root-mean-squared error, lower bias and faster computation times than the alternative procedures. The methodology provides a pragmatic path to retain the statistical guarantees of ML (consistency, asymptotic normality, efficiency under correct specification) while remaining tractable for moderate- to high-dimensional discrete data.

The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\\llλ$, where $λ$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/λ$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $λ$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\\ll λ$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables."}

Concerning linear systems, our answers are negative: by developing a systematic approach, we demonstrate that approximate tracking controllability of the full state is impossible even in a certain weak sense, except for the trivial situation where the control space is isomorphic to the state space. Motivated by these negative findings for linear systems, we focus on nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we prove weak approximate tracking controllability on any time horizon for a general class of systems with arbitrary linear part and quadratic nonlinear terms. The considered weak notion of approximate tracking controllability involves the relaxation metric.

We show the existence of solutions of some stationary MFG systems with quite general coupling operators and nonnegative distributional source terms, on general bounded convex domains, under the primary assumptions of uniform ellipticity and the Cordes condition on the diffusion coefficient.

The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\\to \\infty$ and $ω\\to 0$ with their product $ρ= N ω^d$ fixed, where $ρ$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d>1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $ρ$ crosses a critical value $ρ_c(β)$, where $β$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_β(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_β(I,N) \\sim e^{-V Φ(I/V)}$ where $V = ω^{-d} \\gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $Φ(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \\leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $ρ< ρ_c(β)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d>1$.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."}

Our method applies to any nonnegative, locally integrable kernel, including singular and non-monotone ones. By reformulating the scheme as a stochastic Volterra equation with a measure-valued kernel, we establish weak convergence to the target Hawkes process in the Skorokhod $J_1$-topology.

This paper introduces DIGing-SGLD, a decentralized SGLD algorithm designed for scalable Bayesian learning in multi-agent systems operating over time-varying networks. Existing decentralized SGLD methods are restricted to static network topologies, and many exhibit steady-state sampling bias caused by network effects, even when full batches are used. DIGing-SGLD overcomes these limitations by integrating Langevin-based sampling with the gradient-tracking mechanism of the DIGing algorithm, originally developed for decentralized optimization over time-varying networks, thereby enabling efficient and bias-free sampling without a central coordinator. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-time non-asymptotic Wasserstein convergence guarantees for decentralized SGLD-based sampling over time-varying networks, with explicit constants. Under standard strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, DIGing-SGLD achieves geometric convergence to an $O(\\sqrtη)$ neighborhood of the target distribution, where $η$ is the stepsize, with dependence on the target accuracy matching the best-known rates for centralized and static-network SGLD algorithms using constant stepsize. Numerical experiments on Bayesian linear and logistic regression validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the strong empirical performance of DIGing-SGLD under dynamically evolving network conditions."}

While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature.

To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model.

Truck platooning can mitigate range anxiety through energy savings and, in turn, influence routing and charging decisions, yet most existing studies focus on a single highway corridor and do not capture network-wide operations. We study electric truck platooning on a general road network, where trucks must select routes and charging stations with heterogeneous prices and charging speeds, form platoons on shared arcs, and possibly take detours that trade off platoon savings with additional labor hours. We further allow in-platoon position swaps so that leading responsibility rotates, balancing battery usage and avoiding early depletion of any single truck. To jointly optimize routing paths, charging-station choices, labor time, and platoon formation and position swaps, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Because exact methods become intractable on realistic instances, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with a savings-based bounding scheme, infeasible-pair elimination, and candidate-station filtering. Computational experiments on test instances with up to 150 trucks show that incorporating platooning can reduce total operational costs by up to 2.77 percent, while the proposed algorithm cuts computation time by up to 99.96 percent compared with CPLEX and solves 150-truck instances in about 120 seconds, indicating strong potential for real-world applications."}

We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem.

By comparing simultaneous and individual estimation strategies, we demonstrate that the simultaneous approach offers a notable advantage in our system. To support this, we compute the quantum Fisher information matrices (QFIMs) based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD). Our results show that the quantum Cramér Rao bound (QCRB) associated with the RLD is consistently lower than that of the SLD, indicating superior estimation precision. From a physical standpoint, this improvement reflects the system's enhanced capacity to encode, transfer, and extract quantum information while allowing optimal control of fundamental interactions. We show that increasing the Rabi frequency, cavity loss rate, and the average number of photons and phonons, combined with reduced mechanical damping and temperature, enhances the system's sensitivity to the coupling parameters. These mechanisms act on the available quantum resources, such as entanglement, squeezing, and state purity, leading to more precise estimations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that under certain conditions, heterodyne detection can closely approach the ultimate precision set by the QFIM. This suggests that a measurement strategy based on heterodyne detection can offer an efficient and practical route for estimating the couplings $G_{mc}$ and $G_{mb}$, paving the way for high precision hybrid quantum sensors."}

While the convergence of this PDE-based thickness to the geometric thickness had been rigorously justified only for simple geometries such as intervals and straight bands, its validity for more general shapes remained open. In this work, we extend the analysis to annular domains, where curvature effects are nontrivial. We prove that the PDE-based thickness converges to the geometric thickness as the diffusion parameter tends to zero by estimating the difference between two notions of thickness with the square root of the diffusion parameter. Explicit expressions involving modified Bessel functions are obtained for annuli, together with sharp inequalities for their ratios. These results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the PDE-based thickness and demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool in shape analysis and topology optimization."}

Our approach builds upon the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNNs) methodology \\cite{APNN-transport}, which employs a micro-macro decomposition to handle the model's multiscale nature. We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $ρ$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $ρ$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $ρ_{\\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs. Validated on both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson systems, our work shows that the bi-fidelity formulation is a powerful enhancement for tackling multiscale kinetic equations, especially when dealing with inverse problems constrained by partial observation data."}

In this work, we present a novel framework for parameter inference in PDifMPs based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide detailed simulation algorithms for PDifMP sample paths. Second, we extend existing ABC summary statistics for diffusion processes to account for the hybrid nature of PDifMPs, showing particular effectiveness for ergodic systems. Third, we demonstrate our approach on several representative example PDifMPs that empirically exhibit ergodic behaviour. Our results show that the proposed ABC method reliably recovers model parameters across all examples, even in challenging scenarios where only partial information on jumps and diffusion is available or when parameters appear in state-dependent jump rate functions. These findings highlight the potential of ABC as a practical tool for inference in various complex stochastic hybrid systems."}

For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs.

Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $μ$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $μ$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\\varepsilon \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \\asymp \\varepsilon^{-2d-2}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees.

The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes."}

The framework is then extended by endogenizing disaster intensity via a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, showing how environmental degradation amplifies macroeconomic risk and strengthens incentives for abatement. A further extension introduces pollution diffusion alongside state-dependent jump intensity, yielding a tractable jump-diffusion HJB that decomposes naturally into capital and pollution components under power-type value functions.

We study the degree to which such extensions are unique up to the boundary. Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordström spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems."}

In particular, black hole solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics feature central singularities that signal the incompleteness of the theory in high curvature regimes. This thesis is devoted to the study of modified theories of gravity that aim to resolve these singularities and construct physically viable models of regular black holes: black holes that retain an event horizon but exhibit no curvature divergence anywhere in the spacetime ... Throughout the thesis, particular care is taken to ensure that the proposed models are physically sensible: they reduce to GR in the appropriate limits and lead to well behaved curvature scalars. Collectively, these results highlight the viability of regular black hole models in modified gravity theories, providing a promising path toward a consistent semiclassical description of black holes that avoids the need for quantum gravitational resolution of singularities.

Not only must they provide optimal uniform guarantees on the entire problem class, but also on any subclass determined by information revealed during the execution of the algorithm. In the setting of nonsmooth convex optimization with a subgradient oracle, we show that the Kelley cutting plane-Like Method due to Drori and Teboulle [1] is subgame perfect. For nonsmooth convex optimization with a proximal operator oracle, we develop a new algorithm, the Subgame Perfect Proximal Point Algorithm, and establish that it is subgame perfect.

The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena."}

Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games."}

While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms."}

Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.\n  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\\mathsf{d}-2\\le \\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case."}

Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture.

In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry."}

In this work, we resolve this question under the assumption that the noise coefficients are sufficiently regular in space. Our approach relies on Kunita's stochastic method of characteristics, which allows us to transform the original SPDE-via a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms-into a random PDE to which the classical De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates apply.

The main examples of half-Lie groups are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. We show that the Euler--Lagrange flow exists globally. We then introduce three thresholds of the energy, called the Ma~ne critical values, and prove that under mild regularity and completeness assumptions on the half-Lie group, any two points can be connected by a global Tonelli minimizer above the lowest of these energy thresholds. Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow.

The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example."}

For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete.

We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach. First, we prove sublinear convergence for non-convex dual objectives and linear convergence under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition.

The proposed algorithm is then applied to the motivating example."}

This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schröder paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations."}

In this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of submultiplexes, the counterparts of subgraphs (motifs) in single-layer networks, in the correlated Erdős-Rényi multiplex model. This is a random multiplex model with two layers, where the graphs in each layer marginally follow the classical (single-layer) Erdős-Rényi model, while the edges across layers are correlated. We derive the precise threshold condition for the emergence of a fixed submultiplex $\\boldsymbol{H}$ in a random multiplex sampled from the correlated Erdős-Rényi model. Specifically, we show that the satisfiability region, the regime where the random multiplex contains infinitely many copies of $\\boldsymbol{H}$, forms a polyhedral subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Furthermore, within this region the count of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ is asymptotically normal, with an explicit convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance. We also establish various Poisson approximation results for the count of $\\boldsymbol{H}$ on the boundary of the threshold, which depends on a notion of balance of submultiplexes. Collectively, these results provide an asymptotic theory for small submultiplexes in the correlated multiplex model, analogous to the classical theory of small subgraphs in random graphs."}

Which graphs always drive all nodes to converge to a single point, no matter where they start? This is known as the global synchronization problem of the Kuramoto model and is closely tied to the benign nonconvexity of its synchronization landscape. In this work, we show how this dynamical and continuous question can be reduced to a static and combinatorial one. We prove that threshold graphs, the graph class closed under adding isolated nodes and adding universal nodes, are globally synchronizing, based purely on a combinatorial analysis of unit-vector configurations in the plane. It is particularly striking that threshold graphs range from extremely sparse structures such as stars to the complete graph, suggesting that global synchronization in this class cannot be attributed to density. Our proof shows that global synchronization can instead emerge from a form of geometric symmetry."}

In addition, explore several other properties of $Δ_D(G)$ like Eulerianess, universality and connectedness of reduced deep commuting graphs.\n  Next, we classify the finite abelian groups for which deep commuting graphs coincide with enhance power graphs. We also characterize the dominant vertices for the deep commuting graphs of finite abelian groups and examine the connectedness of the associated reduced deep commuting graphs.

We call this class $\\hbar$-perfect, as it extends the class of perfect and $h$-perfect graphs.\n  Having an $\\hbar$-perfect graph opens up several applications: we find efficient schemes for entanglement detection, a connection to the complexity of shadow tomography, tight uncertainty relations and a construction for computing good lower on bounds ground state energies.

Albeit those algorithms do not immediately promise an advantage in runtime, we show that an approximate Hamilton encoding of the independence number can be achieved with an amount of qubits that typically scales logarithmically in the number of vertices.
