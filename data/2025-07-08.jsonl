By definition, a silver number is\nthe largest positive root of a certain polynomial called silver polynomial. In\nturn, a corresponding companion matrix of a silver polynomial gives rise to a\nwell known construction of inflationary tilings of the (non-negative) real\nhalf-line, via an iteration of inflation and substitution. Resnikoff noted for\nthe golden number $\\phi$ that this tiling corresponds to the set of what he\ncalled $\\phi$-integers. We generalize this result for a special class of silver\nnumbers, the distinguished silver numbers, by showing that the integers for a\ndistinguished silver number give rise to a tiling, of which we provide a\nprecise description. For the general problem, whether the integers for an\narbitrary silver number give rise to a tiling, we cannot give a general answer,\nbut we show that tilings are obtained if and only if the differences of silver\nintegers satisfy a (rather weak looking) non-accumulation condition. If tilings\nof this type exist for certain (necessarily non-distinguished) silver numbers,\nthey would seem to form a class of inflationary tilings that differs from those\nobtained by inflation and substitution. In an Appendix we recall necessary\nnotions and -- mostly known -- results, including the inflation-substitution\nconstruction principle for (one dimensional) inflationary tilings, in an\nelementary manner. For the readers' convenience we also collect the pertinent\nfacts about non-negative matrices, thus the construction is accessible with\nonly basic prerequisites from linear algebra and analysis.

While this result overcame previous\nbarriers and impossibility results for Hamming LDCs, it is not clear whether\nthe techniques extend to Insdel LDCs. Constructing Insdel LDCs which are\nresilient to insertion and/or deletion errors is known to be even more\nchallenging.\n  Our first contribution is to provide a Hamming-to-Insdel compiler which\ntransforms any amortized Hamming LDC that satisfies a particular property to\namortized Insdel LDC while asymptotically preserving the rate, error tolerance\nand amortized locality. Prior Hamming-to-Insdel compilers worked for arbitrary\nHamming LDCs, but incurred an undesirable polylogarithmic blow-up in the\nlocality.

It has been shown, so far via\npurely algebraic tools, that an analogous characterisation holds for standard\nbases with a generalised notion of confluence. Subsequently, that result is\nutilised to prove that two generalised confluence properties, where one is\nactually in general strictly stronger than the other, are actually equivalent\nin the context of formal power series. In the present paper, we propose\nalternative proofs making use of tools purely from the new theory of\ntopological rewriting to recover both the characterisation of standard bases\nand the equivalence between generalised confluence properties. The objective is\nto extend the analogy between Gr\\\"obner basis theory together with classical\nalgebraic rewriting theory and standard basis theory with topological rewriting\ntheory."}

This model is due to\nKenneth J. Arrow and Gerard Debreu in their pioneering work from 1954. An\nabstract economy is an extension of John Nash's original concept of a\nnon-cooperative game from the 1950's. Here players selfishly seek to maximize\ntheir profits, which may depend on the others' choices. The novelty of an\nabstract economy is that the players may now mutually constrain each-other in\ntheir decision-making. A Nash equilibrium is reached when no player alone can\nincrease his profit by a unilateral change of strategy. Abstract economies have\nfound widespread applications from welfare economy, economic analysis and\npolicy-making to constrained optimization, partial differential equations and\noptimal allocation.\n  We generalize Leigh Tesfatsion's Nash equilibrium existence result to\nabstract economies without resorting to commonly employed convexity\nassumptions, thereby also re-proving all known Nash equilibrium existence\nresults as special cases. A key element of our proof is the translation of the\nGeneralized Nash Equilibrium Problem into the question of the existence of a\ncoincidence of two particularly defined maps, and the application of a\ncoincidence result from algebraic topology due to Samuel Eilenberg and Deane\nMontgomery in 1946."}

However, since the decoder does not have prior\nknowledge of the original symbols, it must treat the artificially introduced\nsymbols as if they were independent. Consequently, these additional symbols\nmust be transmitted, even though their conditional probability, under ideal and\nerror free conditions, would be zero. This sequence extension implies that not\nall symbol combinations of the new length are practically realizable: if an\nerror modifies a sequence, making it inadmissible such an error becomes\ndetectable. Recent developments in Set Shaping Theory have revealed a\nsurprising result: it is always possible to transform a sequence into a longer\nversion by carefully selecting which longer sequences are allowed, in such a\nway that the overall set of sequences becomes more structured and less complex\nthan the original. This means that even though the sequence is extended and\ndependencies are introduced between symbols, the total amount of information\ncontained in the new set does not increase proportionally on the contrary, it\ncan be slightly reduced. In other words, one can construct a new set of longer\nsequences where each one corresponds uniquely to an original sequence, but the\nentire set is designed in such a way that it can be treated as if the symbols\nwere independent, making encoding simpler.

In this\nwork, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a\nsimple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial.

The current literature\nlacks formulations that fully address this challenge. Hence, we formulate an\nintegrated problem that maximizes total expected cost savings by offering task\nbundles to occasional drivers. To this end, we simultaneously determine the\noptimal bundle set, their assignment to occasional drivers, and compensations\nfor each pair while considering acceptance probabilities, which are captured\nvia generic logistic functions.

However,\ntraditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS)\nassumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing\ntransmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex\nenvironments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers\nfrom signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To\naddress this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable\nenvironment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel\nknowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware\nwireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the\nsame CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS\nwireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one\nstone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment\n(UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the\nsensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We\nillustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \\emph{channel\nangle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to\nderive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship\nbetween communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing\ntarget localization in the challenging NLoS environment.

High-order methods such as the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme are attractive candidates for their\nnumerical approximation. However, high-order methods are prone to instabilities\nin the presence of underresolved flow features. A popular counter measure to\nstabilize DG methods is the use of entropy-stable formulations based on\nsummation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The present paper aims to construct a\nrobust and efficient entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element\nmethod (DGSEM) of arbitrary order on heterogeneous, curvilinear grids composed\nof triangular and quadrilateral elements or hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral\nand pyramid elements. To the author's knowledge, with the exception of\nhexahedral and quadrilateral elements, entropy-stable DGSE operators have been\nconstructed exclusively for tetrahedral and triangular meshes. The extension of\nthe DGSEM to more complex element shapes is achieved by means of a collapsed\ncoordinate transformation. Legendre--Gauss quadrature nodes are employed as\ncollocation points in conjunction with a generalized SBP operator and\nentropy-projected variables. The purely hyperbolic operator is extended to\nhyperbolic-parabolic problems by the use of a lifting procedure. To circumvent\nthe penalizing time step restriction imposed by the collapsing, modal rather\nthan nodal degrees of freedom are evolved in time, thereby relying on a\nmemory-efficient weight-adjusted approximation to the inverse of the mass\nmatrix. Essential properties of the proposed numerical scheme including\nfree-stream preservation, polynomial and grid convergence as well as entropy\nconservation / stability are verified.

The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs\nachieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors < 0.000806%).\nWhile for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below\n0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness."}

In particular, under\nmild regularity assumptions on the convergence rate of Gradient Flow, we\nestablish that mu_{beta} satisfies a Poincar\\'e Inequality with constant\nO(C'+1/beta) for beta >= Omega(d), where C' is the Poincar\\'e constant of\nmu_{beta} restricted to a neighborhood of the global minimizers of F. Under an\nadditional mild condition on F, we show that mu_{beta} satisfies a Log-Sobolev\nInequality with constant O(beta max(S, 1) max(C', 1)) where S denotes the\nsecond moment of mu_{beta}. Here asymptotic notation hides F-dependent\nparameters. At a high level, this establishes that optimizability via Gradient\nFlow from every initialization implies a Poincar\\'e and Log-Sobolev Inequality\nfor the low-temperature Gibbs measure, which in turn imply sampling from all\ninitializations.\n  Analogously, we establish that under the same assumptions, if F can be\ninitialized from everywhere except some set S, then mu_{beta} satisfies a Weak\nPoincar\\'e Inequality with parameters (O(C'+1/beta), O(mu_{beta}(S))) for \\beta\n= Omega(d). At a high level, this shows while optimizability from 'most'\ninitializations implies a Weak Poincar\\'e Inequality, which in turn implies\nsampling from suitable warm starts. Our regularity assumptions are mild and as\na consequence, we show we can efficiently sample from several new natural and\ninteresting classes of non-log-concave densities, an important setting with\nrelatively few examples. As another corollary, we obtain efficient\ndiscrete-time sampling results for log-concave measures satisfying milder\nregularity conditions than smoothness, similar to Lehec (2023)."}

In most hospitals in Japan, this responsibility falls to the head nurse\nof each ward. The physical and mental burden of this task is considerable, and\nrecent challenges such as the growing shortage of nurses and increasingly\ndiverse working styles have further complicated the scheduling process.\nConsequently, there is a growing demand for automated nurse scheduling systems.\nTechnically, modern integer programming solvers can generate feasible schedules\nwithin a practical timeframe. However, in many hospitals, schedules are still\ncreated manually. This is largely because tacit knowledge, considerations\nunconsciously applied by head nurses, cannot be fully formalized into explicit\nconstraints, often resulting in automatically generated schedules that are not\npractically usable. To address this issue, we propose a novel \"two-stage\nscheduling method.\" This approach divides the scheduling task into night shift\nand day shift stages, allowing head nurses to make manual adjustments after the\nfirst stage.

No other types of phase transitions of\nergodicity are known, and the behavior of known counterexamples under\nintermediate noise rates is unknown.\n  We present an example of a cellular automaton with two phase transitions.\nUsing G\\'acs's result as a black box, we construct a cellular automaton that is\nergodic under small noise rates, non-ergodic for slightly higher rates, and\nagain ergodic for rates close to 1."}

One recent\ntrend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be\ncontrolled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a\nstacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy\ncommunities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation\ncapacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we\nstudy settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery\noperator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology\nfor determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented,\nsuch that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery\noperator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and\nprices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of\ntariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a\nsystematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when\ndeployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing\napproaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of\nimportant limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of\nregularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we\ninvestigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and\nbattery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in\nthe Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community\nof 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year\nby renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental\ncosts), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and\ntariff types."}
