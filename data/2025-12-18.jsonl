We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy."}

In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis."}

The performance of these algorithms strongly depends on the choice of the gridding kernel, with the first prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) regarded as optimal. This work redefines kernel optimality through the lens of vector optimization (VO), introducing a rigorous framework that characterizes optimal kernels as Pareto-efficient solutions of an error shape operator. We establish the continuity of such operator, study the existence of solutions, and propose a novel methodology to construct kernels tailored to a desired target error function. The approach is implemented numerically via interior-point optimization. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels outperform both the PSWF and the state-of-the-art methods (MIRT-NUFFT) in specific regions of interest, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in mean absolute errors. These results confirm the potential of VO-based kernel design to provide customized accuracy profiles aligned with application-specific requirements. Future research will extend this framework to multidimensional cases and relative error minimization, with potential integration of machine learning for adaptive target error selection."}

The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method."}

Motivated by Bourgain's construction, we introduce a strengthened, subsequence-invariant notion of Cauchy sequence: a sequence $(x_n)$ in a vector lattice $E$ is called Buo-Cauchy if for every strictly increasing sequence $(n_k)$ the differences $x_{n_{k+1}}-x_{n_k}$ converge to $0$ in order in $E$.

In this problem, the decision maker considers items for which either weights or values, or both, are random. The aim is to select a subset of these items to be included into their knapsack. We study both \"static\" and \"dynamic\" variants of this problem: in the static setting, the decision about which items should be included in the knapsack is taken at the outset, before any random item value or weight is revealed; in the dynamic setting, items are received sequentially, and the decision about a particular item is made by taking into account previously observed values and weights. The knapsack has a given capacity, and if the total realised weight exceeds this capacity then a penalty cost is incurred for each unit of excess capacity utilised. The goal is to maximise the expected net profit. We tackle the case of normally distributed item weights and we show that our approach extends seamlessly to the case in which item weights are correlated and follow a multivariate normal distribution. In addition, we show our approach represents an effective heuristic for the case in which item weights follow generic probability distributions. In an extensive computational study we demonstrate that our models are near-optimal and more scalable than other state-of-the-art approaches."}

Our work focuses on local quadratic approximations of the associated Gaussian fields. Local quadratic approximations to random fields are random polynomials parametrized by a jointly sampled gradient vector and Hessian matrix. We characterize the distribution of the corresponding random vectors and random matrices. Then, we study the error in the quadratic approximation, which is also a Gaussian field. We investigate the error induced by the quadratic approximation in three senses: the pointwise error, the maximal error over an ellipsoidal region, and the worst-case error for multivariate Gaussian inputs at a given confidence level. Next, we explore the limiting behavior of the worst-case error as the distance between an expansion point and evaluation points approaches zero and infinity.

However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively."}

Our work focuses on local quadratic approximations of the associated Gaussian fields. Local quadratic approximations to random fields are random polynomials parametrized by a jointly sampled gradient vector and Hessian matrix. We characterize the distribution of the corresponding random vectors and random matrices. Then, we study the error in the quadratic approximation, which is also a Gaussian field. We investigate the error induced by the quadratic approximation in three senses: the pointwise error, the maximal error over an ellipsoidal region, and the worst-case error for multivariate Gaussian inputs at a given confidence level. Next, we explore the limiting behavior of the worst-case error as the distance between an expansion point and evaluation points approaches zero and infinity. Finally, we study how, as the input dimension increases, the variance of multivariate Gaussian distributions must be restricted to keep the worst-case error bound constant."}

In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be \"detained\" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept \"information debt\" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a \"band fashion\" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels."}

Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \\(s(p)\\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \\(p\\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \\(\\max_{1\\le p\\le k} p\\,s^2(p)\\,\\log n\\), which matches the classical \\(k^2\\log n\\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \\(k\\log n\\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms."}

For general matrices, we establish determinant identities for bordered Gramian matrices that decompose CUR approximation errors into interpretable local components. These identities connect projection errors onto submatrix column spaces directly to determinants, providing geometric insight into approximation degradation. We develop a probabilistic framework based on volume sampling that yields interpolation-type error bounds quantifying the benefits of oversampling: when $r > k$ rows are selected for $k$ columns, the expected error factor transitions linearly from $(k+1)^2$ (no oversampling) to $(k+1)$ (full oversampling). Our analysis establishes that the expected squared error is bounded by this interpolation factor times the squared error of the best rank-$k$ approximation, directly connecting CUR approximation quality to the optimal low-rank approximation. The framework applies to both CUR decomposition for general matrices and the Nyström method for symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, providing a unified theoretical foundation for determinant-based low-rank approximation analysis."}

This seems to be the first result on $[0,τ]$ for arbitrary $τ> 0$ for a model coupling moisture dynamics to heat-conducting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the micro-physics model is that it also includes phase changes of water in moist air. These phase changes are associated with large amounts of latent heat and thus result in a strong coupling to the thermodynamic equation. The well-posedness results are obtained by means of a Lagrangian approach, which allows to treat the hyperbolicity in the continuity equation. More precisely, optimal $\\mathrm{L}^p$-$\\mathrm{L}^q$ estimates are shown for the linearized system, leading to the local well-posedness result by a fixed point argument and suitable nonlinear estimates.

However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol."}

This method can be combined with any multi-target regression model and guarantees finite-sample coverage. It is computationally efficient and yields informative prediction intervals even with limited data. The core idea is a novel \\emph{coordinate-wise} standardization procedure that makes residuals across output dimensions directly comparable, estimating suitable scaling parameters using the calibration data themselves. This does not require modeling of cross-output dependence nor auxiliary sample splitting. Implementing this idea requires overcoming technical challenges associated with transductive or full conformal prediction. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate this method can produce tighter prediction intervals than existing baselines while maintaining valid simultaneous coverage."}

The derivatives used on test functions in Gan & Ross (2021) were directional type derivatives specifically chosen for their measure preserving properties. Depending upon the application, these derivatives can prove cumbersome. In this note, we show that for certain test functions we can instead use more traditional derivatives, which simplifies the bounds for the Stein factors and is more amenable to the approximation of the inclusion process."}

We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy."}

In this work, we propose that using geometric information -- when available -- to assist with setting up the AMG hierarchy is beneficial, especially for solving linear systems resulting from high-order finite element discretizations. High-order problems draw considerable interest to both the scientific and engineering communities, but lack efficient solvers, at least open-source codes, tailored for unstructured high-order discretizations targeting large-scale, real-world applications. For geometric multigrid, it is known that using p-coarsening before h-coarsening can provide better scalability, but setting up p-coarsening is non-trivial in AMG. We develop a geometrically informed algebraic multigrid (GIAMG) method, as well as an associated high-performance computing program, which is able to set up a grid hierarchy that includes p-coarsening at the top grids with minimal information of the geometry from the user. A major advantage of using p-coarsening with AMG -- beyond the benefits known in the context of geometric multigrid (GMG) -- is the increased sparsification of coarse grid operators. We extensively evaluate GIAMG by testing on the 3D Helmholtz and incompressible flow problems, and demonstrate mesh-independent convergence, and excellent parallel scalability. We also compare the performance of GIAMG with existing AMG packages, including Hypre and ML."}

Within a kinetic modeling framework, we describe the evolution of the coupled dynamics of opinions and network structure, incorporating a class of control laws in order to promote interactions with popular individuals and amplify dominant opinions. Such control strategies are introduced to influence both opinion formation and connectivity, representing interventions such as awareness campaigns or moderation policies. Numerical results show how control strategies can mitigate polarization, foster consensus, or guide opinion distributions in dynamically evolving networks."}

In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis."}

Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A.

Gray and Ruškuc (2024) gave the first example of a finitely presented SIM whose submonoid of right units does not admit a decomposition into a free product of the group of units and a finite rank free monoid. In the first part of this paper we prove a general result which shows that the only instances where the right units of a finitely presented SIM can admit such a free product decomposition is when their group of units is finitely presented. In showing this, we establish some general results about finite generation and presentability of subgroups of SIMs. In particular, we give an exact characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely generated in terms of connectedness properties of unions of its cosets in its $\\mathscr{R}$-class, and also a characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely presented. We also give a sufficient condition for finite generation and presentability of an arbitrary subgroup given in terms of a geometric finiteness property called boundary width. As a consequence, we show that the classes of monoids of right units of finitely presented SIMs and prefix monoids of finitely presented groups are independent. In the second part of the paper, we show that every finitely generated submonoid of a finitely RC-presented monoid is isomorphic to a submonoid $N$ of a finitely presented SIM $M$ such that $N$ is a submonoid of the right units of $M$, and $N$ contains the group of units of $M$. This result generalises and extends the classification of groups of units of finitely presented SIMs recently obtained by Gray and Kambites (2025). From this, we derive a number of surprising properties of RC-presentations for right cancellative monoids contrasting the classical theory of monoid presentations."}

The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \\emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples.

Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes."}

The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design. Extensive numerical results validate the promising efficacy of the proposed algorithm designs and the derived analytical findings."}

However, a straightforward extension to stochastic problems requires an estimate of $\\nabla_{xt} f(x;t)$ and the computation of a Hessian inverse at each step--requirements that are difficult or costly in practice.

In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting.

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices.

Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way.

Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments.

Specifically, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions for the two-dimensional radially symmetric viscous shallow water equations with arbitrary smooth initial data. To achieve this goal, our approach relies crucially on overcoming two major obstacles: first, treating the viscous Saint-Venant system as the endpoint case of the BD entropy condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations; and second, addressing the critical embedding imposed by the spatial dimension, which currently holds only in two dimensions. However, the same result can be extended to three dimension for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying general BD entropy conditions excluding the endpoint case. Indeed, under the same symmtric framework, we also prove the global existence of smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data for both the two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition.

Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios."}

The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability."}

For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested. Numerical experiments on a beam-shaped plate and a plate with a hole for one- and two-dimensional parameter spaces show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy for both morphing methods and performs significantly better than two existing approaches for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes."}

We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\\leq 7$, of which over $70\\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database.

To find out which of these measures are best used for generating robust schedules, we perform an elaborate simulation study to investigate how well these robustness measures correlate with the stability of the objective function under disturbances (quality robustness) and with the stability of the schedule itself (solution robustness). We first consider the Stochastic Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (SPMSP) with precedence constraints, which is a very general setting that is relevant for many practical situations. We then perform a second simulation study by taking the best performing measures from the first experiment, and using them for the Train Unit Shunting Problem with Service Scheduling (TUSPwSS). After establishing the correlation with quality and solution robustness, we included the measures as objective in a local search algorithm. We make a comparison between the theoretical setting of the SPMSP and the TUSPwSS, and identify a set of robustness measures that can be applied in many different settings. We show that we can achieve up to 90% decreases in delays compared to using no robustness measures.

Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments."}

While explicit MPC and neural network approximations mitigate this burden, they suffer from scalability issues or lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This work introduces a data-driven framework that directly learns the Linear MPC control law from sampled state-action pairs using Oblique Decision Trees with Linear Predictions (ODT-LP), achieving both computational efficiency and interpretability. By leveraging the piecewise affine structure of Linear MPC, we prove that the Linear MPC control law can be replicated by finite-depth ODT-LP models. We develop a gradient-based training algorithm using smooth approximations of tree routing functions to learn this structure from grid-sampled Linear MPC solutions, enabling end-to-end optimization. Input-to-state stability is established under bounded approximation errors, with explicit error decomposition into learning inaccuracies and sampling errors to inform model design. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ODT-LP controllers match MPC's closed-loop performance while reducing online evaluation time by orders of magnitude compared to MPC, explicit MPC, neural network, and random forest counterparts. The transparent tree structure enables formal verification of control logic, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and certifiable reliability for safety-critical systems."}

Such systems arise when advanced control and optimization tools are needed to overcome the limitations of smooth feedback methods and to satisfy demanding transient and steady-state requirements in high-performance applications. They also appear when controllers must operate on plants that inherently exhibit hybrid behaviors, as is common in cyber-physical and autonomous systems that rely on digital sensing, computation, and actuation. To study hybrid extremum-seeking dynamics through control-theoretic methods, we first review the key concepts that support the development of perturbation theory for hybrid inclusions, forming the basis for averaging and singular perturbation analyses. We then show how these ideas apply to the design and evaluation of hybrid extremum-seeking algorithms for static and dynamic plants. Several examples are presented, including set-valued and switching algorithms under different switching regimes such as arbitrarily fast switching, dwell-time and average dwell-time constraints, and average activation time conditions. We also discuss state-based switching extremum seeking for obstacle-avoidance problems and gradient-Newton switching schemes. Additional topics include momentum-based and reset-type extremum seeking, intermittent updates, slowly varying parameters, hybrid filters, and safety-aware schemes that incorporate constraints. Across all these settings, we illustrate how perturbation-based methods traditionally used for extremum-seeking control naturally extend to hybrid systems when mild regularity assumptions are satisfied, and solutions are modeled on hybrid time domains."}

The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments."}

We derive condition-number bounds for the resulting operator and prove spectral convergence estimates for both the electric and magnetic fields. Numerical experiments for three-dimensional electromagnetic test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that the TT-based solver maintains accuracy with approximately linear complexity in the number of grid points in space and time."}

Deterministic methods can produce accurate solutions without any statistical noise, yet often at a price of expensive computational costs originating from the intrinsic high dimensionality of the model. With this work, we present the first systematic investigation of projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) following the reduced basis method (RBM) framework to simulate the parametric steady-state RTE with isotropic scattering and one energy group. Four ROMs are designed, with each defining a nested family of reduced surrogate solvers of different resolution/fidelity. They are based on either a Galerkin or least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and utilize either an $L_1$ or residual-based importance/error indicator. Two of the proposed ROMs are certified in the setting when the absorption cross section is positively bounded below uniformly. One technical focus and contribution lie in the proposed implementation strategies under the affine assumption of the parameter dependence of the model. These well-crafted broadly applicable strategies not only ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the offline training stage and the online prediction of reduced surrogate solvers, they also take into account the conditioning of the reduced systems as well as the stagnation-free residual evaluation for numerical robustness. Computational complexities are derived for both the offline training and online prediction stages of the proposed model order reduction strategies, and they are demonstrated numerically along with the accuracy and robustness of the reduced surrogate solvers. Numerically we observe four to six orders of magnitude speedup of our ROMs compared to full order models for some 2D2v examples."}

Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $ψ$, and discount rate $δ$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.\n  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.\n  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \\textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \\textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \\textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules.

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline."}

One popular time integration scheme is the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), in which the time integration is constrained to a low-rank manifold.

While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future."}

However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling."}

In this study, we develop a multiscale circulation model by coupling a systemic hemodynamic framework with a cerebral arterial network reconstructed from medical imaging. The model incorporates a cerebral autoregulation mechanism (CAM) and enables quantitative simulation of flow redistribution within the CoW under normal, anatomically varied, and stenotic conditions. Baseline simulations reproduce physiological flow distributions in which communicating arteries remain nearly inactive, showing negligible cross-flow and agreement with clinical measurements. In contrast, anatomical variations reveal distinct collateral activation patterns: the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) emerges as the earliest and most sensitive functional collateral, whereas the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) exhibit structure-dependent engagement. Progressive stenosis simulations further demonstrate a transition from a complete CoW to a fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (PCA) configuration, characterized by early ACoA flow reversal followed by ipsilateral PCoA activation, consistent with experimental and transcranial Doppler observations. Finally, a path-based quantitative analysis is introduced to illustrate how the cerebral vascular network dynamically reconfigures collateral pathways in response to structural changes. Overall, the proposed framework provides a physiologically interpretable, image-informed tool for investigating cerebral flow regulation through functional collaterals within the CoW, with potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cerebrovascular diseases."}

As a model on the detailed scale, we start from a parabolic relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. We consider a sequence of initial data where the sequence of initial densities is assumed to be highly oscillating mimicking the high number of phase boundaries initially. Then, we consider a sequence of finite energy weak solutions corresponding to the sequence of initial data. Anticipating that the effective equations are found in the limit of infinitely many initial phase changes, we interpret the densities as Young measures and prove the convergence of the sequence of solutions to the effective model. The effective model consists of a deterministic part for the fluid's hydrodynamic quantities and a kinetic equation for the limit Young measure encoding the mixing dynamics. By characterizing the Young measure with the corresponding cumulative distribution function, we rewrite the kinetic equation for the Young measure into a kinetic equation for the cumulative distribution function such that the resulting equations are accessible by standard approximation methods."}

The situation is less clear in the time domain, where recent works suggest the presence of an additional temporal scale that quantifies the smallness of the obstacle. In this paper we argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that it is possible to construct asymptotic models with an error that does not deteriorate in time, at least in the case of a sound-soft scattering problem by a star-shaped obstacle in 3D."}

We establish basic properties of this notion of solution and show that it coincides with the Perron solution. Variational solutions can elegantly be characterised in terms of the given boundary function when the variational solution has finite energy. However, it is impossible to decide in terms of the regularity of the given boundary function when a classical solution exists. We demonstrate this by analysing Lebesgue's cusp, and more precisely Lebesgue's domain which is associated with the potential of a thin rod with mass density going to zero at one end. We also show that the non-continuity of the Perron solution at a singular point is a generic and non-local property."}

In this work, we extend this framework to a stochastic regime by considering the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to either additive or multiplicative noise. We establish sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial observation scale that guarantee convergence of the nudged solution to the true stochastic flow.\n  In the case of multiplicative noise, convergence holds in expectation, with exponential or polynomial rates depending on the growth of the noise covariance. For additive noise, we obtain the exponential convergence both in expectation and pathwise. These results yield a stochastic generalization of the AOT theory, demonstrating how the interplay between random forcing, viscous dissipation and feedback control governs synchronization in stochastic fluid systems."}

Gibbon", "Dario Vincenzi"], "title": "Estimates for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: the effects of forcing", "categories": ["physics.flu-dyn", "math.AP", "nlin.CD"], "comment": null, "summary": "Mathematical estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations are traditionally expressed in terms of the Grashof number, which is a dimensionless measure of the magnitude of the forcing and hence a control parameter of the system. However, experimental measurements and statistical theories of turbulence are based on the Reynolds number. Thus, a meaningful comparison between mathematical and physical results requires a conversion of the mathematical estimates to a Reynolds-dependent form. In two dimensions, this was achieved under the assumption that the second derivative of the forcing is square integrable. Nonetheless, numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenology of turbulence is sensitive to the degree of regularity of the forcing. Therefore, we extend the available estimates for the energy and enstrophy dissipation rates as well as the attractor dimension to forcings in the Sobolev space of order $s$; i.e. forcings whose Fourier coefficients decay with the wavenumber $k$ faster than $k^{-s-1}$. We consider the range $-1\\leqslant s\\leqslant 2$, where $s=2$ corresponds to the known estimates, and $s=-1$ is the smallest value of $s$ for which weak solutions are known to exist. The main result is the existence of three distinct regimes as a function of the regularity of the forcing."}
