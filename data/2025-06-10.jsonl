Theorems proved by Kegejan and\nKhrushchev state that if $E$ has positive Lebesgue measure and satisfies a\ngeneralized Beurling-Carleson condition, then for an appropriate majorant the\nKhinchin-Ostrowski property is satisfied. A technical point in Khrushchev's\nproof is the estimation of the harmonic measure in a Privalov-type domain which\nrequires logarithmic integrability of the majorant. This forbids the\napplication of his result to certain types of generalized Beurling-Carleson\nconditions. Here, we dispose of the integrability assumption on the majorant.\nTo do so, we use a Joukowski-Privalov domain which is obtained by removing from\nthe unit disk the areas enclosed by hyperbolic geodesics between the endpoints\nof intervals complementary to $E$. For this type of domain the method of\nKhrushchev applies, but the harmonic measure may be estimated more accurately\nby simple explicit formulas for conformal mappings. As a consequence, we find\nthe critical majorant at which Beurling-Carleson type conditions stop\ndetermining the Khinchin-Ostrowski property of a set, and above which the\ncontainment of intervals is the only relevant characteristic. We discuss also\nweighted versions of the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, and apply our result to\nestablish the remarkable precision of a one-sided spectral decay condition\nwhich detects the local logarithmic integrability of a function."}

Traditional time-frequency (TF) domain anti-jamming methods\nare prone to TF aliasing in multi-component signal scenarios, and cannot\neffectively suppress ISRJ with energy close to the real target under low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an anti-jamming method based on generalized linear canonical Wigner\ndistribution (GLWD) line detection. By setting the parameters reasonably, the\nTF image of GLWD can have excellent TF resolution and energy concentration,\ngreatly improving the signal separation and SNR. Furthermore, in order to\nenhance the detection capability of the target LFM signal, the existing mobile\nline segment detection (M-LSD) is improved and the mobile long line segment\ndetection (M-LLSD) is proposed. M-LLSD can detect the target signal more easily\nand reduce the sensitivity to the jamming signal, so as to efficiently and\naccurately extract the TF position information of the target signal. Finally, a\nTF filter is constructed based on the mapping between GLWD and short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), performing filtering in the STFT domain to suppress\njamming. Simulations and experiments show that the method can effectively\nsuppress such difficult-to-distinguish jamming and is suitable for real-time\nradar anti-jamming with good robustness."}

Given a\nmajorant determining a growth restriction on functions in the unit disk\n$\\mathbb{D}$, we say that a set $E$ on the unit circle $\\mathbb{T}$ is a\nuniqueness set, or has the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, with respect to the\nmajorant, if any sequence of analytic polynomials satisfying the growth\nrestriction which converges in an appropriate sense to $0$ on $E$, in fact is\nforced to converge to $0$ in $\\mathbb{D}$ also. Theorems proved by Kegejan and\nKhrushchev state that if $E$ has positive Lebesgue measure and satisfies a\ngeneralized Beurling-Carleson condition, then for an appropriate majorant the\nKhinchin-Ostrowski property is satisfied. A technical point in Khrushchev's\nproof is the estimation of the harmonic measure in a Privalov-type domain which\nrequires logarithmic integrability of the majorant. This forbids the\napplication of his result to certain types of generalized Beurling-Carleson\nconditions. Here, we dispose of the integrability assumption on the majorant.\nTo do so, we use a Joukowski-Privalov domain which is obtained by removing from\nthe unit disk the areas enclosed by hyperbolic geodesics between the endpoints\nof intervals complementary to $E$. For this type of domain the method of\nKhrushchev applies, but the harmonic measure may be estimated more accurately\nby simple explicit formulas for conformal mappings. As a consequence, we find\nthe critical majorant at which Beurling-Carleson type conditions stop\ndetermining the Khinchin-Ostrowski property of a set, and above which the\ncontainment of intervals is the only relevant characteristic. We discuss also\nweighted versions of the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, and apply our result to\nestablish the remarkable precision of a one-sided spectral decay condition\nwhich detects the local logarithmic integrability of a function."}

In this paper, it is shown that classical mixing criteria, e.g.\ntopological mixing or non-precompactness in $L^2$ for all nontrivial densities,\nfail to persist under arbitrarily small perturbations of velocity fields. A\nYoung-measure theory adapted to $L^\\infty$ data is then developed to\ncharacterize exactly which passive scalars mix.

All comments are welcome", "summary": "The primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method is one of the most popular\nalgorithms for solving saddle point problems. However, when applying the PDHG\nmethod and its many variants to some real-world models commonly encountered in\nsignal processing, imaging sciences, and statistical learning, there often\nexists an imbalance between the two subproblems, with the dual subproblem\ntypically being easier to solve than the primal one. In this paper, we propose\na flexible triple-Bregman balanced primal-dual algorithm (TBDA) to solve a\nclass of (not necessarily smooth) convex-concave saddle point problems with a\nbilinear coupling term. Specifically, our TBDA mainly consists of two dual\nsubproblems and one primal subproblem. Moreover, three Bregman proximal terms,\neach one with an individual Bregman kernel function, are embedded into the\nrespective subproblems. In this way, it effectively enables us to strike a\npractical balance between the primal and dual subproblems. More interestingly,\nit provides us a flexible algorithmic framework to understand some existing\niterative schemes and to produce customized structure-exploiting algorithms for\napplications. Theoretically, we first establish the global convergence and\nergodic convergence rate of the TBDA under some mild conditions. In particular,\nour TBDA allows larger step sizes than the PDHG method under appropriate\nparameter settings. Then, when the requirements on objective functions are\nfurther strengthened, we accordingly introduce two improved versions with\nbetter convergence rates than the original TBDA. Some numerical experiments on\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our TBDA performs better than the\nPDHG method and some other efficient variants in practice."}

Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the\n(constant) Yang-Baxter equation. So their classification problems are also\nequivalent. We consider both the categories $MoonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms\nare natural transformations and the category $MonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms\nare the monoidal natural transformations. This categorical contextualisation\nnaturally gives a three-fold focus to the problem: the source $B$; the target\n$Mat$; and the natural transformations and other symmetries between functors\nbetween them. Indeed the approach is mainly motivated by the recent\nclassification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which $Mat$ is\nreplaced by a certain subcategory. One objective is to understand from the\ncategorical perspective how the solution was facilitated by this change (with\nthe aim of generalising). Another is to understand appropriate notions of\nequivalence - the restriction of target introduces new notions such as that of\ninner and outer equivalences. And another is to understand how universal such a\nrestricted target is (does it give a transversal of all equivalence classes for\na suitable notion of equivalence?). And then the aim is to complete the\nclassification with a suitably universal target.\n  With regard to the first part of the triple-focus, the category $B$, we\nreview several features. Work has already been done to generalise to similar\ncategories such as the loop braid category.

Consequently, the sampled values of a function can be\ninterpreted as noisy samples of the values of its best approximation\npolynomial, with the noise equivalent to the remainder term's values at those\npoints.

This paper integrates FA with the receive spatial modulation (RSM)\nscheme and proposes a novel FA-empowered RSM (FA-RSM) system. In this system,\nthe transmitter is equipped with an FA that simultaneously activates multiple\nports to transmit precoded signals. We address three key challenges in the\nFA-RSM system: port selection, theoretical analysis, and detection. First, for\nport selection, an optimal algorithm from a capacity maximization perspective\nare proposed, followed by two low-complexity alternatives. Second, for\ntheoretical analysis, performance evaluation metrics are provided for port\nselection, which demonstrate that increasing the number of activated ports\nenhances system performance. Third, regarding detection, two low-complexity\ndetectors are proposed. Simulation results confirm that the FA-RSM system\nsignificantly outperforms the conventional RSM system. The proposed\nlow-complexity port selection algorithms facilitate minimal performance\ndegradation. Moreover, while activating additional ports improves performance,\nthe gain gradually saturates due to inherent spatial correlation, highlighting\nthe importance of effective port selection in reducing system complexity and\ncost.

Our analysis includes several\nclassical matroids, such as the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids, for which\nwe provide explicit finite generating sets for their associated matroid ideals.\nThe matroid ideal is the ideal of the matroid variety, whose construction\ninvolves a saturation step with respect to all the independence relations of\nthe matroid. This step is computationally very expensive and has only been\ncarried out for very small matroids. We provide a complete generating set of\nthese ideals for the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids. The proofs rely on\nclassical geometric techniques, including liftability arguments and the\nGrassmann--Cayley algebra, which we use to construct so-called bracket\npolynomials in these ideals. In addition, we prove that every cactus matroid is\nrealizable and that its matroid variety is irreducible."}

This step is computationally very expensive and has only been\ncarried out for very small matroids. We provide a complete generating set of\nthese ideals for the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids. The proofs rely on\nclassical geometric techniques, including liftability arguments and the\nGrassmann--Cayley algebra, which we use to construct so-called bracket\npolynomials in these ideals. In addition, we prove that every cactus matroid is\nrealizable and that its matroid variety is irreducible."}
