We construct a new globally-conforming discrete space, departing from standard discontinuous Trefftz formulations, and investigate its approximation properties, providing wavenumber-explicit best-approximation error estimates. The mesh is defined by intersecting the domain with a Cartesian grid, and the basis functions are continuous in the whole computational domain, compactly supported, and can be expressed as simple linear combinations of EPWs within each element. This ensures they remain local solutions to the Helmholtz equation and allows the system matrix to be assembled in closed form for polygonal domains. The discrete space provides stable approximations with bounded coefficients and spectral accuracy for analytic Helmholtz solutions. The approximation error is proved to decay exponentially both at a fixed frequency, with respect to the discretization parameters, and along suitable sequences of increasing wavenumbers, with the number of degrees of freedom scaling linearly with the frequency. Numerical results confirm these theoretical estimates for the full Galerkin error."}

The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x."}

For the semi-Lagrangian schemes equipped with the spline or Hermite interpolation operators of order $ 2 s - 1 $, we derive an $L^2$-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{2s} / Δt) $ and an $ H^s $-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{s} / \\sqrt{Δt}) $, where $ h $ and $ Δt $ denote the spatial mesh size and the time step size, respectively, and $ r \\in \\lparen 0, 1\\rbrack $ is a parameter determined by the discretization of the dispersive term.

However, whereas the matching distance depends on two parameters, the convex matching distance depends on only one, offering improved computational efficiency. We further show that the convex matching distance can be more discriminative than the traditional matching distance in certain cases, although the two metrics are generally not comparable. Moreover, we prove that the convex matching distance is stable and characterize the coefficients of the convex combination at which it is attained. Finally, we demonstrate that this new aggregation framework benefits from the computational advantages provided by the Pareto grid, a collection of curves in the plane whose points lie in the image of the Pareto critical set associated with functions assuming values on the real plane."}

As the interface self-intersects, Sobolev norms remain bounded, although analyticity is necessarily lost. This contrasts classical splash singularities, in which solutions remain analytic up to the time of self-intersection.\n  The narrowing gap bounded by these arcs is not occupied by plasma, as squeezing the plasma itself would cause blow-up in Sobolev norms. Instead, the gap represents the region outside the plasma, a vacuum carrying a nontrivial magnetic field. The plasma on either side pinches the field as the gap closes, and, in response, the field flattens to infinite order at the intersection point (and nowhere else), thereby forming an analytic singularity. This gives the first example of analytic breakdown without Sobolev blow-up in a locally well-posed free-boundary incompressible fluid system, and can be viewed as the first rigorous construction of a squeeze-type singularity, in which we study and quantify the precise behavior of an active, incompressible vector field as it is completely pinched off by a free-boundary in finite time.\n  The proof combines a magnetically-aligned Lagrangian formulation of ideal MHD together with weighted elliptic estimates in the vacuum that remain uniform as the width of the gap tends to zero. Our framework may provide a starting point for the analysis of squeeze-type singularities in other incompressible fluid models."}

Building on singular perturbation theory, the proposed design employs a two-time scale separation approach, with a fast time scale corresponding to communication and a slow time scale corresponding to agent motion. The resulting algorithm is distributed over the 2-hop Delaunay graph and, for small enough values of the perturbation parameter, achieves the same performance as its centralized counterpart. We also introduce three discrete-time versions that rely only on 1-hop communication at the cost of having to use delayed information and formally establish their asymptotic convergence properties. Our technical approach combines computational geometry, singular perturbation theory, generating functions, and linear iterations with delayed updates.

Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions.

While the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) framework provides a solution, it relies on equal-weight aggregation, which can be strictly suboptimal when views exhibit significant statistical heterogeneity (arising from varying SNR and dimensions) and structural heterogeneity (arising from individual components). In this paper, we propose HeteroJIVE, a weighted two-stage spectral algorithm tailored to such heterogeneity. Theoretically, we first revisit the ``non-diminishing\" error barrier with respect to the number of views $K$ identified in recent literature for the equal-weight case. We demonstrate that this barrier is not universal: under generic geometric conditions, the bias term vanishes and our estimator achieves the $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate without the need for iterative refinement. Extending this to the general-weight case, we establish error bounds that explicitly disentangle the two layers of heterogeneity. Based on this, we derive an oracle-optimal weighting scheme implemented via a data-driven procedure. Extensive simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, and an application to TCGA-BRCA multi-omics data validates the superiority of HeteroJIVE in practice."}

The introduction of the pseudo-stress variable is motivated by the growing interest in non-Newtonian flow models and coupled interface problems, where the stress field plays a fundamental role in the physical description. The space-time discretisation of the problem is obtained by combining the PolyDG approach in space with the implicit Euler method for time integration. The resulting linear system, characterised by a symmetric, positive, definite matrix, exhibits deteriorating convergence with standard solvers as the time step decreases. To address this issue, we investigate two tailored strategies: deflated Conjugate Gradient, which mitigates the effect of the most problematic eigenmodes, and collective Block-Jacobi, which exploits the block structure of the system matrix. Numerical experiments show that both approaches yield iteration counts effectively independent of $Δt$, ensuring robust performance with respect to the time step. Future work will focus on extending this robustness to the spatial discretisation parameter $h$ by integrating multigrid strategies with the time-robust solvers developed in this study."}

Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all. While the latter does not settle an open question, it strikes us as important to bring to attention, given the interest in finding a solution to Fox's conjecture."}

Existing approaches lack systematic tools for enforcing such constraints while retaining full modeling flexibility. This paper introduces a new representation for univariate probability measures based on discrete sequential barycenter arrays (SBA). We study structural properties of SBA representations and establish new approximation results. In particular, we show that for any target distribution, its SBA-based discrete approximations converge in both the weak topology and in Wasserstein distances, and that the representation is exact for all distributions with finite discrete support. We further characterize a broad class of measures whose SBA partitions exhibit regularity and induce increasingly fine meshes, and we prove that this class is dense in standard probabilistic topologies. These theoretical results enable the construction of probability models that preserve prescribed values -- or full distributions -- of the mean while maintaining large support. As an application, we derive a mixture model for density estimation whose induced mixing distribution has a fixed or user-specified mean. The resulting framework provides a principled mechanism for incorporating mean constraints in nonparametric modeling while preserving strong approximation properties. The approach is illustrated using both simulated and real data."}

We focus on the practical realization of this iterative approach, leveraging sum-factorization and explicit SIMD vectorization to minimize memory footprint and maximize arithmetic throughput. The performance analysis demonstrates that the solver effectively hides data-fetching latencies and maintains optimal $\\mathcal{O}(p^d)$ memory scaling, even when dominated by geometric data on distorted meshes.

While traditional models, such as linear, power, and exponential demand functions, offer analytical convenience, they often fail to capture realistic purchase dynamics, leading to suboptimal pricing. The logit demand function addresses these limitations through its bounded, S-shaped curve, offering a more realistic representation of consumer behavior. Despite its advantages, most existing literature relies on heuristic approaches, such as pricing at the inflection point, which prioritizes maximum price sensitivity but does not guarantee maximum revenue. This study proposes a novel, exact pricing algorithm that analytically derives the revenue-maximizing price under the logit demand function using the Lambert W function. By providing a closed-form solution, the approach eliminates reliance on heuristic iterative methods and corrects the common practice of considering the inflection point price as market price. In fact, we demonstrate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price under reasonable assumptions, leading to lower prices for consumers and higher revenue for sellers. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed algorithm and examine the changes in the optimality gap as demand function parameters vary. Results indicate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price, with an average 20% price reduction accompanied by a 15% increase in revenue."}

In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.\n  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.\n  As an application we show that the Möbius energy introduced by O'Hara~\\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic.

However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings."}

However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations.

However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining.

To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.\n  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.\n  As an application we show that the Möbius energy introduced by O'Hara~\\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the Möbius energy."}

While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some, quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, Mészáros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán (2024). Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juhász, and Kálmán's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all.

From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\\widehatΩ_Λ}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})/\\widehatΩ_Λ}\\,=\\,\\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${Ω_Λ(\\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy."}

Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative \"chain rules\" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals."}

By jointly accounting for imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rate, which are key limited factors in practical systems, we aim to design scheduling algorithms to optimize the age of information (AoI) over the infinite time horizon. For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies."}

However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance."}

Building on this result, we obtain the first quantitative bounds in the Wasserstein distance for a variety of moving-measure models initialized by Poisson-driven clouds of points, turning qualitative central limit theorems into explicit rates of convergence. The scope of the approach is then demonstrated through several examples, including systems driven by fractional Brownian motion, $α$-stable processes, uniformly elliptic diffusions, and spectral empirical measures arising from Dyson Brownian motion, all under broad assumptions on the control measure of the initial Poisson configuration.

The typical formulation of these models are based on Markov processes for which there is extensive research on efficient simulation and inference. However, there are biological processes, such as gene transcription and translation, that introduce history dependent dynamics requiring non-Markovian processes to accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the system. This greater realism comes with additional computational challenges for simulation and parameter inference. We develop efficient stochastic simulation algorithms for well-mixed non-Markovian stochastic biochemical reaction networks with delays that depend on system state and time. Our methods generalize the next reaction method and $τ$-leaping method to support arbitrary inter-event time distributions while preserving computational scalability. We also introduce a coupling scheme to generate exact non-Markovian sample paths that are positively correlated to an approximate non-Markovian $τ$-leaping sample path. This enables substantial computational gains for Bayesian inference of model parameters though multifidelity simulation-based inference schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a gene regulation model with delayed auto-inhibition, showing substantial gains in both simulation accuracy and inference efficiency of two orders of magnitude. These results extend the practical applicability of non-Markovian models in systems biology and beyond."}

These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras.

In this paper, we will consider a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an arbitrary relative degree $n$, and discuss the stability and design of extended PID controller (a natural extension of PID).

The 2RC model is applied to a set of twelve batteries using four publicly available datasets obtained from well-established research institutions. The methodology is structured in four stages: first, the 2RC model is selected due to its balance between physical interpretability and computational simplicity; second, experimental charge-discharge cycle data are collected; third, various optimization techniques are applied with the aim of minimizing the error between the experimental data and the response estimated by the model; and finally, accuracy is evaluated using the mean squared error, while computational efficiency is assessed through execution time. Traditional, metaheuristic, and bio-inspired optimization methods are considered, including least squares optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and several nature-inspired variants. It is demonstrated that bio-inspired techniques achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods, without a significant increase in computational cost. In particular, particle swarm optimization shows superior performance in terms of precision and robustness against local minima.

Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications", "summary": "Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems."}

We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function.

An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination.

Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology."}

This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance."}

The singular control is equivalently characterized as a pair of regions of time and the augmented states, called the singular control law. To encourage the exploration in the learning procedure, we propose a randomization method for the singular control laws, new to the literature, by considering an auxiliary singular control and entropy regularization. The exploratory singular control problem is formulated as a two-stage optimal control problem, where the time-inconsistency issue arises in the outer problem. In the specific model setup with known model coefficients, we provide the full characterization of the time-consistent equilibrium singular controls for the two-stage problem. Taking advantage of the solution structure, we can consider the proper parameterization of the randomized equilibrium policy and the value function when the model is unknown and further devise the actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. In the numerical experiment, we present the superior convergence of parameter iterations towards the true values based on the randomized equilibrium policy and illustrate how the exploration may advance the learning performance in the context of singular controls."}

Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moiré-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory."}

These reduce to the stationary log-Gamma, strict-weak, and Beta polymer in random environment in certain cases, allowing transfer of known results from integrable polymers to dimers with random weights. As an example application, we prove that the turning points at the boundaries of the Aztec diamond exhibit fluctuations of order $n^{2/3}$, in contrast to the $n^{1/2}$ fluctuations for deterministic weights.\n  Underlying all these is a key integrability property of the weights: they are the unique family for which independence is preserved under the shuffling algorithm."}

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments."}

However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms."}

We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds.

One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior.

While general non-zero-sum games are computationally hard, researchers focus on the special class of monotone games for gradient-based algorithms. However, there is a substantial gap between the gradient complexity of monotone zero-sum and monotone general-sum games. Moreover, in many practical scenarios of games the zero-sum assumption needs to be relaxed. To address these issues, we define a new intermediate class of monotone near-zero-sum games that contains monotone zero-sum games as a special case. Then, we present a novel algorithm that transforms the near-zero-sum games into a sequence of zero-sum subproblems, improving the gradient-based complexity for the class.

One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy.

However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches.

For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \\emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.\n  Our contribution is not optimality but \\emph{implementational simplicity} and an \\emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior."}

Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation. Empirical results confirm that our method consistently improves predictive accuracy over the Bayes filter baseline."}

We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise."}

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions."}
