The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.\n  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation. The analysis demonstrates optimal-order velocity convergence in both the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms and establishes optimal $H^1$-convergence and nearly optimal $L^2$-convergence of a post-processed pressure. Numerical experiments illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings."}

They typically accurately capture the mechanical properties of a material, while substantially reducing computational cost by avoiding full three-dimensional resolution. Applications include the simulation of fiber-based materials, porous media, and biological systems such as vascular networks. This article focuses on two representative problems: a stationary formulation describing the elastic deformation of beam networks, and a time-dependent formulation modeling elastic wave propagation in such materials. We propose a two-level additive domain decomposition method to efficiently solve the linear system associated with the stationary problem, as well as the linear systems that arise at each time step of the time-dependent problem through implicit time discretization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the domain decomposition method when used as a preconditioner, quantifying the convergence rate with respect to network connectivity and heterogeneity. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the mechanical properties of commercial-grade paperboard."}

Keywords: elasticity, microstructure, incompatible, two-well problems, scaling laws", "summary": "In this article, we study scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data in settings where the wells and/or the boundary data are incompatible. Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $ε$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $ε^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $ε^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $ε^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting."}

In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.\n  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.\n  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory.

In this paper, we rigorously establish this equivalence by constructing a continuous family of unitaries that bridges the discrete algebraic teleportation protocol and modular flow. We resolve the obstruction of dynamic idempotency, inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path whose unique self-adjoint generator $\\tilde{G}$ is proven to be exactly twice the modular Hamiltonian difference, $\\tilde{G}=2(K_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{M}}}-K_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{N}}})$. We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via Kosaki's non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Our results provide a concrete analytic mechanism for probing emergent geometry from quantum information, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction."}

Privacy is characterized by the $(ε, δ)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(ε, δ)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(ε, δ)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $ε$-hyperedge DP where $δ=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism."}

Shortly after, they were defined and studied intrinsically by Effros and Ruan, and by this author. In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.\n  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.\n  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory. On the other hand however, we have tried to make these notes highly self-contained.

We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation.

Associated code and data available at https://github.com/Armen0807", "summary": "We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point ω_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to ω_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts."}

However, existing research often focuses narrowly on isolated domains, such as point-cloud geometry or energy analytics, without providing a scalable and interoperable workflow that integrates building geometry, equipment metadata, and operational data into a unified FM platform. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for scalable digital-twin deployment in smart campus buildings by integrating 3D laser scanning, BIM modeling, and IoT-enabled data visualization to support facility operations and maintenance. The methodology includes: (1) reality capture using terrestrial laser scanning and structured point-cloud processing; (2) development of an enriched BIM model incorporating architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, conveying, and sensor systems; and (3) creation of a digital-twin environment that links equipment metadata, maintenance policies, and simulated IoT data within a digital-twin management platform. A case study of the Price Gilbert Building at Georgia Tech demonstrates the implementation of this workflow. A total of 509 equipment items were modeled and embedded with OmniClass classifications into the digital twin. Ten interactive dashboards were developed to visualize system performance. Results show that the proposed framework enables centralized asset documentation, improved system visibility, and enhanced preventive and reactive maintenance workflows. Although most IoT data were simulated due to limited existing sensor infrastructure, the prototype validates the feasibility of a scalable digital twin for facility management and establishes a reference model for real-time monitoring, analytics integration, and future autonomous building operations."}

Associated code and data available at https://github.com/Armen0807", "summary": "We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point ω_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to ω_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts."}

Via their representation as string diagrams, monoidal theories provide a graphical syntax with a visually intuitive notions of information flow and composition. Layered monoidal theories allow mixing several monoidal theories (together with translations between them) within the same string diagram, while retaining mathematical precision and semantic interpretability. We define three flavours of layered monoidal theories, provide a recursively generated syntax for each, and construct a free-forgetful adjunction with respect to three closely related semantics: opfibrations, fibrations and deflations. We motivate the general theory by providing several examples from existing literature.\n  In the second part, we develop a formal approach to retrosynthesis - the process of backwards reaction search in synthetic chemistry. Chemical processes are treated at three levels of abstraction: (1) (formal) reactions encode all chemically feasible combinatorial rearrangements of molecules, (2) reaction schemes encode transformations applicable to 'patches' of molecules (including the functional groups), and (3) disconnection rules encode local chemical rewrite rules applicable to a single bond or atom at a time. We show that the three levels are tightly linked: the reactions are generated by the reaction schemes, while there is a functorial translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions. Moreover, the translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions is shown to be sound, complete and universal - allowing one to treat the disconnection rules as a formal syntax with the semantics provided by the reactions. We tie together the two parts by providing a formalisation of retrosynthesis within a certain layered monoidal theory."}

Associated code and data available at https://github.com/Armen0807", "summary": "We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point ω_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to ω_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts."}

Directly fine-tuning LAMs for adaptation is often impractical due to prohibitive training costs, low inference efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, in addition to the limited accessibility of model parameters. To address these limitations, we establish a collaborative framework for air interface. In this framework, unlike prior approaches that either depend solely on LAMs or require direct fine-tuning, LAMs are exploited as a universal channel knowledge base while small artificial intelligence models (SAMs) are employed as lightweight plugins to capture environment-specific knowledge, facilitating efficient environment-specific adaptation of LAMs. Subsequently, we instantiate this framework for CSI feedback tasks, and develop a large and small collaboration framework for CSI feedback, referred to as LASCO. LASCO operates by letting the base LAM produce an initial CSI reconstruction, learning the environment-induced reconstruction shift through a reference SAM and a proxy SAM, and transferring this shift back to the LAM. To further enhance adaptability, we introduce elastic-LASCO (E-LASCO), which augments LASCO with learnable collaboration coefficients that control the contribution of LAMs and SAMs across different environments. Numerical results demonstrate that LASCO and E-LASCO enables LAMs to achieve environment-specific performance gains with significantly reduced training costs, lower data collection requirements, and faster adaptation speed."}

Parallel to this, the empty set is analyzed not as a void, but as an existing axiomatic object that serves as the foundation for constructing the number system in modern set theory. Furthermore, the operational utility of active nothing is demonstrated through its role in algebraic manipulation -- such as adding zero to reveal structure -- and in physical conservation laws. Finally, drawing on the philosophy of Nikolaus von Kues and the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, the paper interprets mathematics as a free, creative act of the human mind emerging ex nihilo."}

These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint."}

Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations."}

We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps.

Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations.

Our main contribution is a Spectral Equivariance Theorem showing that the eigenfunctions of any transported kernel are obtained by unitary transport of the base eigenfunctions. As a consequence, orthogonal polynomial estimators are equivariant under geometric deformation, kernel estimators correspond to soft spectral filtering in a twin space, and minimax rates and bias--variance tradeoffs are invariant under transport.

In the high-dimensional setting where the number of functional variables is large relative to the length of functional time series, non-asymptotic theory for covariance function estimation has been developed for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian functional linear processes. However, corresponding non-asymptotic results for high-dimensional non-Gaussian and nonlinear functional time series, as well as for spectral density function estimation, are largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce novel functional dependence measures, based on which we establish systematic non-asymptotic concentration bounds for estimates of (auto)covariance and spectral density functions in high-dimensional and non-Gaussian settings. We then illustrate the usefulness of our convergence results through two applications to dynamic functional principal component analysis and sparse spectral density function estimation. To handle the practical scenario where curves are discretely observed with errors, we further develop convergence rates of the corresponding estimates obtained via a nonparametric smoothing method. Finally, extensive simulation studies are conducted to corroborate our theoretical findings."}

We derive precise spectral properties of the associated linearized operators and prove a Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion that completely characterizes spectral stability.

We operate in the high-dimensional and highly-constrained setting, where oracle access is restricted to one or a few objective and constraint gradients per-iteration, as in streaming or online estimation. Existing approaches to solve such problems are based on either the stochastic primal-dual or stochastic subgradient methods, and require globally Lipschitz continuous constraint functions. In this work, we develop a hinge-proximal framework that utilizes an exact penalty reformulation to yield updates involving only one linearized constraint (and hence accessing one constraint gradient) per-iteration. The updates also admit a novel hinge-proximal three-point inequality relying on smoothness rather than global Lipschitz continuity of the constraint functions. The framework leads to three algorithms: a baseline hinge-proximal SGD (HPS), a variance-reduced HPS version for finite-sum settings, and a nested HPS version whose performance depends on a geometric regularity constant of the constraint region rather than explicitly on the number of constraints, while achieving near-SGD sample complexity. The superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a robust regression problem with noisy features, representative of errors-in-variables estimation."}

In this paper, we use the $L^2$ norm and the three-dimensional generalization of the Kac Model to prove a bound whose long-term behavior scales with $M/N$."}

We construct moduli stacks parametrizing diagrams of bundles with $λ$--connections over a base prestack $X$, where $λ$ can be a fixed number or a parameter. Taking $λ$ to be $1$ gives a moduli stack parametrizing diagrams of bundles with connection, while taking it to be a parameter gives a version of Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge filtration for digrams of bundles with connection.

Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure. Further, we provide quantifying measures that capture the strength and nature of causal effects on events, and show that we can recover the common measures of treatment effect as special cases."}

Traditional communication paradigms centered on accuracy, throughput, and latency are increasingly inadequate for these systems, where the value of information depends on its semantic relevance to a specific task. This paper provides a unified exposition of the progression from classical distortion-based frameworks, through information freshness metrics such as the Age of Information (AoI) and its variants, to the emerging paradigm of goal-oriented semantics-aware communication. We organize and systematize existing semantics-aware metrics, including content- and version-aware measures, context-dependent distortion formulations, and history-dependent error persistence metrics that capture lasting impact and urgency. Within this framework, we highlight how these metrics address the limitations of purely accuracy- or freshness-centric designs, and how they collectively enable the selective generation and transmission of only task-relevant information. We further review analytical tools based on Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization methods that have been employed to characterize optimal or near-optimal timing and scheduling policies under semantic performance criteria and communication constraints. By synthesizing these developments into a coherent framework, the paper clarifies the design principles underlying goal-oriented, semantics-aware communication systems. It illustrates how they can significantly improve efficiency, reliability, and task performance. The presented perspective aims to serve as a bridge between information-theoretic, control-theoretic, and networking viewpoints, and to guide the design of semantic communication architectures for 6G and beyond."}

By developing a unified framework that bridges classical monotone operator theory with contemporary computational challenges, this work provides essential mathematical foundations for the robust numerical approximation and sensitivity analysis of quasi-variational problems arising in materials science, physics, and engineering applications."}

The study introduces the concept of an AI capacity budget to quantify how the finite ability of a learning model constrains joint communication and sensing performance. Under this framework, the paper derives both converse (upper) and achievability (lower) bounds that define the achievable rate-sensing region. For Gaussian channels, the effect of limited learning capacity is shown to behave as an equivalent additive noise, allowing simple analytical expressions for the resulting communication rate and sensing distortion. The theory is then extended to Rayleigh and Rician fading as well as to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems through new matrix inequalities and a constructive mapping between AI capacity and effective noise covariance. Resource allocation between sensing and communication is optimized under this learning constraint, yielding closed-form conditions in the Gaussian case. A general learning-information trade-off law is also established, linking the representational power of the learning module to the achievable performance frontier. Finally, a practical variational training procedure is proposed to enforce the capacity constraint and to guide empirical evaluation. The derived scaling laws provide quantitative insight for co-designing model size, waveform, and hardware in next-generation ISAC systems."}

A graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, which is an acyclic orientation such that for any directed path $v_0 \\rightarrow v_1 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow v_m$ with $m \\ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \\le i < j \\le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$.

However, not all split graphs are semi-transitive, and the characterization of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for semi-transitive split graphs remains an open problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new matrix property called the $I$-circular property, which is closely related to the well-known $D$-circular property introduced by Safe. The $I$-circular property requires that both the rows of a matrix and the pairwise intersections of rows form circular intervals under some linear ordering of the columns. Using this property, we establish a direct connection between the structure of semi-transitive split graphs and the matrix representation of their adjacency relationships.

The factor D2 vanishes precisely when v1 and v2 have the same norm and are orthogonal as vectors in R^8, giving a concrete polynomial criterion for nontrivial zero divisors. After normalizing by the norm, the zero divisor set becomes diffeomorphic to the Stiefel manifold V2(R^8) of orthonormal 2-frames, which we interpret as a \"zero divisor frame bundle\". On a suitable 3-dimensional linear slice, this set is modeled by a quadratic double cone, a structure we confirm by numerical experiments and 3-dimensional visualization.

We introduce a general debiasing framework, Debiased Profile M-Estimation (DPME), which applies to a broad class of models and does not require model-specific Neyman orthogonalization or projection derivations as in existing methods. Our approach begins by obtaining an initial estimator of the parameters by optimizing a penalized objective function. To correct for the bias introduced by penalization, we construct a one-step estimator using the Newton-Raphson update, applied to the gradient of a profile function defined as the optimal objective function with the parameter of interest held fixed. We use numerical differentiation without requiring the explicit calculation of the gradients. The resulting DPME estimator is shown to be asymptotically linear and normally distributed. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better coverage rates than existing alternatives, with largely reduced computational cost. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our method with an application to estimating a treatment rule for multiple myeloma."}

We present two perturbation approaches to solve the nonlinear, dispersive and non-autonomous differential equations of the model and compare the solutions with numerical simulations of the original system of equations. In the approximation for small periodic corrugations we built the solutions as modulated traveling waves using Fourier series. The coefficients of the series are solved using the Green function method and the pathordered exponential method. At the second order in the relative height of bed corrugations, we obtain the perturbation as the fourth-order linear dispersive waves generated by the modulated traveling soliton in its wake. In the second approach, we rewrite the Boussinesq system into a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) nonlinear equation, and obtain the corresponding perturbed solitons. These analytic solutions are compared with the results of numerical simulations, for various parameters that characterize the effects of nonlinearity, dispersion, and bottom bathymetry.

We investigate the structure of $T^1_X$ for singular varieties and provide cohomological and geometric criteria ensuring non-rigidity.

We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = Π$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice. We also illustrate the results on discrete uniform and multimodal examples, including the Curie-Weiss model where $GPG$ achieves polynomial (in inverse temperature and dimension) mixing while Glauber dynamics remains exponentially slow."}

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln[2\\cos(π/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T \\to 0) = \\ln 2$."}

The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws."}

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

A subset $D \\subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \\in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \\cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\\vert (N_G[u] \\cup N_G[v]) \\cap D\\vert \\geq 1$.

The \\textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs.

Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n).

Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum.

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime."}

However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower."}

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed.

The transformation yields a new process whose diffusion component has a square-root structure and whose drift becomes nonlinear.

To address this, we introduce a generalized Girsanov change of measure that adjusts the drift of the transformed process. Under the resulting equivalent measure, the dynamics reduce to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Using the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, and show that the combined transformation and measure change is valid only under specific parameter restrictions, including those most relevant for financial applications. The CIR representation allows us to exploit known results on stationary distributions, moments, and boundary behavior. Under an additional coefficient relationship, the process can be further linked to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework, yielding explicit distributional properties under the equivalent measure.

This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models. Our findings clarify how likelihood-based losses and model implementation jointly determine the feasibility of interpolation and show that overfitting should not be regarded as benign for survival models. All theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments that highlight the distinct generalization behaviors of survival models."}

The transformation yields a new process whose diffusion component has a square-root structure and whose drift becomes nonlinear. A critical reassessment of earlier studies using similar transformations reveals fundamental errors in model specification and derivations. To address this, we introduce a generalized Girsanov change of measure that adjusts the drift of the transformed process. Under the resulting equivalent measure, the dynamics reduce to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Using the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, and show that the combined transformation and measure change is valid only under specific parameter restrictions, including those most relevant for financial applications. The CIR representation allows us to exploit known results on stationary distributions, moments, and boundary behavior. Under an additional coefficient relationship, the process can be further linked to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework, yielding explicit distributional properties under the equivalent measure. Finally, since standard martingale conditions are not applicable, we prove directly that the associated Radon-Nikodym derivative is a true martingale by invoking a recent criterion based on Feller's explosion test and boundary classification."}

Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime."}

We propose a \\emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional.

Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving such problems, while Physics informed Kolmogorov Arnold networks (PIKANs) represent a recent benchmark that, in certain problems, promises greater interpretability and accuracy compared to PINNs, due to their nature, being constructed as a composition of polynomials. In this work, we develop a methodology for addressing inverse problems in infinite and semi infinite domains. We introduce a novel sampling strategy for the network's training points, using the negative exponential and normal distributions, alongside a dual network architecture that is trained to learn the solution and parameters of an equation with the same loss function. This design enables the solution of inverse problems without explicitly imposing boundary conditions, as long as the solutions tend to stabilize when leaving the domain of interest. The proposed architecture is implemented using both PINNs and PIKANs, and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy with respect to a known solution as well as computational time and response to a noisy environment. Our results demonstrate that, in this setting, PINNs provide a more accurate and computationally efficient solution, solving the inverse problem 1,000 times faster and in the same order of magnitude, yet with a lower relative error than PIKANs."}

Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks. Moreover, the refined value-of-recall metric demonstrates that strategic forgetting can bolster resilience by balancing network robustness and adaptability. The findings underscore the critical importance of aligning memory and similarity parameters with the structural and adversarial dynamics of the network. By quantifying the tangible benefits of incorporating memory constraints into homophily-based analyses, this study offers actionable insights for optimizing real-world applications, including social systems, collaborative platforms, and cybersecurity contexts."}

An ab initio derivation of a regression method is proposed, starting from postulates of indifference. It is shown that if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme, including the kernel form, the type of regularization, and the noise parameterization, follows analytically from these postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle.

A standard approach of mixture modeling is to assume that the mixture component takes a parametric kernel form, while the flexibility of the model can be obtained by using a large or possibly unbounded number of such parametric kernels. In many applications, making parametric assumptions on the latent subpopulation distributions may be unrealistic, which motivates the need for nonparametric modeling of the mixture components themselves. In this paper we study finite mixtures with nonparametric mixture components, using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach. In particular, it is assumed that the data population is generated according to a finite mixture of latent component distributions, where each component is endowed with a Bayesian nonparametric prior such as the Dirichlet process mixture. We present conditions under which the individual mixture component's distributions can be identified, and establish posterior contraction behavior for the data population's density, as well as densities of the latent mixture components. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate via simulation studies and real-world data illustrations that it is possible to efficiently learn complex distributions for the latent subpopulations. In theory, the posterior contraction rate of the component densities is nearly polynomial, which is a significant improvement over the logarithm convergence rate of estimating mixing measures via deconvolution."}

To confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers). The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers."}

This paper introduces a rigorous mathematical methodology for task assignment, employing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to ensure both balanced workloads and cost minimization. The proposed model systematically integrates individual employee efficiency, task complexity, and performance metrics to reflect real organizational dynamics. The formulation is guided by two principal objectives: firstly, to achieve equitable work load distribution commensurate with employee efficiency, and secondly, to minimize overall project costs by accounting for task difficulty and individual proficiency. Furthermore, the approach incorporates adaptive updates to efficiency parameters based on observed performance, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Empirical evaluation using simulated datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over conventional assignment strategies in terms of both workload fairness and cost reduction. The findings underscore the potential of this MILP based framework as a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for contemporary human resource allocation challenges in project management contexts."}

The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP. The neural network then trains to encode spatial density information, allowing the storage of network parameters and learnable latent vectors. To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations.

DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors.

By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically.

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting."}

The architecture consists of transceiver IQ skew estimation methods and a low-complexity MIMO equalizer structure. Before the IQ skew estimation, the chromatic dispersion(CD) is pre-compensated in the transmitter(TX) by chirp filtering. The receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO(CV-MIMO) and a real-valued DD-LMS MIMO(RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing. The RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarisations and simultaneously compensates for the TX IQ imbalance. The architecture first compensates for the IQ skew at low-complexity, and the other imperfections are compensated by the low-complexity MIMO equalizer. Therefore, this architecture can equalize signals impaired by the transceiver IQ imbalance with low complexity. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation(DP-QAM) signals and offline DSP showed that, with the RX IQ skew estimation, the number of real multiplications is reduced by more than 70% compared with conventional cases. With the low-complexity MIMO equalizer, the number of real multiplications is reduced by 51% compared with 4x4 MIMO"}

When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized.

Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point ω_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to ω_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts."}

In 2018, the concept of forts was introduced to provide a set covering characterization of zero forcing sets.

In 2025, researchers explored the combinatorial question of how many minimal forts a graph can have. They demonstrated that the number of minimal forts in a graph with an order of at least six is strictly less than Sperner's bound. Moreover, the authors derived an explicit formula for the number of minimal forts in path, cycle, and spider graphs. For example, the number of minimal forts in a path graph aligns with the Padovan sequence, and thus exhibits exponential growth. In this article, we demonstrate that no tree with an order of $n$ can have fewer than $n/3$ minimal forts. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the trees that possess exactly $n/3$ minimal forts. We conjecture that the $n/3$ bound is valid for all graphs of order $n$.

Associated code and data available at https://github.com/Armen0807", "summary": "We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point ω_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to ω_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts."}

Due to the distributed and noncooperative nature of the game, some curious agents may wish to steal sensitive information from neighboring agents during parameter exchanges. Additionally, communication delays arising from network congestion, particularly in wireless settings, as well as feedback delays, can hinder the convergence of agents to a Nash equilibrium. Although a recent work addressed both communication and feedback delays in aggregative games, it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the delays are fixed over time and identical across agents. Hence, the case of time-varying and non-identical delays across agents has never been considered in aggregative games. In this work, we address the combined challenges of privacy leakage with time-varying and non-identical communication and feedback delays for the first time. We propose an online distributed dual averaging algorithm that simultaneously tackles these challenges while achieving a provably low regret bound.

As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem."}

Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation."}

AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance.

In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of simple extensions in the linear setting.

While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object."}

Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP."}

This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{α,p}(Γ)$ and $H^α(Γ)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into Hölder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(κ^2-Δ_Γ)$ and $(κ^2-\\nabla(a\\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers).

Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation."}

Small-scale prototype tests of CABLESSail are presented in this paper, which demonstrate the effectiveness of cable actuation on deployable booms. A novel control allocation method is also presented in this paper that provides a computationally-efficient manner to determine the deformations required in each of the structural booms to impart the desired momentum management torque on the solar sail. Numerical simulation results with the proposed algorithm demonstrate robustness to uncertainty in the shape of the sail membrane, resulting in reliable generation of momentum management torques that exceed or meet the capabilities of state-of-the-art solar sail actuators.

Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids."}

Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments.

Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps.

Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and Rényi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing Rényi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours."}

We lift the existence of (approximate) polynomial kernels for $\\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION by the solution size to (approximate) polynomial kernels parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to graphs of bounded elimination distance to $\\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. This results in exact polynomial kernels for every family $\\mathcal{F}$ that contains a planar graph, and an approximate polynomial kernel for PLANAR VERTEX DELETION. Moreover, combining our result with a previous lower bound, we obtain the following infinite set of dichotomies, assuming $NP \\not\\subseteq coNP/poly$: for any finite set $\\mathcal{F}$ of biconnected graphs on at least three vertices containing a planar graph, and any minor-closed class of graphs $\\mathcal{C}$, $\\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION admits a polynomial kernel parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to $\\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $\\mathcal{C}$ has bounded elimination distance to $\\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. For instance, this yields dichotomies for CACTUS VERTEX DELETION, OUTERPLANAR VERTEX DELETION, and TREEWIDTH-$t$ VERTEX DELETION for every integer $t \\geq 0$. Prior to our work, such dichotomies were only known for the particular cases of VERTEX COVER and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. Our approach builds on the techniques developed by Jansen and Pieterse [Theor.

These algorithms are motivated by big-data settings where very large problem instances must be solved, and using poly(n) memory is prohibitively expensive.

Banana curves are reducible rational curves obtained as a degeneration of hyperelliptic curves. In this work, we relate the family of KP multi-solitons arising from banana curves together with non-special divisors of fixed degree to the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor of the curve. We describe the Voronoi and Delaunay polytopes and show that the latter are combinatorially equivalent to uniform matroid polytopes. As a consequence, the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor canonically encodes the matroid and Grassmannian structures underlying the associated KP multi-soliton solutions. We define the Hirota variety of a banana graph, which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a graph. Starting from the matroid arising from Delaunay polytopes and the periods in the tropical limit, we construct an explicit parametrization of this variety which realizes the tau function as a multi-soliton. Our framework specializes naturally to real and positive settings."}

By training a transformer to predict the minimum Hamming distance of a class of linear codes and pairing it with a genetic algorithm over the search space, we develop a novel method for discovering champion codes. This model effectively reduces the search space of linear codes needed to achieve champion codes. Our results present the use of this method in the study and construction of error-correcting codes, applicable to codes such as generalised toric, Reed-Muller, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, algebrogeometric, and potentially quantum codes."}

Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target."}

Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?"}
