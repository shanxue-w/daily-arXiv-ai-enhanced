This leads to a compromise where the excellent performance\ncharacteristics of hierarchical hybrid grids can be maintained at the price\nthat the flexibility of generating locally refined meshes is constrained.\nFurthermore, mesh adaptivity often relies on a posteriori error estimators or\nerror indicators that tend to become computationally expensive. Again with the\ngoal of preserving scalability and performance, a method is proposed that\nleverages the grid hierarchy and the full multigrid scheme that generates a\nnatural sequence of approximations on the nested hierarchy of grids.

Recent work by Kadekodi et al.\ndemonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can\nlead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such\nadaptations, known as \\emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of\n\\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes\nof different parameters.\n  In this work, we study the setting in which $\\lambda$ codewords of an initial\n$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a\nfinal $[n^F = \\lambda k^I + r^F,\\, k^F = \\lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by\npresenting three constructions that achieve optimal \\emph{access cost}, defined\nas the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first\ntwo constructions apply when $\\lambda \\leq r^I$ and impose specific\ndivisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize\nboth the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which\nbuilds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting\narbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that\nare linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction\nachieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS\nconjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that\noptimizes the \\emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols\ntransmitted during conversion.

Weighted model\ncounting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic\nreasoning and quantitative risk assessment.\n  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)\nconverting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,\nusing multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing\nthis evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,\nand it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational\narithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.\n  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to\nefficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a\nuser-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the\nprecision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be\ntightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision\nrepresentation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range\ndouble (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in\nweighted model counting. For problems with mixed negative and positive weights,\nwe show that a combination of interval floating-point arithmetic and rational\narithmetic can achieve the twin goals of efficiency and guaranteed precision.\nFor our evaluations, we have devised especially challenging formulas and weight\nassignments, demonstrating the robustness of our approach."}

Given a positive\ninteger $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$\nin which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored.\nThese partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic\npartitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist\nin the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers,\nand Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various\n$d \\geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this\npaper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More\nspecifically, our main theorem asserts \\[a_3\\left(5^{2\\alpha}n +\\gamma_{\\alpha}\n\\right) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5^\\alpha},\\] where \\[\\gamma_{\\alpha} = 20 + \\frac{19\n\\cdot 25 (25^{\\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.\\] In order to prove these congruences, we use\nan approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson\nand Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$.\nHowever, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our\nmodular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we\nutilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot,\nwhich is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular\ncurves, such as $X_0(10).$"}

Recently, the disaggregated integer L-shaped (DL-shaped) method,\nwhich decomposes the recourse function by customer rather than treating it as\nan aggregate cost, has been proposed and successfully applied under the\ndetour-to-depot recourse policy. However, the validity of this new approach and\nits generalizability to other policies have not been thoroughly investigated.\nIn this work, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity\nof the DL-shaped method, namely, the superadditivity of the recourse function\nunder concatenation. We demonstrate that the optimal restocking policy\nsatisfies this superadditivity property. Moreover, we rectify an incorrect\nargument from the original paper on the DL-shaped method to rigorously\nestablish its validity under the detour-to-depot policy. We then develop a\nDL-shaped algorithm tailored to the optimal restocking policy. Our algorithm\nexploits new dynamic programming-based lower bounds on the optimal restocking\nrecourse function. We also introduce new valid inequalities that generalize the\noriginal DL-shaped cuts and speed up computations by an order of magnitude.\nComputational experiments show that our DL-shaped algorithm significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art integer L-shaped algorithm from the\nliterature. We solve several open instances to optimality, including 14\nsingle-vehicle instances, which constitute the most challenging variant of the\nproblem."}

Central to our method is the construction\nof a G-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over the conjugation orbit of a\none-parameter subgroup (1-PS), whose fibres are precisely the negative weight\nspaces determining instability.

This avoids ill-conditioned systems from monolithic\nsolving due to high contrast and interface jumps. Both energy estimate and\nFourier analysis are used to prove the convergence of this algorithm when the\nstandard Robin condition is applied to transmit information between subdomains.\nTo achieve fast convergence, instead of the standard Robin, the scaled Robin\ntransmission condition is proposed, and the involved free parameter is\nrigorously optimized. The results reveal several new findings due to the\npresence of TCR: first, the larger the TCR, the faster the OSM converges;\nsecond, mesh-independent convergence is achieved in the asymptotic sense, in\ncontrast to the mesh-dependent results without TCR; and last, the heterogeneity\ncontrast benefits the convergence, with a larger contrast leading to faster\nconvergence.

This suggest a natural way of associating to any\nclass $\\mathcal{G}$ of unweighted graphs a corresponding class of edge-weighted\ngraphs, namely by requiring that all level graphs belong to $\\mathcal{G}$. We\nshow that weighted graphs for which all level graphs are split, threshold, or\nchain graphs can be recognized in linear time using special edge elimination\norderings. We obtain these results by introducing the notion of degree sandwich\nmonotone graph classes. A graph class $\\mathcal{G}$ is sandwich monotone if\nevery edge set which may be removed from a graph in $\\mathcal{G}$ without\nleaving the class also contains a single edge that can be safely removed.\nFurthermore, if we require the safe edge to fulfill a certain degree property,\nthen $\\mathcal{G}$ is called degree sandwich monotone. We present necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a linear-time recognition algorithm\nfor any weighted graph class whose corresponding unweighted class is degree\nsandwich monotone and contains all edgeless graphs."}

For positive initial data, we prove that\nthe trivial ground state is globally asymptotically stable if the edges of the\nmetric graph are uniformly small and the nontrivial ground state is globally\nasymptotically stable if the edges are uniformly large. For the intermediate\ncase, we find a sharp criterion for the existence, uniqueness and global\nasymptotic stability of the trivial versus nontrivial ground state. Besides\nstandard methods based on the comparison theory, energy minimizers, and the\nlowest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, we develop a novel method based on\nthe period function for differential equations to characterize the nontrivial\nground state in the particular case of flower graphs."}
