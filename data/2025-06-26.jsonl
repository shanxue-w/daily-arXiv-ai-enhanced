Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our\nmodel also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion\nto ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio\nenvironments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric\nthat better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.\nExperimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,\nDiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable\nperformance under dynamic channels.

Our main result describes a novel phenomenon: in this statistical model\nand in an appropriate asymptotic regime, the behavior of any local minimum of\nthe nonconvex factorized approach (with known rank) is approximately equivalent\nto that of the matrix hard-thresholding of a corresponding matrix denoising\nproblem, and the behavior of the convex nuclear-norm regularized least squares\napproach is approximately equivalent to that of matrix soft-thresholding of the\nsame matrix denoising problem. Here \"approximately equivalent\" is understood in\nthe sense of concentration of Lipchitz functions. As a consequence, the\nnonconvex procedure uniformly dominates the convex approach in mean squared\nerror. Our arguments are based on a matrix operator generalization of the\nConvex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) together with studying the interplay\nbetween local minima of the convex and nonconvex formulations and their\n\"debiased\" counterparts, and several of these results may be of independent\ninterest."}

Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are\nconstructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue\nthat plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of\nthe standard integral representation which has been used since the birth of the\nform factor bootstrap program. Their asymptotics is characterized by\nexponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form\nfactors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the\ncancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption\nthat the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation,\nremain unchanged in the presence of $T \\bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong.\nThere is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and\nasymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor\nequations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor\nequations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are\nessential assumptions."}

We establish different sets of conditions that ensure existence,\nfiniteness, boundedness, and non-degeneracy of critical points of $F$ on\n$V_{\\xi}$, respectively. These lead to new conditions for the existence,\nconvergence, and smoothness of central paths of polynomial optimization and its\nextension to non-linear optimization problems involving definable sets and\nfunctions in an o-minimal structure.

Because quantum systems of a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom are not local, reflection positivity is not as restrictive as it is in\na local field theory. The motivation for the Euclidean approach is that it is\nstraightforward to construct exactly Poincar\\'e invariant quantum models of\nfinite number of degrees of freedom systems that satisfy cluster properties and\na spectral condition. In addition the quantum mechanical inner product can be\ncomputed without requiring an analytic continuation. Whether these\ndistributions can be generated by a dynamical principle remains to be\ndetermined, but understanding the general structure of the Euclidean covariant\ndistributions is an important first step."}

A number of existing works have studied both convex and nonconvex\napproaches to this problem, establishing minimax error rates when the number of\nmeasurements is sufficiently large relative to the rank and dimension of the\nlow-rank matrix, though a precise comparison of these procedures still remains\nunexplored. In this work we provide a high-dimensional statistical analysis for\nsymmetric low-rank matrix sensing observed under Gaussian measurements and\nnoise. Our main result describes a novel phenomenon: in this statistical model\nand in an appropriate asymptotic regime, the behavior of any local minimum of\nthe nonconvex factorized approach (with known rank) is approximately equivalent\nto that of the matrix hard-thresholding of a corresponding matrix denoising\nproblem, and the behavior of the convex nuclear-norm regularized least squares\napproach is approximately equivalent to that of matrix soft-thresholding of the\nsame matrix denoising problem. Here \"approximately equivalent\" is understood in\nthe sense of concentration of Lipchitz functions. As a consequence, the\nnonconvex procedure uniformly dominates the convex approach in mean squared\nerror. Our arguments are based on a matrix operator generalization of the\nConvex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) together with studying the interplay\nbetween local minima of the convex and nonconvex formulations and their\n\"debiased\" counterparts, and several of these results may be of independent\ninterest."}

The combinatorics of correlation functions is\nan interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions.\nThis is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher\ndimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets.\nWe provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural\nextension of the \"shaving\" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a\nbyproduct, we also define \"graph correlahedra\" as polytopes for the\ncontribution to correlators from any fixed graph.
