Training a NN\nas a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution\nfunction that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding\noptimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that\nsolutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the\nparameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model\nmp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise\nlinear behaviour.

Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee\naccuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces\nexact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function.\nTo evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow\nproblems in electricity management.

We\nshow that the intrinsic and dual volumes of the sublevel set $[f \\le 1]$ admit\nLaplace-type integral formulas obtained by averaging the infimal projection and\nrestriction of $f$ over the Grassmannian. This explicit representation yields\nthree main consequences: (1) L\\\"owner--John-type existence and uniqueness\nresults extending beyond the classical volume case; (2) a block decomposition\nprinciple describing factorization of intrinsic volumes under direct-sum\nsplitting; (3) a coordinate-free formulation of Lipschitz-type lattice\ndiscrepancy bounds.

Therefore, in this study, we present a digital\nprecoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture\nassisted by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral\nefficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity. In the proposed\nsystem, the base station performs only scalar power allocation, while a\nmulti-layer SIM acts as a wave-domain processor that spatially separates users\nand mitigates interference via nonlinear wavefront reconfiguration. This design\neliminates the need for digital or hybrid precoding, drastically reducing the\nbaseband computations. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize\nthe minimum user rate by jointly optimizing SIM phase shifts, power allocation,\nand user grouping. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an\nalternating optimization algorithm is developed, combining simultaneous\nperturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for SIM configuration and power\ncontrol with clustering-based grouping refinement. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed SIM-aided HRSMA achieves substantial gains in\nboth spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and\nnon-precoding baselines. Specifically, SIM-aided HRSMA attains comparable or\nsuperior minimum rates with significantly fewer active antennas by exploiting\nthe additional wave-domain degrees of freedom provided by multi-layer SIMs.\nThese findings highlight the potential of SIM-aided HRSMA as a low-cost,\nenergy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks."}

Inspired by cognitive\npsychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven\nSystem 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and\nlogic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over\nreliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end\ndifferentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended\nhorizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment\ninteractions.

Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility\ndata is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework\nnamed General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban\nsensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea\nand contains two major stages.

An encoder operating in continuous-time\ndynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states\nfor both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task\nis specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node\nembeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various\ntasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further\nconstruct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark.

For this regularized problem, we derive a\ncoupled extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation system, prove a\nverification theorem linking its solutions to equilibrium intensities, and\nestablish the existence of classical solutions for small time horizons via a\ncontraction mapping argument. By letting the regularization term tend to zero,\nwe formally recover a system of parabolic variational inequalities that\ncharacterizes equilibrium stopping times for the original MV problem. This\nsystem includes an additional key quadratic term--a distinction from classical\noptimal stopping, where stopping conditions depend only on comparing the value\nfunction to the instantaneous reward."}

In particular,\nthe gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied\nin recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent\nworks: the \\emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero\nunder preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD\navoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable\nquantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and\nstochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the\nnon-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as\nLipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for\ndeep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to\nGD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map\nas a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first\ntime, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss\nlandscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected,\nconvolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations\n(which includes sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, etc.) for almost all step-sizes.

Here we prove that such control is fundamentally\nimpossible under any smooth Hamiltonian dynamics. Within the full\ninfinite-dimensional algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on phase space, the\nquadratic (symplectic) subalgebra $\\mathfrak{sp}(2N,\\mathbb R)$ -- and, in the\nsingle-mode case, its $\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representation -- is the unique\nhierarchy-preserving structure: only quadratic generators produce differential\noperators that terminate at second order and thereby decouple first and second\nmoments from higher cumulants. Any smooth non-quadratic Hamiltonian introduces\nthird- and higher-order derivatives in the phase-space generator, enforcing a\nuniversal coupling between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. This\n\\emph{rigidity of the moment hierarchy} generalizes the Gaussian no-go theorems\nand identifies the analytic boundary between symplectic (Clifford) dynamics and\nthe non-simulable regime beyond the Gottesman--Knill limit."}

We prove existence and uniqueness of the optimal trading\nfrequency and show that this optimum can be interpreted through the fractal\ndimension of the price path.

In this work, we generalize this notion\nby considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that\nhave these states as exact eigenstates.These states often correspond to Quantum\nMany-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians.Motivated by\nearlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the\ndifferences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ\nin their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We\nillustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for\nwhich we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which\nalso allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic\nQMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent\nHamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent\nHamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple\nquantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for\nshort-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the\nadmissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich\nstructures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the\ninterplay between locality and QMBS."}
