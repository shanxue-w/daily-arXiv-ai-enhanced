In this paper, design and analysis are cast in a Bayesian framework, where QCD is formulated as an optimal stopping problem with partial observations. An approximately optimal detection algorithm is sought using techniques from reinforcement learning. The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows: (i) A Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the general partially observed optimal stopping problem. It is shown to converge under linear function approximation, given suitable assumptions on the basis functions. An example is provided to demonstrate that these assumptions are necessary to ensure algorithmic stability. (ii) Prior theory motivates a particular choice of features in applying Q-learning to QCD. It is shown that, in several scenarios and under ideal conditions, the resulting class of policies contains one that is approximately optimal. (iii) Numerical experiments show that Q-learning consistently produces policies that perform close to the best achievable within the chosen function class."}

Decomposition methods offer a promising solution via partitioning large problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, often with local information. These approaches reduce computational burden and improve flexibility by allowing agents to manage their local models. This article introduces a decomposition method that enables a distributed solution to OPF problems. The proposed method solves OPF problems with a sensitivity-based formulation using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We also propose a distributed method to compute system-wide sensitivities without sharing local parameters. This approach facilitates scalable optimization while satisfying global constraints and limiting data sharing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large set of test systems and compare its performance against existing decomposition methods. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the typical phase-angle formulation with a 14-times faster computation speed on average."}

This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena."}

LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization."}

This invariant turns out to be equivalent to an infinite cyclic version of the Carter-Silver-Williams (CSW) polynomial. The importance of the CSW polynomial is that half its symplectic rank gives strong lower bounds on the virtual genus. Recall that the virtual genus of a virtual link $J$ is the smallest genus of all closed orientable surfaces $Σ$ on which $J$ can be represented by a link diagram on $Σ$. Here we generalize the CSW lower bound to all quantum supergroups $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ with $m,n>0$. For $(m,n)=(1,1)$, the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ bound is the same as the CSW bound. However, changing the value of the pair $(m,n)$ can give lower bounds better than those available from other known methods. We compare the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ lower bounds to those coming from the CSW polynomial, the surface bracket, the arrow polynomial, hyperbolicity, and the Gordon-Litherland determinant test. As a first application, we show that the Seifert genus of homologically trivial knots in thickened surfaces is not additive under the connected sum operation of virtual knots. As a second application, we prove that the Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur invariant of a virtual knot is always realizable as the Alexander polynomial of an infinite cyclic cover of a knot complement in some $Σ\\times [0,1]$, but is not always so on a surface of minimal genus.

This class of graphs, including cliques and odd cycles, plays a central role in extremal graph theory. In this paper, following an influential line of research initiated by Bollobás-Nikiforov, we study the spectral supersaturation problem for color-critical graphs. Let $T_{n,r}$ be the $r$-partite Turán graph, let $\\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$ denote the family of graphs obtained from $T_{n,r}$ by adding $q$ edges, and let $λ(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$. We first prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $r+1$, there exists $δ_F > 0$ such that for sufficiently large $n$ and all $1 \\leq q \\leq δ_F \\sqrt{n}$, any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $λ(G) \\ge \\min_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} λ(T)$ contains at least $q \\cdot c(n,F)$ copies of $F$, where $c(n,F)$ denotes the minimum number of copies of $F$ created by adding a single edge to $T_{n,r}$; moreover, any extremal graph $G$ must belong to $ \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$.Next, we prove a spectral supersaturation result for the analogous condition $λ(G) \\ge \\max_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} λ(T)$, valid for all $1 \\leq q \\leq δ_F n$. Together, these results provide a complete resolution to a problem proposed by Ning-Zhai, and establish a spectral counterpart to the well-known results of Mubayi and Pikhurko-Yilma in the extremal supersaturation setting. A notable feature of our first result is that the restriction $q = O(\\sqrt{n})$ is tight up to a constant factor, in contrast to the linear bounds provided by other settings discussed above.

Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance."}

While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.\n  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlevé XXXIV, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis requires a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which needs a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.\n  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants."}

In each time slot, a decision-maker adaptively selects one of $K$ data sources and receives a paired sample generated from that source for testing. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible whether the pairs are generated from the same distribution or not. The gain achieved by such adaptive sampling (in terms of smaller expected stopping time or larger error exponents) has been well-characterized for parametric models via Chernoff's adaptive MLE selection rule [1]. However, analogous results are not known for the case of nonparametric problems, such as two-sample testing, where we place no restrictions on the distributions.\n  Our main contribution is a general active nonparametric testing procedure that combines an adaptive source-selecting strategy within the testing-by-betting framework of [2] that works under minimal distributional assumptions. In each time slot, our scheme proceeds by selecting a source according to a probability that mixes exploitation, favoring sources with the largest empirical distinguishability, and exploration via a vanishing greedy strategy. The (paired) observations so collected are then used to update the \"betting-wealth process\", which is a stochastic process guaranteed to be a nonnegative martingale under the null. The procedure stops and rejects the null when the wealth process exceeds an appropriate threshold; an event that is unlikely under the null. We show that our test controls the type-I error at a prespecified level-$α$ under the null, and establish its power-one property and a bound on its expected sample size under the alternative. Our results provide a precise characterization of the improvements achievable by a principled adaptive sampling strategy over its passive analog."}

The proof combines modified surgery theory with an equivariant version of the Schoenflies theorem, which we establish here. We also show that equivariant tubular neighborhoods of 1-dimensional fixed-point sets, when they exist, are not unique, in contrast to the nonequivariant case. Our results combine with earlier work to provide a classification of all locally linear involutions on S^4. As a further application, we obtain that strongly negative amphichiral knots with trivial Alexander polynomial are equivariantly topologically slice with respect to the linear action, strengthening a previous result of the first two authors.

It is well known that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel is discrete and supported on finitely many points. The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\\sqrt{\\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.\n  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint.

These approximation bounds are then combined with stability properties of capacity-achieving distributions to yield the final support-size lower bound."}

Here, we extend this to the category ThickenedSmoothSets of infinitesimally thickened smooth sets. We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.\n  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature."}

While operations research has traditionally developed solver-centric methods emphasizing model structure and optimality, recent advances in machine learning are reshaping scheduling into a data-centric discipline that learns from experience and adapts to dynamic environments. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative review of this methodological transition. We first revisit classical optimization-based approaches and summarize how ML has been integrated within them to improve computational efficiency. We then review end-to-end learning approaches that generate scheduling solutions directly from data, highlighting how they shift decision-making from explicit optimization to learned inference. Adopting a systematic, method-oriented perspective, we compare these paradigms and their underlying learning algorithms in terms of principles, scalability, interpretability, and generalization. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and outline future directions along three interdependent dimensions, scalability, reliability, and universality, that together define a pathway toward adaptive, intelligent, and trustworthy scheduling systems for data-driven operations management."}

A novel iterative code-aided channel estimation (ICCE) technique is developed that uses low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and iterative processing to enhance estimation accuracy while reducing pilot overhead. The core idea is to exploit encoded pilots (EP), enabling the use of both pilot and parity bits to iteratively refine channel estimates. To further improve performance, an iterative channel tracking (ICT) method is proposed that takes advantage of the temporal correlation of the channel. An analytical evaluation of the proposed estimator is provided in terms of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), along with a study of its computational complexity and the impact of the code rate. Numerical results validate the performance of the proposed scheme in a sub-6 GHz multi-RIS scenario with non-sparse propagation, under both LOS and NLOS conditions, and different RIS architectures."}

This paper demonstrates a direct derivation from non-supersymmetric quantum statistics by establishing a fundamental correspondence: the grand partition functions of non-interacting bosonic and fermionic systems are precisely the Chern characters of certain vector bundles. Furthermore, we generalize this correspondence to infinite dimensions, where we construct a novel mathematical framework of spectral-sheaf pairs. Within this framework, we formulate a generalized index theorem, identifying the topological index with a regularized spectral product. This work not only circumvents the need for supersymmetry but also provides a deeper unifying perspective, revealing quantum statistics as a sufficient foundation for topological invariants."}

In the existing literature, numerical schemes for such models often suffer from accuracy limitations and convergence problems, usually due to the lack of rigorous existence results or inherent limitations of the discretization. Therefore, our main goal is to prove the (subsequence) convergence of the proposed numerical method to a large-data global weak solution in two dimensions, without relying on cut-offs or additional regularization.

Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes. These results confirm that the proposed approach provides a practical and competitive solution to the long-standing difficulty of obtaining sharp, reliable lower eigenvalue bounds."}

Conventional satellite acquisition typically relies on time-domain beam sweeping, which incurs substantial overhead and latency. In this correspondence, we propose an efficient one-shot satellite acquisition framework that capitalizes on two phenomena traditionally regarded as impairments: i) Doppler effects and ii) beam-squint effects. Specifically, we derive a closed-form \\emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \\emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception."}

This continuous-order Maclaurin-type operator replaces the discrete sum of integer-order derivatives in the classical Maclaurin expansion with an integral over fractional derivative orders, weighted at the evaluation point by x^r/Gamma(r+1). Numerical experiments on a representative set of analytic functions f show that the uncorrected operator reliably tracks the global shape of f, with a systematic, largely constant offset and an additional deviation localized at the origin. Low-order correction terms, motivated by the classical Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, reduce this discrepancy. With these corrections, the operator reconstructs f accurately in the tested domains. The operator reproduces monomials exactly, reflecting the collapse of derivative information to a single order, as in the classical Maclaurin expansion of monomials. This singular collapse motivates a Taylor-centered extension away from the origin, where the order dependence is predicted to be smooth. Taken together, these results suggest that the continuous-order integration operator, with low-order corrections, provides a coherent framework for generalizing the classical Taylor-Maclaurin expansion."}

Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes.

We define a suite of semantics for $HAFS$s, including extension-based semantics, adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued semantics), and numerical equational semantics ([0,1]-valued semantics). Furthermore, we develop a normal encoding methodology to translate $HAFS$s into propositional logic systems ($\\mathcal{PLS}$s): $HAFS$s under complete labelling semantics are encoded into Łukasiewicz's three-valued propositional logic ($\\mathcal{PL}_3^L$), and those under equational semantics are encoded into fuzzy $\\mathcal{PLS}$s ($\\mathcal{PL}_{[0,1]}$) such as Gödel and Product fuzzy logics. We prove model equivalence between $HAFS$s and their encoded logical formulas, establishing the logical foundation of $HAFS$ semantics.

By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius.

We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work."}

With the help of the $\\ell$-invariant, this extends to links the Etnyre-Honda result about the arc index and maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of torus knots. It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity.

This phenomenon underlies the success of shrinkage priors, regularization, and approximate Bayesian methods, yet it is typically described only informally through notions such as sparsity, intrinsic dimension, or degrees of freedom. In this paper we introduce the \\emph{Bayesian effective dimension}, a model- and prior-dependent quantity defined through the mutual information between parameters and data. This notion quantifies the expected information gain from prior to posterior and provides a coordinate-free measure of how many directions in parameter space are statistically learnable at a given sample size. In regular parametric models the effective dimension coincides with the usual parameter dimension, while in high-dimensional, ill-posed, or strongly regularized settings it can be substantially smaller. We develop basic properties of the effective dimension and present explicit calculations for Gaussian location models and linear models with general design, revealing close connections with spectral complexity and effective rank. These examples illustrate how shrinkage and regularization mechanisms directly control the growth of effective dimension. The framework offers a unifying perspective on dimension reduction in Bayesian inference and provides insight into uncertainty quantification and the behavior of approximate posterior distributions."}

The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system.

Building on this, we design a distributed port selection strategy that minimizes per-AP channel estimation error by exploiting spatial correlation among FA ports. We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound. Finally, we propose an alternating-optimization framework to select FA port configurations that maximize the uplink sum SE. Numerical results show that the proposed FA-aware channel estimation and port optimization strategies greatly reduce channel estimation error and significantly improve sum-SE over fixed-antenna and non-optimized FA baselines, confirming FAs as a key enabler for scalable, adaptive CF-mMIMO networks."}

Classical approaches involve uncertainty quantification via confidence intervals and bootstrap methods. In contrast, recent work proposes a more stringent form of robustness: stability to the removal of any subset of $k$ samples from the training set. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of this criterion for ordinary least squares (OLS). Our contributions are as follows: (1) Given $n$ i.i.d. training samples from a general misspecified model, we prove that with high probability, OLS is robust to the removal of any $k \\ll n $ samples. (2) For data of dimension $p$, OLS can withstand up to ${k\\ll \\sqrt{np}/\\log n}$ sample removals while remaining robust and achieving the same error rate as OLS applied to the full dataset. Conversely, if $k$ is proportional to $n$, OLS is provably non-robust. (3) We revisit prior analyses that found several econometric datasets to be highly non-robust to sample removals. While this appears to contradict our results in (1), we demonstrate that the sensitivity is due to either heavy-tailed responses or correlated samples. Empirically, this sensitivity is considerably attenuated by classical robust methods, such as linear regression with a Huber loss."}

We argue that CP is best understood as a rank-calibrated descendant of the Fisher-Dempster-Hill fiducial/direct-probability tradition rather than as Bayesian conditioning in disguise.\n  We establish four separations from coherent countably additive predictive semantics. First, canonical conformal constructions violate conditional extensionality: prediction sets can depend on the marginal design P(X) even when P(Y|X) is fixed. Second, any finitely additive sequential extension preserving rank calibration is nonconglomerable, implying countable Dutch-book vulnerabilities. Third, rank-calibrated updates cannot be realized as regular conditionals of any countably additive exchangeable law on Y^infty. Fourth, formalizing both paradigms as families of one-step predictive kernels, conformal and Bayesian kernels coincide only on a Baire-meagre subset of the space of predictive laws.\n  We further show that rank- and proxy-based reductions are generically Blackwell-deficient relative to full-data experiments, yielding positive Le Cam deficiency for suitable losses. Extending the analysis to prediction-powered inference (PPI) yields an analogous message: bias-corrected, proxy-rectified estimators can be valid as confidence devices while failing to define transportable belief states across stages, shifts, or adaptive selection.

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can effectively shape the wireless propagation to match the environment and improve communication performance. However, in conventional RSMA-RIS architectures, the antenna elements are fixed, which underutilizes spatial degrees of freedom and hence constrains system performance. To address this limitation, we propose a movable-antenna (MA) assisted RSMA-RIS framework and formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming matrix, the RIS reflection matrix, the common-rate partition, and the MA positions. The original problem is equivalently transformed by employing the fractional programming (FP) method, and a closed-form solution for the common rate splitting is derived. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we obtain iterative updates for the Lagrange multipliers together with a closed-form expression for the beamforming matrix. We then develop an update rule for the RIS reflection matrix via the dual problem, and finally determine the optimal antenna locations using a gradient-ascent procedure. Numerical results indicate that, even in the presence of RIS assistance, incorporating MAs yields additional performance improvements for RSMA. Moreover, relative to space-division multiple access (SDMA), the assistance of MA yields a greater performance gain for RSMA."}

The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system.

Bethe subspaces are naturally parametrized by the complement of the corresponding toric arrangement . We prove that this family extends regularly to the minimal wonderful model $X_Φ$ of the toric arrangement described by De Concini and Gaiffi, thus giving a compactification of the parameter space for Bethe subspaces. For classical types $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$, we show that this extension is faithful. As a special case, when $Φ$ is of type $A_n$, our construction agrees with the main result of Aguirre--Felder--Veselov on the closure of the set of quadratic Gaudin subalgebras. Our work is also closely related to, and refines in this root system setting, a parallel compactification result of J. Peters obtained for more general toric arrangements arising from quantum multiplication on hypertoric varieties. Next, we show that the Bethe subspaces assemble into a vector bundle over $X_Φ$, which we identify with the logarithmic tangent bundle of $X_Φ$. Finally, we formulate conjectures extending these results to the setting of Bethe subalgebras in Yangians and to the quantum cohomology rings of Springer resolutions. We plan to address this in our next papers."}

This framework effectively balances strong sparsity promotion with solution stability, and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional variable selection involving highly correlated features. Built upon a difference-of-convex (DC) structure, DCEN employs two continuously tunable parameters to unify classical and state-of-the-art models--including Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge, and $\\ell_1-α\\ell_2$--as special cases. Theoretically, sufficient conditions for exact and stable recovery are established under the restricted isometry property (RIP), and a closed-form expression of the DCEN regularization proximal operator is derived. Moreover, two efficient optimization algorithms are developed based on the DC algorithm (DCA) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Within the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) framework, the global convergence of DCA and its linear convergence rate are rigorously established. Furthermore, DCEN is extended to image reconstruction by incorporating total variation (TV) regularization, yielding the DCEN-TV model, which is efficiently solved via the Split Bregman method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DCEN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sparse signal recovery, high-dimensional variable selection under strong collinearity, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction, achieving superior recovery accuracy and robustness."}

This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility."}

Solving this kinetic equation and estimating the moments of its solution are essential tasks, typically carried out using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. However, for large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost. To accelerate the calculation, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method (Mortier et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) and a corresponding fluid estimation technique (Mortier et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys., 2022) have recently been proposed. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of KDMC combined with the associated fluid estimation. The analysis consists of proving theoretical upper bounds for both KDMC and the fluid estimation, and numerical verifications of these bounds. In addition, we compare the analyzed algorithm with a purely fluid-based method using the fully kinetic MC method as a reference. The algorithm consistently achieves lower error than the fluid-based method, and even one order of magnitude lower in a fusion-relevant test case.

This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority."}

In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA."}

In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems."}

A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer.

Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists.

A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.\n  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities."}

The goal is to estimate a linear model from many noisy covariates and many noisy instruments. Our key assumption is that true covariates and true instruments are repetitive, though possibly different in nature; they each reflect a few underlying factors, however those underlying factors may be misaligned. We analyze a family of estimators based on two stage least squares with spectral regularization: canonical correlations between covariates and instruments are learned in the first stage, which are used as regressors in the second stage. As a theoretical contribution, we derive upper and lower bounds on estimation error, proving optimality of the method with noisy data.

Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon.

Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation."}

In each time slot, a decision-maker adaptively selects one of $K$ data sources and receives a paired sample generated from that source for testing. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible whether the pairs are generated from the same distribution or not. The gain achieved by such adaptive sampling (in terms of smaller expected stopping time or larger error exponents) has been well-characterized for parametric models via Chernoff's adaptive MLE selection rule [1]. However, analogous results are not known for the case of nonparametric problems, such as two-sample testing, where we place no restrictions on the distributions.\n  Our main contribution is a general active nonparametric testing procedure that combines an adaptive source-selecting strategy within the testing-by-betting framework of [2] that works under minimal distributional assumptions. In each time slot, our scheme proceeds by selecting a source according to a probability that mixes exploitation, favoring sources with the largest empirical distinguishability, and exploration via a vanishing greedy strategy. The (paired) observations so collected are then used to update the \"betting-wealth process\", which is a stochastic process guaranteed to be a nonnegative martingale under the null. The procedure stops and rejects the null when the wealth process exceeds an appropriate threshold; an event that is unlikely under the null. We show that our test controls the type-I error at a prespecified level-$α$ under the null, and establish its power-one property and a bound on its expected sample size under the alternative. Our results provide a precise characterization of the improvements achievable by a principled adaptive sampling strategy over its passive analog."}

Additionally, the curvature of the free surface and submerged bodies is incorporated through curvilinear elements obtained via transfinite linear blending, which conserves the high-order convergent properties of the overall scheme. The model is applied to several benchmark cases in two spatial dimensions. Initially, it addresses fixed-domain problems, including the lid-driven cavity flow and flows around bodies such as a cylinder and a NACA airfoil.

We carried out a survey to inform our model and stratify the population into six groups based on income and perception of authority, capturing behavioral heterogeneity. Individuals adjust their socialization and vaccination levels to optimize objectives such as minimizing treatment costs, complying with social-distancing guidelines if they are authority-followers, or reducing losses from decreased social interactions if they are authority-indifferents, alongside economic costs. Public health authorities influence behavior through social-distancing guidelines and vaccination costs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium via a forward-backward differential equation system, provide its mathematical analysis, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve it. Our findings reveal a trade-off between social-distancing and vaccination decisions. Under stricter guidelines that target both susceptible and infected individuals, followers reduce both socialization and vaccination levels, while indifferents increase socialization due to followers' preventative measures. Adaptive guidelines targeting infected individuals effectively reduce infections and narrow the gap between low- and high-income groups, even when susceptible individuals socialize more and vaccinate less. Lower vaccination costs incentivize vaccination among low-income groups, but their impact on disease spread is smaller than when they are coupled with social-distancing guidelines. Trust-building emerges as a critical factor in epidemic mitigation, underscoring the importance of data-informed, game-theoretical models that aim to understand complex human responses to mitigation policies."}

As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu.

In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\\{-1, 1\\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability."}

This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena."}

The stabilization problem is NP-hard for general descriptor systems. Existing approaches often rely on explicit knowledge of the structure-defining matrix $Q$, which is difficult to determine in practice. When $Q$ is unknown, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which proportional output feedback ensures that the closed-loop system is regular, impulse-free, asymptotically stable, and retains the port-Hamiltonian structure. These conditions also allow any positive definite matrix to serve as the feedback matrix. The framework is further extended to proportional and derivative output feedback, enabling the assignment of a desired dynamical order. The proposed method thus generalizes existing stabilization results from the special case $Q = I$ to systems with an unknown $Q$, offering a systematic method to structure-preserving stabilization of pH descriptor systems."}

We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.\n  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature."}

Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL."}

The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems."}

The electric potential satisfies electrostatic equations in the extra- and intracellular domains, while its jump across the cell membrane evolves according to a nonlinear law coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the porosity degree. We prove the well-posedness of the microscopic problem, derive a priori estimates, obtain formal asymptotics, and rigorously justify the expansion combining two-scale convergence with monotonicity arguments. The resulting macroscopic model exhibits memory effects and a nonlinear, time-dependent effective current. It captures the nontrivial evolution of effective conductivity, including a characteristic drop reflecting the capacitive behavior of the lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental data. Numerical computations of the effective conductivity confirm that, although microscopic conductivity is constant, tissue conductivity varies nonlinearly with electric field strength, showing a sigmoid trend.

Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.\n  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation.

We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Matérn Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings.

The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property."}

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse.

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change."}

Using our framework, we present an edge-based sampling approach for testing properties pertaining to hubs in large graphs.

Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach."}

We perform this investigation for two prototypical Hamiltonian systems, namely the well-known Hénon-Heiles system of two degrees of freedom and a system of three nonlinearly coupled harmonic oscillators having three degrees of freedom, finding very similar results for the two methods and thus recommending the more efficient one. We find that the accuracy of two-dimesnional center subspace computations is significantly reduced when the backward evolution stages of the algorithm are performed over long time intervals. We explain this observation by examining the tangent dynamics of the center subspace wherein CLVs tend to align/anti-align, and we propose an adaptation of the algorithm that improves the accuracy of such computations over long times by preventing this alignment/anti-alignment of CLVs in the center subspace."}

The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms.

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes."}

While LinCov methods offer improved computational efficiency compared to Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis, they inherently rely on linearization approximations. Understanding the fidelity of these approximations and identifying when they are deficient is critically important for spacecraft navigation and mission planning, especially when dealing with highly nonlinear systems and large state uncertainties. This work presents a number of computational techniques for assessing linear covariance performance. These new LinCov fidelity measures are formulated using higher-order statistics, constrained optimization, and the unscented transform."}

The set $\\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields.

The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes."}

We assume the same control bound for the two Raman fields (pump and Stokes) and a different bound for the field connecting directly the two lower-energy states. Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse-sequences, for relatively larger values of the ratio between the two control bounds, and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as functions of this ratio. For smaller values of the bounds ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse-sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning."}

Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path.

This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority."}

Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu.

It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen.

Barman and Bishal Das contributed equally to this work. 38 pages (27 pages main, 11 pages supplement), 17 figures (11 figures main, 6 figures supplement), 2 tables (all in main)", "summary": "Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices."}

The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property."}

In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation."}

However, after introducing the mixed unitary index of a unital quantum channel as the least time beyond which all subsequent powers of the channel are mixed unitary, we demonstrate that for any fixed finite dimension $d\\geq 3$, there exists no universal upper bound for this index. Furthermore, for a continuous semigroup that is not mixed unitary for some $t>0$, we prove it remains non-mixed unitary for all times $t>0$, sufficiently close to the origin. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a quantum dynamical semigroup to be a convex combination of maps implemented solely by Weyl unitaries."}

To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal."}

However, Min Coloring and k-Coloring are easy on both families because they are 2-colorable and 3-colorable, respectively.\n  We show that Min Coloring is NP-hard on the class $\\mathcal T_3$ of graphs of twin-width at most 3. This is the first hardness result on $\\mathcal T_3$ for a problem that is easy on cographs (twin-width 0), on trees (whose twin-width is at most 2), and on unit circular-arc graphs (whose twin-width is at most 3). We also show that for every $k \\geqslant 3$, k-Coloring is NP-hard on $\\mathcal T_4$. We finally make two observations: (1) there are currently very few problems known to be in P on $\\mathcal T_d$ (graphs of twin-width at most $d$) and NP-hard on $\\mathcal T_{d+1}$ for some nonnegative integer $d$, and (2) unlike $\\mathcal T_4$, which contains every graph as an induced minor, the class $\\mathcal T_3$ excludes a fixed planar graph as an induced minor; thus it may be viewed as a special case (or potential counterexample) for conjectures about classes excluding a (planar) induced minor.

We present polynomial-time algorithms for MSC in several nontrivial settings. Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs."}
