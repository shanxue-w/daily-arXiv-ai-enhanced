The standard construction of\nthese groups involves maps out of the absolute Galois group $G_K$, which in\nmany cases of interest (e.g. $K = \\mathbb{Q}$) is too large for computation or\neven for gaining an intuitive grasp. However, for finite $M$, an element of\n$H^i(K,M)$ can be described by a finite amount of data. For the important case\n$i = 1$, the appropriate object is an \\'etale algebra over $K$ (a finite\nproduct of separable field extensions) whose Galois group is a subgroup of the\nsemidirect product $\\operatorname{Hol} M = M \\rtimes \\operatorname{Aut} M$\n(often called the \\emph{holomorph} of $M$), equipped with a little bit of\ncombinatorial data.\n  Although the correspondence between $H^1$ and field extensions is in\nwidespread use, it includes some combinatorial and Galois-theoretic details\nthat seem never to have been written down. In this short quasi-expository\npaper, we fill in this gap and explain how the \\'etale algebra perspective\nilluminates some common uses of $H^1$, including parametrizing cubic and\nquartic algebras as well as computing the Tate pairing on Galois coclasses of\nlocal fields."}

The\nGPTE problem extends the PTE problem by allowing different sets of exponents,\nwhile the FPTE problem considers cases where the number of integers in the two\nsets differs by one. Multigrade chains are also investigated, involving\nmultiple sets of integers satisfying the GPTE system. The study of PTE and GPTE\nproblems is further extended from integers to trigonometric functions. Three\nnovel generalizations of the Girard-Newton Identities are introduced to solve\nthe PTE and GPTE problems: the first extends the domain of exponents to all\nintegers; the second further generalizes to a broader form; and the third\nfocuses on odd integer exponents. The constant $C$ in the PTE and GPTE problems\nis investigated, and a novel approach is proposed by introducing the normalized\nGPTE problem with six conjectures to determine bounds for each variable. This\nenhances the efficiency of computer searches for ideal non-negative integer\nsolutions that satisfy $\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i^k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} b_i^k$ for $k\n= k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n$.

Six open problems related to the PTE and\nGPTE problems are proposed, and three approaches to address these problems are\nsuggested.

One option is to\ncompute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to\nexisting numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem\nhas to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization\ntoward the \"true\" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical\ndimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a\nself-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of\nsound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave\nfield by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,\nwe study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition\nand the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound\nmodel to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence\nbehavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$\nerror compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network\narchitecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least\nsix training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and\nsubsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative\naiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including\nabsorbers."}
