In the centuries since its initial formulation, a\nstandard textbook theory has emerged according to which the general solution\nmay be determined if a particular solution is known; but no general method\nexists to determine a particular solution explicitly, except in sporadic\nspecial cases. The purpose of the present article is to solve the scalar\nRiccati equation in general form, as well as the general linear ODE of second\norder, directly by explicit construction. In the case of the Riccati equation,\nthe solution sets up a bijective correspondence between triples of locally\nintegrable functions on the real line, and locally absolutely continuous paths\nthrough the identity in the automorphism group of the Riemann sphere. As\napplications of the results, we obtain an explicit solution to the\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation, an inversion formula for the Miura\ntransform, and a new formula for Airy functions."}

Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover\ngeneric orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of\n$L^2({\\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and\ndiscretizing the radial direction.

By combining this with\nearlier work of Kurmazov on nilpotent subgroups of alternating groups, we\ncomplete the proof of Vdovin's conjecture. Moreover, by combining our proof for\ngroups of Lie type with earlier work of Zenkov on alternating and sporadic\ngroups, we are able to establish a stronger form of Vdovin's conjecture: if $G$\nis simple and $A,B$ are nilpotent subgroups, then $A \\cap B^x = 1$ for some $x\n\\in G$. In addition, we study the asymptotic probability that a random pair of\nSylow $p$-subgroups in a simple group of Lie type intersect trivially,\ncomplementing recent work of Diaconis et al. and Eberhard on symmetric and\nalternating groups."}

The estimators we study have some positive\nproperties, such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and large deviation\nprinciples. The main advantages are that they require only a sample of votes\nbelonging to a (possibly very small) subset of the population and have a low\ncomputational cost. Due to the wide application of models such as Curie-Weiss,\nthese estimators are potentially useful in disciplines such as political\nscience, sociology, automated voting, and preference aggregation."}

Furthermore, we show that $\\mathbb{P}\\textrm{L}_J$\nis homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\\textrm{Gr}_J(\\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$\nover the triangular hyperfield $\\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the\ncontext of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q>0$. This\nidentification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids\ndeveloped in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth\nauthors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of\n$\\mathbb{P}\\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results\nshow that $\\mathbb{P}\\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification\nhomeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a\nquestion of Br\\\"and\\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of\n$\\mathbb{P}\\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo\n$\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In\naddition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling\nclasses of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex\nGrassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric\nframework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian\npolynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry."}

However, the success of these state-of-the-art\nmodels largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which\nlack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises\nquestions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.\nTo address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel\ninformation-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should\nbe a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based\non this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space\nModel (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by\noptimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach\nencourages the model to maximally compress historical information without\nlosing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and\nspurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsignificantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy\nscenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the\nMPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance\nother popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential."}

Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in\nthe engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.\nIn this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam\nlattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By\napplying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of\nequations in the frequency domain.

Through dedicated\nanalysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice\nand continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for\nhomogenization errors. Numerical experiments validate the optimality of the\nhomogenization rate estimates."}

While many of the DDs used in the\nprobabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is\nnot without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small\nrounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the\neffectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the\nnumerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical\nerrors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision\ndiagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest\nbecause it is the function that computes successor states for both\nprobabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector\nmultiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain\nconditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these\nconditions are not met. Additionally, we provide a case study of the numerical\nerrors in the simulation of quantum circuits, which shows that the extent of\nnumerical errors in practice varies greatly between instances."}

The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is\nlong enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter\nthan the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of\nMonte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like\nthe forth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse\nallowed error.

Yet, training them via backpropagation is often\nhindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as\northogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,\nallow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.\nIn this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a\nbroad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose\ninput-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.\nSuch a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical\nisometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not\nonly recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new\ndesigns that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on\nconventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect\nJacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training\nand achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks\nregularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable\nresults. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks\nwell-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks\nwith Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are\nthen showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties."}

The proposed NSFD\ndiscretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential\nqualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are\noften compromised by standard finite difference methods.
