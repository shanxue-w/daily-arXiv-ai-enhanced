This consists of choosing withdrawals and\ntransfers from and between several accounts with different tax treatments,\ntaking into account basic rules such as required minimum distributions and\nlimits on Roth conversions, additional income, liabilities, taxes, and the\nbequest when the retiree dies. We develop a retirement funding policy in two\nsteps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which\nvarious future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future\ninvestment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model\nof taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where\nwe maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted\nconsumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and\nreliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy\nthat determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at\nthat time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using\nthe current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated\ninformation such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out\nthe actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle\nis repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC).\nThe MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns\nand inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income\nand liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the MPC retirement policy using Monte Carlo simulation."}

Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering\nrule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based\nmodels invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while\nmean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,\nparticularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox\nthrough a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,\nmodeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.\nDespite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering\nrules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent\nbehavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more\nwhen overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),\nbut will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more\nnuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of\nrisk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent\nmodels, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in\ncoherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable\napproach. We further extend the results to multi-product settings with\narbitrary demand dependencies, showing that optimal order quantities remain\nseparable and can be obtained by solving single-product problems independently."}

In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations.

A fractional matching of $G$\nis called a fractional perfect matching if $\\sum\\limits_{e\\in E_G(v)}{h(e)}=1$\nfor any $v\\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ with at least $2k+2$ vertices is said to be\nfractional $k$-extendable if every $k$-matching $M$ in $G$ is included in a\nfractional perfect matching $h$ of $G$ such that $h(e)=1$ for any $e\\in M$.\nThis paper considers a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to guarantee\nthat $G$ has a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$. At the same time,\nwe obtain a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ is\nfractional $k$-extendable."}

When disorder is absent and the phase transition is\ndiscontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than\nthe minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to\ncreate one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest\nof the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it\nis known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this \\emph{big jump\nphenomenon} is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the\nconditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the\ndisorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong\nsense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\\log n)$. The proof is achieved by\nexploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered\npinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in\nparticular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis\nof the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact\ndensity and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we\nestablish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability\nconditions, thus generalizing [11,32]."}

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements.

For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we\nderive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function\n(CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF.
