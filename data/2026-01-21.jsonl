This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online."}

Boundary interpolation is imposed by prescribing the boundary rows and columns of the control net, while the interior control points are selected by a Dirichlet principle: for each admissible choice of Bézier basis shape parameters, we compute the unique Dirichlet-energy extremal within the corresponding GT--Bézier patch space, which yields a parameter-dependent symmetric linear system for the interior control net under standard nondegeneracy assumptions. The remaining design freedom is thereby reduced to a four-parameter optimization problem, which we solve by particle swarm optimization. Numerical experiments show that the resulting two-level procedure consistently decreases the Dirichlet energy and, in our tests, often reduces the realized surface area relative to classical Bernstein--Bézier Dirichlet patches and representative quasi-harmonic and bending-energy constructions under identical boundary control data. We further adapt the same Dirichlet-extremal methodology to a hybrid tensor-product/bilinear Coons framework, obtaining minimality-biased TB--Coons patches from sparse boundary specifications."}

Such models, widely used in the random feature method (RFM) and extreme learning machines (ELM), transform network training into a linear least-squares problem. In this paper, we conduct a numerical study of the variational (Galerkin) and collocation formulations for these linearized networks. Our numerical results reveal that, in the variational formulation, the associated linear systems are severely ill-conditioned, forming the primary computational bottleneck in scaling the neural network size, even when direct solvers are employed. In contrast, collocation methods combined with robust least-squares solvers exhibit better numerical stability and achieve higher accuracy as we increase neuron numbers. This behavior is consistently observed for both ReLU$^k$ and $\\tanh$ activations, with $\\tanh$ networks exhibiting even worse conditioning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that random sampling of the hidden layer parameters, commonly used in RFM and ELM, is not necessary for achieving high accuracy. For ReLU$^k$ activations, this follows from existing theory and is verified numerically in this paper, while for $\\tanh$ activations, we introduce two deterministic schemes that achieve comparable accuracy."}

Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \\( ν^{1/2} \\) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice."}

This investigation is motivated by the work of Lev Aizenberg [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 128 (2000), 1147-1155], where the corresponding problem was studied for complex valued holomorphic functions. We show that the second Bohr radius constant for pluriharmonic functions is strictly positive under suitable condition. In addition, we obtain its asymptotic behavior in the finite-dimensional settings using invariants from local Banach space theory. Asymptotic estimates for this constant are obtained on both convex and non-convex complete Reinhardt domains. Our results also apply to a broad class of Banach sequence spaces, including symmetric and convex Banach spaces. The framework developed here also includes the second Bohr radius problem for vector valued holomorphic functions. As an application of our results, we derive several consequences that extend known results in the scalar valued setting as well as existing results in the literature."}

Stability plays a crucial role in understanding generalization, robustness, and replicability, and a variety of stability notions have been proposed in different learning settings. However, while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning -- and indeed, it may be at odds with accuracy, since an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Thus, it is essential to understand the potential statistical cost of stability. In this work, we address this question by adopting a statistical decision-theoretic perspective, treating stability as a constraint in estimation. Focusing on two representative notions-worst-case stability and average-case stability-we first establish general lower bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy under each type of stability constraint. We then develop optimal stable estimators for four canonical estimation problems, including several mean estimation and regression settings. Together, these results characterize the optimal trade-offs between stability and accuracy across these tasks. Our findings formalize the intuition that average-case stability imposes a qualitatively weaker restriction than worst-case stability, and they further reveal that the gap between these two can vary substantially across different estimation problems."}

As a result we describe the measures as hidden Markov measures and can deduce the large deviations results by contraction from the corresponding ones for the enlarged Markov chain.

The argument follows the constructive truncation scheme: principal truncations are oscillatory, hence have simple positive spectra, and a suitable choice of initial conditions ensures positivity of the Christoffel coefficients and of the resulting discrete matrix-valued measures supported at the truncation eigenvalues. The main difficulty is the passage to the limit of these discrete measures beyond the bounded case.

The problem in literature is known as the waist problem, and only convexity rescued in this case. Motivated by this we generalize it by replacing lines with a number of convex sets in the Euclidean space and ask to minimize the sum of distances connecting the sets by means of closed polygonal curve. This generalized problem significantly broadens its geometric and practical scope in view of modern convex analysis. We establish the existence of solutions and prove its uniqueness under the condition that at least one of the convex sets is strictly convex and all are in general position: each set can be separated by convex hull of others. A complete set of necessary and sufficient optimality conditions is derived, and their geometric interpretations are explored to link these conditions with classical principles such as the reflection law of light. To address this problem computationally, we develop a projected subgradient descent method and prove its convergence. Our algorithm is supported by detailed numerical experiments, particularly in cases involving discs and spheres.

We use the Riemann mapping to equivalently reformulate the resulting two-dimensional free boundary problem as a single one-dimensional fully nonlinear pseudodifferential equation for a function describing the domain's geometry.

To solve these problems we develop various tools such as the Strong Symplectic Spectral Property (SSSP) and its consequences such as the Supergraph Theorem, the Bifurcation Theorem, and the Matrix Liberation Lemma for symplectic eigenvalues, graph couplings to describe collections of labelings of a graph that produce the same symplectic eigenvalues, and coupled graph zero forcing. We establish numerous results for symplectic positive definite matrices, including a sharp lower bound on the number of nonzero entries of such a matrix (or equivalently, the number of edges in its graph). This lower bound is a consequence of a lower bound on the sum of number of nonzero entries in an irreducible positive definite matrix and its inverse."}

While mid-20th-century symbolic approaches successfully automated formal logic, they faced severe scalability limitations due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. The recent integration of data-driven approaches has revitalized this pursuit. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of AI4Math, highlighting its primary focus on developing AI models to support mathematical research. Crucially, we emphasize that this is not merely the application of AI to mathematical activities; it also encompasses the development of stronger AI systems where the rigorous nature of mathematics serves as a premier testbed for advancing general reasoning capabilities. We categorize existing research into two complementary directions: problem-specific modeling, involving the design of specialized architectures for distinct mathematical tasks, and general-purpose modeling, focusing on foundation models capable of broader reasoning, retrieval, and exploratory workflows. We conclude by discussing key challenges and prospects, advocating for AI systems that go beyond facilitating formal correctness to enabling the discovery of meaningful results and unified theories, recognizing that the true value of a proof lies in the insights and tools it offers to the broader mathematical landscape."}

The answer turns out to be positive for appropriate modifications of both ``other methods''. The analogues of these ``other methods'' for the non-homogeneous Markov chains are also presented.

In data applications, TVaR is often estimated using the empirical method, owing to its simplicity and nonparametric nature. The empirical TVaR has been explicitly advocated by regulatory authorities as a standard approach for computing TVaR. However, prior literature has pointed out that the empirical TVaR estimator is negatively biased, which can lead to a systemic underestimation of risk in finite-sample applications. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of the bias of the empirical TVaR estimator in two dimensions: its magnitude as well as the key distributional and structural determinants driving the severity of the bias. To this end, we derive a leading-term approximation for the bias based on its asymptotic expansion. The closed-form expression associated with the leading-term approximation enables us to obtain analytical insights into the structural properties governing the bias of the empirical TVaR estimator. To account for the discrepancy between the leading-term approximation and the true bias, we further derive an explicit upper bound for the bias. We validate the proposed bias analysis framework via simulations and demonstrate its practical relevance using real data."}

This construction serves as an analogue to the web of coalescing random walks studied by Tóth and Werner (1998), replacing simple symmetric random walks with Pólya walks as primary constituents. First, we study the general web of up-right oriented coalescing random walks. We investigate its geometric properties and prove that certain indicator random variables satisfy negative association. Notably, the proof involves a non-trivial application of the van den Berg-Kesten-Reimer (BKR) inequality. Based on this property, we derive a strong law for the number of connected components generated by walks starting at the same time. Subsequently, we focus on the specific properties of the Pólya Web. It is well-known that the normalized coordinates of a single Pólya Walk converge almost surely to a beta-distributed random variable. We determine the joint distribution of these limiting variables in the coalescing framework. Using these joint densities, we provide exact calculations regarding the almost sure convergence of the number of components. Finally, by applying a local scaling to the Pólya Web at the edges, we introduce the Yule Web, a web of coalescing Yule processes. We demonstrate that the fundamental properties and results derived for the Pólya Web can be extended to this limiting case."}

However, classical LiNGAM methods rely on the strong assumption that there exists an ordering under which the noise terms are exactly independent, an assumption that is often violated in the presence of confounding. In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal order estimation that remains applicable under arbitrary confounding. Rather than imposing independence as a hard constraint, we quantify the degree of confounding by the multivariate mutual information among the noise variables. This quantity is decomposed into a sum of mutual information terms along a causal order and is estimated using Bayesian marginal likelihoods. The resulting criterion can be interpreted as Bayesian ICA for causal discovery, where causal order selection is formulated as a model selection problem over permutations. Under standard regularity conditions, we show that the proposed Bayesian mutual information estimator is consistent, with redundancy of order $O(\\log n)$. To avoid non-identifiability caused by Gaussian noise, we employ non-Gaussian predictive models, including multivariate $t$ distributions, whose marginal likelihoods can be evaluated via MCMC. The proposed method recovers classical LiNGAM and DirectLiNGAM as limiting cases in the absence of confounding, while providing a principled ranking of causal orders when confounding is present. This establishes a unified, confounding-aware, and information-theoretically grounded extension of ICA-based causal discovery."}

This construction serves as an analogue to the web of coalescing random walks studied by Tóth and Werner (1998), replacing simple symmetric random walks with Pólya walks as primary constituents. First, we study the general web of up-right oriented coalescing random walks. We investigate its geometric properties and prove that certain indicator random variables satisfy negative association. Notably, the proof involves a non-trivial application of the van den Berg-Kesten-Reimer (BKR) inequality. Based on this property, we derive a strong law for the number of connected components generated by walks starting at the same time. Subsequently, we focus on the specific properties of the Pólya Web. It is well-known that the normalized coordinates of a single Pólya Walk converge almost surely to a beta-distributed random variable. We determine the joint distribution of these limiting variables in the coalescing framework. Using these joint densities, we provide exact calculations regarding the almost sure convergence of the number of components. Finally, by applying a local scaling to the Pólya Web at the edges, we introduce the Yule Web, a web of coalescing Yule processes. We demonstrate that the fundamental properties and results derived for the Pólya Web can be extended to this limiting case."}

However, the limited range and long charging durations of battery electric buses (BEBs) introduce significant operational complexities, necessitating innovative scheduling and charging strategies. This study proposes an integrated mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize vehicle scheduling and charging strategies for mixed fleets of BEBs and diesel buses. Unlike existing models, which often assume a fixed BEB fleet size or restrict charging to a single charger type, our approach simultaneously determines the optimal fleet composition, scheduling, and flexible partial charging strategy incorporating both slow and fast chargers at garages and terminal stations. The model minimizes combined fleet purchase and operational costs. A queuing strategy is introduced, departing from traditional first-come, first-served methods by dynamically allocating waiting and charging times based on operational priorities and resource availability, improving overall scheduling efficiency. To overcome computational complexities arising from numerous variables, a column generation framework is developed, facilitating scalable solutions for large-scale transit networks. Numerical experiments using real-world transit data from the Chicago Transit Authority and the Pace suburban bus systems demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Results indicate that while a full transition to alternative powertrains results in a modest cost increase, optimal mixed-fleet configurations can actually reduce total system costs. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses reveal that restricting charging to garages significantly increases fleet size and operational costs, underscoring the potential of distributed opportunistic charging."}

Approximability as introduced here is a property of metric spaces that is more general than precompactness. It is shown that several classes of Lagrangian submanifolds - closed Lagrangian submanifolds in a cotangent disk bundle; equators on the sphere; weakly exact Lagrangians on the torus-endowed with the spectral metric are approximable in this sense. Among other geometric applications, we show that there are such examples of spaces of Lagrangians that are approximable but are not precompact."}

Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes."}

To solve these problems, mixed-integer reformulations are required, but traditional reformulation schemes, such as Big-M and Hull, either yield a weak continuous relaxation or result in a bloated model size. Castro and Grossmann showed that scheduling problems can be formulated as GDP by modeling task orderings as disjunctions with algebraic timing constraints. Moreover, in their work, a particular representation of the single-unit scheduling problem, namely using a time-slot concept, can be reformulated as a tight yet compact mixed-integer linear program with notable computational performance. Based on that observation, and focusing on the case where the constraints in disjunctions are linear and share the same coefficients, we connect the characterization of the convex hull of these disjunctive sets by Jeroslow and Blair with Castro and Grossmann's time-slot reaggregation strategy to derive a unified reformulation methodology. We test this reformulation in two problems, single-unit scheduling and two-dimensional strip-packing. We derive new formulations of the general precedence concept of single-unit scheduling and symmetry-breaking formulations of the strip-packing problem, yielding mixed-integer programs with strong theoretical guarantees, particularly compact formulations in terms of continuous variables, and efficient computational performance when solving them with commercial mixed-integer solvers for these problems."}

However, monochromatic fields do not belong to the Hilbert space of free Maxwell fields, since their norms diverge. Moreover, the continuous frequency integrals involved in such expansions complicate the treatment of light--matter interactions via the scattering operator. Here, we identify and study a polychromatic basis for free Maxwell fields whose basis vectors belong to the Hilbert space. These vectors are defined as simultaneous eigenstates of four commuting operators with integer eigenvalues. As a consequence, the basis set is countable, and the Hilbert space is separable and isomorphic to $\\ell^2$, the Hilbert space of square-summable sequences. Each basis vector represents a polychromatic single-photon wave with quantized energy and a wavelet--like temporal dependence. Three versions of this basis are defined: Regular, incoming, and outgoing. The fields of the regular basis are smooth in both space and time. The incoming and outgoing fields are likewise smooth, except at the spatial origin. These results support and motivate the use of countable bases for both the theoretical description and the practical computation of light--matter interactions."}

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

The question that remains is how rare are elliptic differential operators whose lowest eigenvalue has this property. In this paper, the author proves that elliptic operators of the form $Δ_g^2 - div_g(T-λ_2 g^{-1}) d$, where $T$ is a negative semi-definite $(2,0)$-tensor field on $M$, and where $g^{-1}$ is the inverse metric tensor, have the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.

Monicity of the representation is assessed through a topological argument that allows us to perturbate a sufficiently close linear approximation into a suitable nice determinantal multiple of the initial RZ polynomial with the same rigidly convex set. The perturbation can be smoothly performed. This fact is what will allow us to determine that the multiple obtained respects the initial rigidly convex sets. This argument provides thus a full proof of the generalized Lax conjecture. However, an effective proof providing the representation in nice terms seems far from reachable at this moment."}

Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \\textit{separation} $δ_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample. That is, for a distribution satisfying a mild regularity condition, $h_n\\propto n^{-1/d}\\log^{1/d} (n)$ and $δ_n \\propto n^{-1/d}$.

Additionally, We show that the MLS approximant is smooth with high probability. Finally, we apply the stochastic MLS theory to manifold estimation. Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples.

The modal logics for the standard chronological and causal relations of the archetypal Minkowski spacetime have been classified. However only partial results have been achieved for the strict variant of the causal relation, also known as the after relation.\n  The present work continues this analysis towards arbitrary spacetimes. By utilizing the definition of the causal relations through causal paths, we can lift known results about the modal logics of Minkowski spacetime to general spacetimes. In particular, for the after relation, we show that a previously studied formula within the logics of Minkowski spacetime holds in arbitrary spacetimes. We introduce a related modal formula that demonstrates that the logic of two-dimensional spacetimes are more expressive than higher dimensional ones. Lastly, we study the interrelation between the logical properties and physical properties along the causal ladder, a classification of causal structures according to a hierarchy of physically relevant properties."}

The invariant density satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We reformulate this equation in terms of its score function (the gradient of the log-density), which is estimated directly from data via denoising score matching, thereby bypassing explicit density estimation. This learned score is then embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct the drift velocity field under the resulting score-based FP equation. The mesh-free nature of PINNs allows the framework to scale to higher dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in mesh-based methods. To address the ill-posedness of high-dimensional inverse problems, we recast the problem as a PDE-constrained optimization that seeks the minimal-energy velocity field. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this problem admits a unique solution that depends continuously on the score function. The constrained formulation is solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments on representative dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, an active swimmer in an anharmonic trap, and the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems, demonstrate that PINN-IMSM accurately recovers invariant measures and reconstructs faithful dynamical behavior for problems in up to five dimensions."}

Despite these advances, our understanding of the topology of moduli spaces of differentials remains limited, and many fundamental questions are still open.

In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance."}

In fact, the set $E$ has full measure inside a cube where the construction is supported. Moreover, we also construct a divergence-free velocity field $v \\in C_{t}C^ω_x$ for which the associated continuity equation admits two distinct solutions $μ^1$ and $μ^2$ which are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost every time, and start from the same initial datum $\\bar μ\\ll \\mathscr{L}^{d}$. Our construction introduces two novel ideas: (i) We introduce the notion of \"parallelization\", where at each time, the velocity field consists of simultaneous motion across multiple nested spatial scales. This differs from most explicit constructions in the literature on mixing or anomalous dissipation, where the velocity on different scales acts at separate times. This is crucial to cover the whole class of non-Osgood moduli of continuity. (ii) Inspired by a recent work of Bruè, Colombo and Kumar, we develop a new fixed-point framework that naturally incorporates the parallelization mechanism.

Moreover, we characterize the achievable computation rate and show that the proposed hierarchical constellations can compute R output functions with decoding error probability epsilon while the gap to the optimal computation rate scales as O(\\log_2(1/ε)/K) for independent source symbols, where K denotes the number of transmitters. Consequently, this gap vanishes as the network size grows, and the optimal rate is asymptotically attained.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a shielding mechanism based on variable-length block coding that mitigates noise-induced error propagation across constellation levels while preserving the superposition structure of the MAC. We show that the shielding technique improves reliability, yielding a gap that scales optimally as O(\\log_2\\ln{(1/ε)}), regardless of the source distribution.

Moreover, this approach preserves the original energy exactly at both the continuous and discrete levels, as opposed to a modified energy preserved by the auxiliary variable methods. Rigorous proofs are provided for the energy conservation and numerical accuracy of all derived schemes. The trade-off for these advantages is the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the Lagrange multiplier. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that the associated computational cost is generally not dominant, indicating that the new schemes retain computational efficiency comparable to the auxiliary variable-based schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed schemes."}

Motivated by a recent work [Berggren and Popović, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70(8), 6068-6075 (2024)], this paper further investigates the approach to generating CAZAC sequences by interleaving Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences with permutation polynomials (PPs). We propose one class of high-degree PPs over the integer ring Z N , and utilize them and their inverses to interleave ZC sequences for constructing CAZAC sequences. It is known that a CAZAC sequence can be extended to an equivalence class by five basic opertations. We further show that the obtained CAZAC sequences are not covered by the equivalence classes of ZC sequences and interleaved ZC sequences by quadratic PPs and their inverses, and prove the sufficiency of the conjecture by Berggren and Popović in the aforementioned work. In addition, we also evaluate the aperiodic auto-correlation of certain ZC sequences from quadratic PPs."}

We focus on the scenario where only two induced subgraphs are sampled, and characterize the sample size threshold for detection. At the information-theoretic level, we establish the sample complexity rates that are optimal up to constant factors over most parameter regimes, and the remaining gap is bounded by a subpolynomial factor. On the algorithmic side, we propose polynomial-time tests based on counting trees and bounded degree motifs, and identify the regimes where they succeed. Moreover, leveraging the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness that matches our achievable guarantees, showing that the proposed polynomial-time tests are rate-optimal.

To facilitate the latter, we utilize averaged measurements derived from multiple repeated observations. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the method in statistical prospective, establishing its stability and regularization properties under both stopping strategies. The algorithm begins with the computation of an initial reconstruction using any suitable techniques like Tikhonov regularization (Tik), filtered back projection (FBP) or total variation (TV), which is used as the foundation for generating the initial graph Laplacian. The reconstruction is made better step by step using an iterative process, during which the graph Laplacian is dynamically re-calibrated to reflect how the solution's structure is changing.

The approach consists of adding and subtracting suitable quadratic terms from one function to the other so as to redistribute strong convexity in the primal formulation and smoothness in the dual formulation. This yields an equivalent modified optimization problem in which each term has adjustable levels of strong convexity and smoothness. In this setting, the Peaceman--Rachford splitting method converges linearly to the solution of the modified problem with a convergence rate that can be optimized with respect to the introduced parameters. Upon returning to the original formulation, this procedure gives rise to a modified variant of PRS. The optimal linear rate established in this work is strictly better than the best rates previously available in the general setting. The practical performance of the method is illustrated through an academic example and applications in image processing."}

Toward this end, we delineate two broad classes of strategies for general higher-order time discretizations which we term spatial and temporal strategies. We provide a description of these two strategies and develop fourth-order time accurate schemes in the context of our Maxwell's system. However, our description can be used to prescribe similar fourth- or even higher-order time-integration methods for any linear (or quasi-linear) system of time-dependent partial differential equations. Our organizing principle in our proposed two strategies is to Taylor expand the unknown solution in time by assuming sufficient regularity. Then, in the spatial strategy, we use Maxwell's equations themselves to replace the fourth-order time derivatives in an appropriately truncated Taylor expansion with corresponding higher-order spatial derivatives. On the other hand, in the temporal strategy, we simply use higher-order finite difference schemes for the various higher-order time derivative terms in the truncated Taylor approximation. In both cases, we then defer to a standard finite element exterior calculus manner of compatible discretization for the spatial component of the Maxwell's solution. For our proposed schemes corresponding to the two strategies, we show that they are both stable and convergent and provide some validating numerical examples in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main contributions are in the development of the fourth-order time discretization methods that are energy conserving using our two outlined strategies and proofs of their convergence for semi- and full-discretizations of our three-field system of Maxwell's equations."}

Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching.

He calls these attached submanifolds. The Ricci curvatures of attached submanifolds coincide with the restrictions of the Ricci curvatures of ambient symmetric spaces.\n  We broaden Tamaru's construction by weakening the hypotheses on the ambient space, allowing a pseudo-Riemannian scalar product, and defining attached submanifolds in terms of root spaces. We demonstrate that in this setting, the Ricci curvature restriction property for attached submanifolds holds if and only if the submanifold satisfies an algebraic criterion that we call the Jacobi Star Condition. Like attached submanifolds of symmetric spaces, our attached submanifolds are minimal, and are only totally geodesic under hypotheses analogous to hypotheses in the symmetric space case.\n  Finally, we give an example of a solvmanifold that has an attached submanifold and is not a symmetric space, demonstrating that attached submanifolds are not unique to symmetric spaces."}

We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \\ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks."}

In this work, we address these shortcomings by shifting the focus from uncertainty in the weight space to uncertainty at the activation level, via Gaussian processes. More specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Process Activation function (GAPA) to capture neuron-level uncertainties. Our approach operates in a post-hoc manner, preserving the original mean predictions of the pre-trained neural network and thereby avoiding the underfitting issues commonly encountered in previous methods. We propose two methods. The first, GAPA-Free, employs empirical kernel learning from the training data for the hyperparameters and is highly efficient during training. The second, GAPA-Variational, learns the hyperparameters via gradient descent on the kernels, thus affording greater flexibility. Empirical results demonstrate that GAPA-Variational outperforms the Laplace approximation on most datasets in at least one of the uncertainty quantification metrics."}

Under a new assumption on the gradient of the objective function, weaker than global Lipschitz continuity from the origin, we establish that accumulation points of the outer iterates are basic feasible and cardinality-constrained Mordukhovich stationarity points. To ensure robustness and efficiency in finite-precision arithmetic, the algorithm incorporates several practical enhancements, including an enhanced line search strategy based on either backtracking or extrapolation, and four inexpensive diagonal Hessian approximations derived from differences of previous iterates and gradients or from eigenvalue-distribution information. Numerical experiments on a diverse benchmark of $30$ synthetic and data-driven test problems, including machine-learning datasets from the UCI repository and sparse symmetric instances with dimensions ranging from $10$ to $500$, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, robustness, and strong stationarity."}

Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost."}

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors.

In this article, we establish the asymptotic properties of the QTE estimator under rerandomization within a finite-population framework, without imposing any distributional or modeling assumptions on the covariates or outcomes.The estimator exhibits a non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution, represented as a linear combination of Gaussian and truncated Gaussian random variables.

This work is motivated by applications in model order reduction (MOR) of switched linear systems (SLS) in control form, where GLEs play a central role. We analyze how inaccuracies in the numerical solution of GLEs propagate through the MOR procedure and affect the accuracy and reliability of the reduced order model. Furthermore, the classical balanced-truncation error estimate for SLS is neither theoretically nor practically viable, as they rely on restrictive assumptions requiring several requiring several linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to be satisfied exactly by numerically computed solutions of the GLEs. To overcome these limitation, we propose a new MOR framework for SLS, called piecewise balanced reduction (PBR). The method is based on solving multiple GLEs and the construction of projection matrices that are piecewise constant in time to appropriately balance and subsequently reduce the SLS. We extend the standard balanced-truncation error bounds and demonstrate that the PBR formulation allows us to control the error arising from the inexact LMI. In addition, our new error bound accounts for the influence of the piecewise constant time-varying projection matrices. Altogether, this renders the PBR approach for SLS applicable to a broad and flexible class of SLS. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our theoretical results."}

Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.\n  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c>0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.\n  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent \"modular energy\"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics."}

Simulations show that the conventional formula can overstate uncertainty, while our approach delivers tighter intervals.

Along with this approximate confidence region, a theoretical quantification of the tightness of this approximation is developed, depending on the smoothness assumptions on the loss and score functions. The new notion of thickness is introduced for quantifying the discrepancy between the approximate confidence region and the full conformal one."}

However, their practical efficiency is often limited by the computational cost of solving the local saddle-point problems, especially when explicit matrix factorizations are not feasible. We explore a fully iterative, matrix-free-compatible approach to the local patch solve using $p$-multigrid techniques. We evaluate different local solver configurations: Braess-Sarazin and block-triangular preconditioners. Our numerical experiments suggest that the Braess-Sarazin approach is particularly resilient. We find that a single iteration of the local solver yields global convergence rates comparable to those obtained with exact local solvers, even on distorted meshes and in the presence of large viscosity jumps."}

Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Linéaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting. Finally, we establish a quantitative correspondence between the Hardy deficit on the manifold and an appropriate weighted Hardy deficit in Euclidean space, showing that each controls the other."}

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications."}

First, we establish precise bounds on the minimum rank distance of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes under two distinct parameter regimes. Specifically, when $n_{1}=k_{1}$ and $n_{2}=m<n_{1}n_{2}$, the minimum rank distance is exactly $n_{2}-k_{2}+1$. This yields a new family of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes, which are distinct from classical Gabidulin codes. For the case of $k_{1}\\leq n_{1},k_{2}\\leq n_{2},n_{1}n_{2}\\leq m$, the minimum rank distance $d$ of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes satisfies a tight upper and lower bound, i.e., $n_{2}-k_{2}+1 \\leq d \\leq (n_{1}-k_{1}+1)(n_{2}-k_{2}+1)$. Second, we introduce a new class of decodable rank-metric codes, namely Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker product (EGK) codes, which generalize the structure of Gabidulin-Kronecker product (GK) codes. We also propose a decoding algorithm that directly retrieves the codeword without recovering the error vector, thus improving efficiency. This algorithm achieves zero decoding failure probability when the error weight is within its correction capability. Third, we propose three enhanced variants of the RQC cryptosystem based on EGK codes, each offering a distinct trade-off between security and efficiency. For 128-bit security, all variants achieve significant reductions in public key size compared to the Multi-UR-AG (Bidoux et.al., IEEE IT, 2024) while ensuring zero decryption failure probability--a key security advantage over many existing rank-based schemes."}

Rigorous proofs of the approximation orders of the local numerical solution and the improved local numerical solution are presented.

In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

We develop a unified potential outcomes framework for generalized treatment effects with multiple outcomes in CRTs, accommodating both non-prioritized and prioritized outcome settings. The proposed cluster-pair and individual-pair causal estimands are defined through flexible pairwise contrast functions and explicitly account for potentially informative cluster sizes. We establish nonparametric estimation via weighted clustered U-statistics and derive efficient influence functions to construct covariate-adjusted estimators that integrate debiased machine learning with U-statistics.

This includes recent extensions to SINDy that enable the recovery of discrete delay differential equations, where delay terms are represented explicitly in the candidate library. However, such formulations cannot capture the distributed delays that naturally arise in biological, physical, and engineering systems. In the present work, we extend SINDy to identify distributed-delay differential equations by incorporating the Linear Chain Trick (LCT), which provides a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation representing the distributed memory effects. Hence, SINDy can operate in an augmented state space using conventional sparse regression while preserving a clear interpretation of delayed influences via the chain trick. From time-series data, the proposed method jointly infers the governing equations, the mean delay, and the dispersion of the underlying delay distribution. We numerically verify the method on several models with distributed delay, including the logistic growth model and a Hes1--mRNA gene regulatory network model. We show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs distributed delay dynamics, remains robust under noise and sparse sampling, and provides a transparent, data-driven approach for discovering nonlinear systems with distributed-delay."}

The case of one soliton was previously established and in particular there is no blow-up. We consider the case of $J\\geq2$ solitons, where we expect only infinite-time blow-up.\n  We are able to identify three different scenarios, where we have a continuous-in-time resolution with an unexpected universal blow-up speed. The first one is when one scaling is much larger than the others. In this case, one bubble does not concentrate (hence stabilize) and the other bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-2/(N-6)}$ together with strong sign constraints. Next, assuming we are not in the first scenario, we establish a non-degenerate condition on the positions of bubbles to obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-4)}$. The last case we consider is a degenerate, but not too much degenerate, scenario. Here again, we obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-3)}$. This last rate has not been discovered before. Our theorem covers the case of four or less bubbles and we provide the construction of examples.

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments."}

This extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Cekić and T.Lefeuvre (2023). Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or Steklov operator) determines at the boundary both a magnetic potential, up to gauge, and an electric potential, provided the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential.

We address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate a fixed annotation budget between ground-truth labels and pairwise preferences in AI. Our solution, grounded in semi-parametric inference, casts the budget allocation problem as a monotone missing data framework. Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution. This work provides a principled and statistically efficient approach for budget-constrained learning in modern AI. Simulations and real-data analysis demonstrate the practical benefits and superior performance of our proposed method."}

While Peres's positive-partial-transpose criterion provides a simple and powerful test for entanglement, a comparably elegant spectral criterion for detecting EPR steering remains an open challenge. In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues. We prove that this criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for steerability for the Werner state, all two-qubit pure states, all two-qubit rank-2 states. Furthermore, we validate the criterion for higher-rank states (rank-3 and rank-4) and show that the results align with known steering inequalities. Our findings suggest a more unified framework for detecting quantum nonlocality via partial transposition and open avenues for further theoretical and numerical investigations into steering detection."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel class of kernel-based tests by embedding the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and construct test statistics using sample splitting, projection, and self-normalization (SN) techniques. Through a new conditioning technique, we demonstrate that our test statistics have pivotal limiting null distributions under absolute regularity and mild moment assumptions.

A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems."}

The mechanical adjustment provides wide-angle coverage but suffers from slow response, while the electronic tuning enables rapid beam reconfiguration but with limited angular range. To effectively combine their complementary advantages, we propose to jointly design both mechanical and electronic configurations to maximize the average sum-rate of users via a two-timescale optimization approach, in which the array positions are optimized on the long timescale according to large-scale user distribution statistics, and the pattern selection vectors are optimized on the short timescale to enable fast beam alignment based on the instantaneous user locations. An alternating optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo sampling method is developed to solve the problem efficiently.

By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states.

The approach extracts Lyapunov-like finite-time contraction information directly from solver trajectories via step norms and step-log ratios, aggregates the resulting profiles over micro-launch ensembles, and ranks parameter candidates using two compact scores: the stability minimum S_min and the stability moment S_mom.

This extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Cekić and T.Lefeuvre (2023). Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or Steklov operator) determines at the boundary both a magnetic potential, up to gauge, and an electric potential, provided the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum.

In this work, we analyze the color code model on an infinite lattice within the quasi-local $C^{*}$-algebra framework, using a cone-localized Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) analysis. We classify its irreducible anyon superselection sectors and construct explicit string operators that generate anyonic excitations from the ground state.

These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like an Erdős--Rényi model, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for subgraph counts [CD13]. However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erdős--Rényi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $Θ(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. \n  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a \"triangle-free\" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well. Along the way, we also prove a bound on the marginal edge probability under the ERGM via a new bootstrapping argument. Such a bound has already appeared [FLSW25], but again only in the subcritical regime and using a different proof strategy."}

In cases where the Kolmogorov $N$-width decays fast enough, it is effective to approximate the solution as a sum of $N$ separable terms, each being the product of a parameter-dependent coefficient and a space-dependent function. This leads to reduced-order models with $N$ degrees of freedom and complexity of order ${\\mathcal O}(N^3)$.\n  However, when the $N$-width decays slowly, $N$ must be large to achieve acceptable accuracy, making cubic complexity prohibitive. The linear complexity measure in terms of Kolmogorov width must be replaced by the Gelfand width, with its associated sensing number. Recent nonlinear approaches based on this notion decompose the $N$ coordinates into two groups: $n$ free variables and $\\overline{n}$ dependent variables, where the latter are nonlinear functions of the former ($N= n+\\overline n$). Several works have focused on cases where these $\\overline{n}$ functions are homogeneous quadratic forms of the $n$ variables, with optimization strategies for choosing $n$ given a target accuracy.\n  A rigorous analysis of the local sensing number is carried out, showing that $n = p$ is optimal and appropriate, at least locally, around a reference point. In practical scenarios involving wide parameter ranges, the condition $p\\le n \\le p + k$ (with $k$ small) is valid and more robust from continuity arguments. Additionally, the assumption of a quadratic mapping, while justified in a local sense, becomes insufficient. More expressive nonlinear mappings-including those using machine learning-become necessary. This work contributes a theoretical foundation for such strategies and highlights the need for further investigations to push back the Kolmogorov Barrier."}

We assume that the instantaneous knowledge of the transmit signal at the sensing receiver is not available, and the sensing receiver only has knowledge of the statistical properties of the received signal. Unlike prior research that focuses on power allocation or optimal beamforming design for ISAC, we emphasize the inadequacy of the Cramér-Rao Bound (and its variant) in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, particularly in passive sensing scenarios. Due to severe path loss and other impairments, the received sensing SNR is often significantly lower than that of direct Line-of-Sight communication, making CRB-based performance evaluation unreliable. To address this, we adopt the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for Angle of Arrival estimation, which provides a more meaningful lower bound on estimation error. We derive analytical expressions for the ZZB and the achievable ergodic communication rate as functions of SNR. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the pareto-front between communication and sensing performance, demonstrating why ZZB serves as a better metric in low sensing SNR ISAC where traditional CRB-based approaches fail."}

The argument follows the constructive truncation scheme: principal truncations are oscillatory, hence have simple positive spectra, and a suitable choice of initial conditions ensures positivity of the Christoffel coefficients and of the resulting discrete matrix-valued measures supported at the truncation eigenvalues. The main difficulty is the passage to the limit of these discrete measures beyond the bounded case.

The current work applies discrete-time optimal control theory to two models of species augmentation for predator-prey relationships. In discrete-time models, the order in which events occur can give different qualitative results. Two models representing different orders of events of optimal augmentation timing are considered. In one model, the population grows and predator-prey action occurs before the translocation of reserve species for augmentation. In the second model, the augmentation happens first and is followed by growth and then predator-prey action.\n  The reserve and target populations are subjected to strong Allee effects. The optimal augmentation models employed in this work aim to maximize the prey (target population) and reserve population at the final time and minimize the associated cost at each time step. Numerical simulations in the two models are conducted using the discrete version of the forward-backward sweep method and the sequential quadratic programming iterative method, respectively. The simulation results show different population levels in the two models under varying parameter scenarios. Objective functional values showing percentage increases with optimal controls are calculated for each simulation.

The formulation extends the classical Müller equation to composite structures through the global multi-trace method. The key ingredient enabling this extension is the use of the Stratton-Chu representation in complementary region, also known as the extinction property, which augments the off-diagonal blocks of the interior representation operator. The resulting block system is composed entirely of second-kind operators. A Petrov-Galerkin (mixed) discretization using Rao-Wilton-Glisson trial functions and Buffa-Christiansen test functions is employed, yielding linear systems that remain well conditioned on dense meshes and at low frequencies without the need for additional stabilization. This reduces computational costs associated with matrix-vector multiplications and iterative solving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the method in computing field traces and derived quantities."}

Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling.

To capture dynamic maritime environment, a near-ocean-surface channel model is developed considering the impact of sea waves. In addition, a wave energy harvesting (EH) system is designed to self-power IoT sensors for data acquisition, processing, and transmission. To support real-time adaptation, channel state information is continuously measured to optimize RIS reflection parameters and maximize multi-user communication rates.

However, prevailing coded caching schemes typically assume that a user's cached content is inaccessible to others, overlooking the risk of file privacy leakage due to attacks targeting the cache itself. In this paper, we propose a secure coded caching scheme for D2D networks that guarantees both file privacy and secure delivery. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves order-optimal performance when the file size is sufficiently large and the cache memory is ample."}

The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp."}

The metric is introduced through a dynamic formulation that combines transport and source costs along solutions of a nonconservative continuity equation, where mass variation is constrained to occur along a fixed strictly positive reference direction. We show that geodesics associated with this metric exhibit a non-locality property: almost every time, they are supported on the whole state space, independently of the choice of endpoints. Moreover, along optimal curves, the source term displays a characteristic temporal profile, with mass creation occurring at early times and subsequent decay as the curve approaches the target measure. As an application of this property, we compare our metric with the shift-transport distance and prove that the latter is always bounded above by our metric. Finally, we establish a Kantorovich-type duality formula in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi subsolutions, which provides a characterization of the metric and highlights the role of the momentum associated with geodesic curves."}

To resolve this, we propose a distributed diffeomorphic coverage control framework for the multi-agent system (MAS) in such surfaces. First, we establish a distributed poly-annulus conformal mapping that transforms arbitrary poriferous surfaces into a multi-hole disk. Leveraging this topological equivalence, a collision-free sectorial partition mechanism is designed in the multi-hole disk, which rigorously induces strictly connected subregions and workload balance on the poriferous surfaces. This mechanism utilizes a buffer-based sequence mechanism to ensure strict topological safety when bypassing obstacles. Furthermore, a pull-back Riemannian metric is constructed to define the length metric that encodes safety constraints. Based on this metric, a distributed gradient-based control law is synthesized to drive agents toward optimal configurations, ensuring simultaneous obstacle avoidance and coverage optimization. Theoretical analyses guarantee the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the partition dynamics and the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations confirm the reachability and robustness of the proposed coverage algorithm, offering a scalable solution for distributed coverage in poriferous surfaces."}

We investigate two widely adopted precoding strategies: (i) blockdiagonalization (BD) at the transmitter combined with maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers, and (ii) zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.\n  Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%. These gains are further amplified under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, where VCC's ability to offload interference mitigation to the receivers ensures robust performance even in the face of degraded CSI quality and elevated acquisition costs."}

Our decoder combines classical inactivation decoding, which integrates peeling with symbolic guessing, with a new dual peeling procedure. In the dual peeling stage, we perform row operations on the stabilizer matrix to efficiently reveal stabilizer generators and their linear combinations whose support lies entirely on the erased set. Each such stabilizer identified allows us to freely fix a bit in its support without affecting the logical state of the decoded result. This removes one degree of freedom that would otherwise require a symbolic guess, reducing the number of inactivated variables and decreasing the size of the final linear system that must be solved. We further show that dual peeling combined with standard peeling alone, without inactivation, is sufficient to achieve ML for erasure decoding of surface codes. Simulations across several QLDPC code families confirm that our decoder matches ML logical failure performance while significantly reducing the complexity of inactivation decoding, including more than a 20% reduction in symbolic guesses for the B1 lifted product code at high erasure rates."}

Minimal sufficient query families form the bases of a matroid; the induced distinguishing dimension is well-defined and links to zero-error source coding via graph entropy.

The charge, the momentum, and the energy of this solution are conserved. We investigate the dynamics of the soliton subjected to several potentials: a ramp, a harmonic, and a periodic potential. We develop a Collective Coordinates Theory by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, and momentum, are functions of time. We insert the ansatz into the Lagrangian density of the model, integrate over space and obtain a Lagrangian as a function of the collective coordinates. This Lagrangian differs only in the charge and mass with the Lagrangian of a collective coordinates theory for the Gross-Neveu equation. Thus the soliton dynamics in the ABS spinor model is qualitatively the same as in the Gross-Neveu equation, but quantitatively it differs. These results of the collective coordinates theory are confirmed by simulations, i.e., by numerical solutions for solitons of the ABS spinor model, subjected to the above potentials."}

This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for determining the optimal proportions of barn-type houses with respect to minimizing the external surface area while satisfying constraints of either fixed volume or fixed floor area. Closed-form solutions for the optimal width, length, and height are derived as explicit functions of the roof slope, together with formulas for the minimal achievable surface. A recently introduced dimensionless compactness measure is also calculated, allowing quantitative assessment of how far a given design deviates from the theoretical optimum. The methodology is applied to case studies of three existing houses, showing that while some designs deviate significantly from optimal compactness, others already closely approximate it. The results confirm that theoretical optimization can lead to meaningful reductions in construction costs and energy demand. To support practical implementation, two original freely available software tools were developed, enabling architects and engineers to perform optimization analyses."}

We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism.

A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques.

Such maximin design problems abound in statistical applications and present unique theoretical and computational challenges. Building on the differential structure of the $2$-Wasserstein space, we derive explicit formulas for the Wasserstein gradient of the $E$-optimality criterion in the simple-eigenvalue case. For higher multiplicities, we propose a Wasserstein steepest ascent direction and show that it can be computed exactly via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We develop particle approximations that connect infinite-dimensional flows with finite-dimensional optimization, and provide approximation guarantees for empirical measures. Our framework extends naturally to constrained designs via projected Wasserstein gradient flows.

We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces."}

These are not \\textit{rare events} and cannot be evaluated using traditional disruption models focused on infrequent events. Instead, sustained volatility induces opportunistic behavior, as firms repeatedly reconfigure partners in absence of long-term contracts, often due to trust deficits. The resulting web of transient relationships forms opportunistic supply chains (OSCs). To capture OSC evolution, we develop an integrated mathematical framework combining a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to represent stochastic price volatility, a Bayesian learning model to describe adaptive belief updates regarding partner reliability, and a Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG) network model for endogenous changes in network structure. This framework is implemented in an agent-based simulation to examine how volatility, trust, and network structure jointly shape SC resilience. Our modeling approach identifies critical volatility threshold; a tipping point beyond which the network shifts from a stable, link-preserving regime to a fragmented regime marked by rapid relationship dissolution. We analytically establish monotonic effects of volatility on profitability, trust, and link activation; derive formal stability conditions and volatility-driven phase transitions, and show how these mechanisms shape node importance and procurement behavior. These theoretical mechanisms are illustrated through computational experiments reflecting industry behaviors in fast fashion, electronics, and perishables. Overall, our contribution is to develop an integrated GBM-Bayesian-LOLOG framework to analyze OSC stability and our model can be extended to other OSCs including humanitarian, pharmaceutical, and poultry networks."}

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance.

Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Linéaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting. Finally, we establish a quantitative correspondence between the Hardy deficit on the manifold and an appropriate weighted Hardy deficit in Euclidean space, showing that each controls the other."}

Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \\textit{separation} $δ_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample.

Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples.

Koopman-based MPC enables QP-based control of nonlinear systems by lifting the dynamics to a higher-dimensional linear representation. However, existing approaches rely on single-step EDMD. Consequently, prediction errors may accumulate over long horizons when the EDMD operator is applied recursively. Moreover, the multi-step prediction loss is nonconvex with respect to the single-step EDMD operator, making long-horizon model identification particularly challenging. This paper proposes a multi-step EDMD framework that directly learns the condensed multi-step state-control mapping required for Koopman-MPC, thereby bypassing explicit identification of the lifted system matrices and subsequent model condensation. The resulting identification problem admits a convex least-squares formulation. We further show that the problem decomposes across prediction horizons and state coordinates, enabling parallel computation and row-wise $\\ell_1$-regularization for automatic dictionary pruning. A non-asymptotic finite-sample analysis demonstrates that, unlike one-step EDMD, the proposed method avoids error compounding and yields error bounds that depend only on the target multi-step mapping.

To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions. In the process, we discuss the extension of a known connection between contextuality and no-broadcasting to the continuous-variable scenario, and prove structural results regarding fixed points of infinite-dimensional entanglement breaking channels."}

Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites.

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications."}

Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area. Based on this codebook, an efficient optimization approach is developed to minimize the Cram\\acute{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{e}}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and obtain the optimal HRPA geometries for angular sensing within a given area. Numerical results show that the HRPA reduces the angle estimation error by more than 50% across the full three-dimensional sphere when compared with a conventional uniform planar array of the same size. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the potential of HRPA for integrated sensing and communication systems."}

This paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework to characterize privacy leakage in distributed nonlinear aggregation under a joint adversary that combines passive (honest-but-curious) corruption and eavesdropping over communication channels.\n  We cover two broad classes of nonlinear aggregates: order-based operators (maximum/minimum and top-$K$) and robust aggregation (median/quantiles and trimmed mean). We first derive fundamental lower bounds on leakage that hold without sacrificing accuracy, thereby identifying the minimum unavoidable information revealed by the computation and the transcript. We then propose simple yet effective privacy-preserving distributed algorithms, and show that with appropriate randomized initialization and parameter choices, our proposed approaches can attach the derived optimal bounds for the considered operators. Extensive experiments validate the tightness of the bounds and demonstrate that network topology and key algorithmic parameters (including the stepsize) govern the observed leakage in line with the theoretical analysis, yielding actionable guidelines for privacy-preserving nonlinear aggregation."}

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem."}

This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance.

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

We provide numerical experiments to test the resolution and robustness of the Born approximation in different situations. Finally, we show how it can be used as the starting point of an algorithm for reconstructing a conductivity from its DtN map."}

Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty."}

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TSP", "summary": "Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems."}

To overcome the constant-factor optimality loss inherent to earlier literature, and to circumvent intrinsic representational barriers of adaptive policies, our approach is driven by the following innovations:\n  -- The block-responsive paradigm: We introduce block-responsive policies, a new class of decision-making strategies, selecting ordered sets (blocks) of applicants rather than single individuals, while still allowing for internal reactivity.\n  -- Adaptivity and efficiency: We prove that these policies can nearly match the performance of general adaptive policies while utilizing polynomially-sized decision trees.\n  -- Efficient construction: By developing a recursive enumeration-based framework, we resolve the problematic ``few-positions'' regime, bypassing a fundamental hurdle that hindered previous approaches."}

However, the mechanistic pathways underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that pattern formation in fish development requires specific pigment cell interactions. Motivated by experimental observations of pigmentation alterations following contaminant exposure, we investigate how pollutants influence pigment cell self-organization using a continuum reaction-diffusion-advection framework. The model incorporates nonlocal Morse-type kernels to describe short- and long-range interactions among melanophores and xanthophores. Our results show that perturbations to the strengths of adhesion or repulsion can drive transitions between stripes, spots, and mixed patterns, reproducing phenotypes characteristic of fish pigmentation mutants. In particular, homotypic interactions are sensitive to contamination, leading to pronounced changes in melanophore density and resulting pigmentation patterns. Time-dependent simulations indicate that pigment changes from early short-term contaminant exposure may be recoverable, whereas prolonged exposure can lead to sustained pigment loss. In a growing fish, contaminant-induced changes in cell-cell interactions directly influence stripe formation rate, stripe number, and pigmentation levels. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanistic link between experimentally observed pigmentation alterations and the changes in spatial patterns of adult fish."}

These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like an Erdős--Rényi model, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for subgraph counts [CD13]. However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erdős--Rényi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $Θ(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. \n  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a \"triangle-free\" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well.

While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost."}

While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on limited-angle and single-shot computerized tomography problems, highlighting improvements in reconstruction accuracy, memory efficiency, and computational cost."}

This allows us to construct in broad generality the efficient Gaussian involved in the classical minimax and convolution theorems to establish information lower bounds, that are typically achieved by Bayesian algorithms thus showing optimality of these methods. We illustrate our results on time-evolution PDE models for reaction-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations."}

Yu"], "title": "A uniformity principle for spatial matching", "categories": ["math.PR", "cs.DS", "econ.GN", "math.OC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \\ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks."}

We introduce a local solution framework, termed \"covariant tomography,\" that uses geometric decomposition to reconstruct interior fields and currents within star-shaped open subsets. The core of our approach involves decomposing differential forms into exact and antiexact components, enabling the formulation of the parallel transport equation via a homotopy operator. We examine three primary extension techniques - radial, heat equation, and harmonic - to map boundary values into the interior, noting that the choice of extension directly influences the regularity of the resulting currents. The proposed methodology provides a systematic way to identify the realizability of boundary values and offers solutions for both current and gauge field tomography. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this framework through illustrative examples in low-dimensional spaces and electromagnetic potential reconstruction in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$."}

This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness."}

The sought topology is represented by a stationary phase-field that represents a smooth indicator function. The fluid equations are approximated by a porous media approach and are time-dependent. In the latter aspect, the considered problem formulation extends earlier work.\n  We prove that if the time horizon tends to infinity, minima of the time-dependent problem converge towards minima of the corresponding stationary problem. To do so, a convergence rate with respect to the time horizon, of the values of the objective functional, is analytically derived. This allowed us to prove that the solution to the time-dependent problem converges to a phase-field, as the time horizon goes to infinity, which is proven to be a minimizer for the stationary problem. We validate our results by numerical investigation."}

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

To prove this, we develop a Floquet theory that captures the analytic variation of surface states. The main idea consists of reformulating the eigenvalue problem for surface states as a Fredholm problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map."}

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines."}

This demographic and immunological transition creates an urgent policy question regarding how adult vaccination should be prioritized under resource constraints. We evaluated three adult vaccination scenarios targeting low seroprevalence age groups (S1) 20 to 39 years, (S2) 40 to 59 years, and (S3) 20 to 59 years. Using an age structured dynamic transmission model calibrated to Korean data, we derived dynamically feasible vaccination allocation trajectories under realistic capacity constraints using an optimal control framework and linked these trajectories to long term transmission model simulations. We conducted DALY based cost effectiveness analyses over a lifetime horizon from both healthcare system and societal perspectives, and characterized uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Robustness was examined using one way sensitivity analyses. In the base case, S2 consistently yields the most favorable and robust cost effectiveness profile under both perspectives, with the lowest ICER. S3 achieved the largest reduction in DALYs but requires substantially higher incremental costs, resulting in a higher ICER than S2. S1 produces the smallest DALY reduction and is the least efficient strategy. PSA and CEACs confirm that S2 remains the preferred option across most willingness to pay ranges. S2 offers the most balanced and robustly cost effective strategy in Korea, capturing substantial mortality reduction while limiting additional program costs. S3 may be justified when higher budgets or willingness to pay thresholds are acceptable, but S2 provides the clearest value for money under epidemiological and economic conditions."}

For an initial proper curve in the plane whose ends are radial lines but which is otherwise arbitrarily wild, we use the Harnack inequality to give an explicit time by which the curve shortening flow evolution must become graphical. This gives a new instance of delayed parabolic regularity. The Harnack inequality also gives estimates describing how a polar graphical flow with radial ends settles down to an expanding solution. Finally, we relate our Harnack inequality to Hamilton's by identifying a pointwise curvature estimate implied by both Harnack inequalities in the special case of convex flows."}

However, as they get larger, they present computational challenges for classical solvers within practical time limits. Quantum annealers can, in principle, accelerate the solution of problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization instances, but their limited scale currently prevents achieving practical speedups. Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger problems. In this work, a hardware-agnostic Benders' decomposition algorithm and a series of enhancements with the goal of taking the most advantage of quantum computing are presented. The decomposition consists of a master problem with integer variables, which is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved with a quantum annealer, and a linear subproblem solved by a classical computer. The enhancements consist, among others, of different embedding processes that substantially reduce the pre-processing time of the embedding computation without compromising solution quality, a conservative handling of cut constraints, and a stopping criterion that accounts for the limited size of current quantum computers and their heuristic nature. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked against classical approaches using a D-Wave quantum annealer for a scalable family of transmission network expansion planning problems."}
