The aim is to reconstruct the moving orbit from the\ntangential components of magnetic fields taken at a finite number of\nobservation points. The distance function between each observation point and\nthe moving point source is computed by solving a nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equation with an initial value. This ODE system only involves the\nmeasurement data from the tangential trace of the magnetic field at observation\npoints. As a consequence, the dynamical measurement data recorded at four\nnon-coplanar points are sufficient to reconstruct the orbit function. A\nLipschitz stability is established for the inverse problem, and numerical\nexperiments are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. Numerical examples have shown that the reconstructed error depends\nlinearly on the noise level and that the wave speed is a critical factor\naffecting the relative error."}

We prove that, under a key structural\nassumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong\nsolution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\\rm d} M_t =\n\\nu_\\theta(t, M_t) {\\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function\n$\\nu_\\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the\nalgebraic constraint $g_\\theta(t, M_t, \\nu_\\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where\n$g_\\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic\ncalculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic\ncase, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The\ncharacter of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously\ndetermined by the learned parameters $\\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation\nfor models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature."}

This bound significantly\nimproves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we\nprove our $\\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound.\nOur proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities\nthat exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a\nvector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and\n(3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control\nhigher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for\neigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense\ngraphs."}

It is argued these 'transferable voting'\nsystems in fact operate to balance competing desiderata that attempt to distil\nthe common notions of 'majority rule' and 'voter choice'. Among positive\ncharacteristics of AV is that its outcome is always a majority runoff between\ntwo candidates with substantial voter support, and that a Condorcet winner who\ngains at least one-third of votes is always elected.

A detailed analysis of non-monotonicity paradoxes in three-way\ncontests is provided, aided by a two-dimensional spatial model where each\ncandidate has a one-in-four probability of gaining an absolute majority of\nprimary votes while there is a similar one-in-four probability that no\ncandidate wins a majority. On such a model it is shown non-monotonicities are\nlatent in less than 3.5% of election scenarios (and conjectured to be less than\n3%), and the close link between non-monotonicities and Condorcet cycles and\ninstabilities is studied in more detail.

The NBM\nis defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with\nrespect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural\nExpectation Operator, $\\varepsilon^\\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\\theta$ is parameterized by a\nneural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical\nNBM, which we define as a continuous $\\varepsilon^\\theta$-martingale with zero\ndrift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural\nassumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong\nsolution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\\rm d} M_t =\n\\nu_\\theta(t, M_t) {\\rm d} W_t$.

We develop the stochastic\ncalculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic\ncase, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The\ncharacter of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously\ndetermined by the learned parameters $\\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation\nfor models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature."}

We prove convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal steady\nstate with explicit error bounds. To reduce the\n  computational burden of repeated linearization operations, we further develop\na multi-timescale variant where linearization\n  updates occur at a slower timescale than optimization iterations, achieving\nsignificant computational savings while preserving\n  convergence guarantees. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated via numerical simulations of a realistic\n  wind farm control problem. The results validate both the theoretical\nconvergence predictions and the expected computational\n  advantages of our multi-timescale formulation."}

Half a century ago, for equinumerous sides,\nKnuth demonstrated existence of preferences for which there are exponentially\nmany stable matchings, and he posed a problem of evaluating an expected number\nof stable matchings when the preferences are uniformly random and independent.\nIt was shown later by Pittel that this expectation is quite moderate,\nasymptotic to $e^{-1}n\\log n$, $n$ being the number of agents on each side.

We seek the optimal\ncombination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel\nstrength from transmitter to receiver. Unlike many existing works that heavily\nrely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical\napproach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind\nconfiguration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key\nfeatures of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS)\ndata via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a\nwindfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a\nnontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active\nsensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel\nestimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless\ncommunication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is\nthe RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is\nverified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band.

Specifically,\nwe establish uniform bounds in $L^\\infty([0,T]; H^1(\\R) \\cap L^\\infty(\\R))$.\nThese are established via an energy method for the excess mass to secure the\n$L^\\infty$ bound, and a novel energy estimate for the $H^1$ norm that\ncritically leverages the stability condition. These bounds provide the\ncompactness necessary to pass to the singular limit, showing convergence to a\nMcKean-Vlasov SDE with a singular, density-dependent diffusion coefficient.\nThis work opens a new path to analyzing singular systems and provides a\nconstructive theory for a class of interactions that present significant\nchallenges to classical techniques."}

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios.

It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence.

Here, we propose an alternative measure for characterising how\nthe dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as defined by one set of samples is\nexpressed in another, \\textit{cross mutual information}. We present a\ncomprehensive set of simulation studies sampling data with $X$-$Y$ dependencies\nto explore this measure. Finally, we discuss how this relates to measures of\nmodel fit in linear regression, and some future applications in neuroimaging\ndata analysis."}

Despite its significance in numerous\napplications, theory on the effectiveness of SSDA remains largely unexplored,\nparticularly in scenarios involving various types of source-target\ndistributional shifts. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based\non structural causal models (SCMs) which allows us to analyze and quantify the\nperformance of SSDA methods when labeled target data is limited. Within this\nframework, we introduce three SSDA methods, each having a fine-tuning strategy\ntailored to a distinct assumption about the source and target relationship.\nUnder each assumption, we demonstrate how extending an unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) method to SSDA can achieve minimax-optimal target performance\nwith limited target labels.

In this work we contribute an approach\nto sparse learning under such group structure, that does not require prior\ninformation on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian\ngeometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and\nproceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively\ncomputed via a heat-flow-based local network dynamics. The proposed penalty\ninterpolates between the lasso and the group lasso penalties, the runtime of\nthe heat-flow dynamics being the interpolating parameter.

This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model\nfor two-dimensional PDEs.

Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for\nPDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs,\nPDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has\nsmaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples.

To\nreduce computational cost, we mitigate the global nonlinearity through a\none-way coupling of the multiscale and mixed/dimensional models with a reduced\n0D model for the drug metabolism.

Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived\nclosed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher\nlevels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems. In this\ncontext, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in\nthe number of parallel channels.

Yet,\ninspired by numerical experiments, we argue that all second-order critical\npoints become global minimizers when the problem is relaxed by optimizing over\nconfigurations in dimension $k > \\ell$. Specifically, we show this for two\nsettings, both when all pairwise distances are known: (1) for arbitrary ground\ntruth points, and $k= O(\\sqrt{\\ell n})$, and: (2) for isotropic random ground\ntruth points, and $k = O(\\ell + \\log n)$. To prove these results, we identify\nand exploit key properties of the linear map which sends inner products to\nsquared distances."}

Toward this goal, it is natural for agents to seek\nprotection against deviations around the emergent behavior itself, which is\nultimately impacted by all the above sources of uncertainty.

To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field\nintegrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which\nleverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only,\nthereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic\ncommunication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive\nmechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the\nNF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The\nproposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users\nand extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization\nproblem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing\nquality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating\noptimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three\nsub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio.\nBeamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA\npositioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)\nalgorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection\nsearch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nhigher data rates and better privacy preservation."}
