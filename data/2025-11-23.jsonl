Motivated by the requirements of the OpInf methodology, we reformulate the matrix equations into a structured representation that explicitly shows the parameter dependence in polynomial form. This reformulation is crucial for efficient model reduction. This approach constructs reduced-order models via regression on solution snapshots, bypassing the need for expensive full-order operators and thus overcoming the primary bottlenecks of intrusive methods in high-dimensional contexts. Numerical experiments confirm their accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that our work is a scalable and practical solution for parameter-dependent matrix equations."}

Within this framework, the number of neurons serves as both the regularization parameter and iteration number. We demonstrate that for data with high noise levels, a small network architecture is sufficient to obtain a stable solution, whereas a larger architecture may compromise stability due to overfitting. Furthermore, under standard assumptions in regularization theory, we derive convergence rate results for neural networks in the context of variational regularization.

When the projective space is the plane, this is trivial. For projective 3 space this problem was solved independently by Diaz and by Giuffrida in 1986. They showed that two curves achieving the maximum number of intersection points have to be rational curves on a smooth surface of minimal degree, i.e., a quadric surface. Note that these curves are far from being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. In contrast, Hartshorne and Miró-Roig addressed this problem in 2015 for space curves under the assumption that the curves are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), introducing very deep techniques and obtaining very different results from Diaz and Giuffrida. Diaz and Giuffrida also gave initial results in dimensions greater than 3. Here we continue this study for dimension 4. We introduce a number B defined in terms of the degrees of the curves and prove that when both curves lie on a surface of minimal degree (thus a cubic surface) then the number of points of intersection is at most B. Moreover, we conjecture that B is always an upper bound and we prove this conjecture in many cases, including when at least one of the curves is ACM. Our approach focuses on the genera of the curves and their union. In addition we define a second number B' in terms of the degrees and the genus of the union which we can show bounds the number of points of intersection above, and we use a variety of methods to study how B and B' compare."}

Our proof equally applies to both geometries and is based on the following two ingredients: the complete integrability of ILW and the normal form method. More precisely, by making use of the Lax pair structure and the perturbation determinant for ILW, recently introduced by Harrop-Griffths, Killip, and Vişan (2025), we first establish weakly uniform (in small depth parameters) equicontinuity in $L^2$ of solutions to the scaled ILW, providing a control on the high frequency part of solutions.

This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF)."}

In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra."}

Our primary contribution is the derivation of two Dudley-type maximal inequalities for expected empirical processes that remove restrictive assumptions such as light tails and uniform boundedness of the function class. These inequalities enlarge the scope of empirical process theory available for statistical learning and nonparametric estimation. Exploiting the new bounds, we establish robustness guarantees for deep ReLU network estimators in Huber and quantile regression. In particular, we prove a unified non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian concentration bound that remains valid even under infinite-variance noise and provide a comprehensive analysis of non-asymptotic robustness for deep Huber estimators across all noise regimes. For deep quantile regression, we provide the first non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian bounds without requiring moment assumptions. As an additional application, our framework yields estimation error bounds for nonparametric least-squares estimators that simultaneously accommodate infinite-variance noise, non-Donsker function classes, and approximation error. Moreover, unlike prior approaches based on specialized multiplier processes, our framework extends to broader empirical risk minimization problems, including the nonparametric generalized linear models and the ``set-structured'' models."}

For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities."}

This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting."}

The result obtained in R. Figari, H. Saberbaghi, and A. Teta, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57(5), 2024, for zero angular momentum is recovered here as a special case, and the analysis is extended to all angular momenta. In this setting, the resonant heavy-light interactions are modeled as point interactions, under the assumption of either exchange symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to the positions of the delta centers. Within this framework, we prove that in the unitary limit the Efimov spectrum depends solely on the mass ratio and particle statistics; that is, the so-called three-body parameter is absent. We also provide a condition ensuring that the spectrum contains no nonEfimov eigenvalues. Furthermore, we study the system away from the unitary limit and show that the spatial size of the weakest bound state near the threshold is approximately 2.8 times the two-body scattering length, in contrast to the common assumption that these two scales coincide. Finally, we compute Bargmann bound for the number of bound states and obtain a sharper estimate than the results in the literature."}

In the following, we propose bias corrected estimators based on the idea in \\cite{Cheng2018} which still have an appealing structure, but have a bias of smaller order as in multiple regression settings while the variance is of the same order of magnitude as before.

If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of \"symbols\" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as \"human intuition.\" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the \"normalized centroid distance\" method derived from information compression perspective."}

To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing."}

While this model is significantly more accurate, it is also computationally more expensive. To speed up computations, the micro-macro method may be used. The micro-macro method switches between two models of varying levels of detail allowing for larger stable time steps. In this paper we formulate the micro-macro method for shallow water moment equations.

In the FVA setting, we introduce a sensitivity analysis technique that is novel even for smooth PDEs.

We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.\n  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction.

In their work, the conditioning framework was constructed using the exponential distribution. Although further generalization was proposed, challenges emerged in deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for valid joint survival functions. The present study achieves such generalization, extending the conditioning framework to encompass distributional families whose marginal densities may exhibit unimodality and skewness, moving beyond distributional families whose marginal densities are non-increasing. The resulting models are fully specified through closed-form expressions for their moments, with simulations implemented using either a copula-based procedure or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.\n  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data."}

We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families.

In this paper, we study the general problem of covariate adjustment, effect estimation, and statistical inference when balancing features are constructed or selected with the aid of outcome information from the data. We propose cross-balancing, a method that uses sample splitting to separate the error in feature construction from the error in weight estimation. Our framework addresses two cases: one where the features are learned functions and one where they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary. In both cases, we establish mild and general conditions under which cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators. In the learned-function case, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to plug-in-type estimators, and is multiply robust when the learned features converge at slow rates. In the variable-selection case, cross-balancing only requires a product condition on how well the selected variables approximate true functions. We illustrate cross-balancing in extensive simulations and an observational study, showing that careful use of outcome information can substantially improve both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability."}

The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.\n  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown.

The paper has two main parts. First, we develop the theory of the metric Rips filtration and its colimit in natural coarse categories: informally, we characterise when the Rips colimit produces a canonical large-scale model of a metric space and use this to prove that the quasigeodesic subcategory is closed under colimits in the coarsely Lipschitz category. We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.\n  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction. Because the approach is based on universal properties and uniformly controlled coarse data rather than inductive constructions, distance formulae, or hierarchy paths, it applies equally well to arbitrary families of metric spaces equipped with pairwise constraints."}

Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations.\n  As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborová--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$.\n  A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction.\n  Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow."}

Our method introduces a Bayesian debiasing procedure that corrects for bias arising from nuisance estimation and employs a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics rather than the full data. These summary statistics are identified in a debiased manner, enabling the estimation of nuisance bias via weighted observables and facilitating hierarchical learning of the ATE. By combining debiasing with sample splitting, our approach separates nuisance estimation from inference on the target parameter, reducing sensitivity to nuisance model specification. We establish that, under mild conditions, the marginal posterior for the ATE satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises theorem when both nuisance models are correctly specified and remains consistent and robust when only one is correct, achieving Bayesian double robustness. This ensures asymptotic efficiency and frequentist validity. Extensive simulations confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating accurate point estimation and credible intervals with nominal coverage, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework can also be extended to other causal estimands, and its key principles offer a general foundation for advancing Bayesian semiparametric inference more broadly."}

Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections.

When the Reynolds number is sent to zero, we show convergence in short time of the solution to that of the Stokes case of 2-D immersed boundary problem, with the optimal error estimates derived. We prove the energy law of the system when $u_0$ additionally belongs to $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. Lastly, we show that the solution is global when the initial data is sufficiently close to an equilibrium state."}

In this article, we estimate the Weibull CV$_p$ and its second-order alternative, denoted as CV$_k$, under type-I progressively interval censoring, which is a typical scenario in survival analysis and reliability theory. Point estimates are obtained using the methods of maximum likelihood, least squares, and the Bayesian approach with MCMC simulation. A nonlinear least squares method is proposed for estimating the CV$_p$ and CV$_k$. We also perform interval estimation of the CV$_p$ and CV$_k$ using the asymptotic confidence intervals, bootstrap intervals through the least squares estimates, and the highest posterior density intervals. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to understand and compare the performance of the estimators.

In this study, we propose intra-block FCTN (iFCTN) decomposition, a novel (un)folding-free variant of FCTN decomposition that streamlines computation. We parameterize each FCTN factor through Khatri-Rao products, which significantly reduces the complexity of reconstructing intermediate sub-networks and yields subproblems with well-structured coefficient matrices.

Typically the states are chosen to be blue and white, and a forcing set is an initial set of blue vertices such that all of the vertices are blue at the end of the process. In this context, the propagation time of a set in a graph is the number of iterations of the color change rule required to have all vertices blue, performing independent color changes simultaneously. Different minimal forcing sets need not have the same propagation time, and we study the realizability of specific integers as propagation times of minimal forcing sets in graphs for two of the most well-studied color change rules (standard and positive semidefinite). Particular attention is paid to the case where all minimal forcing sets have the same propagation time, and we term this phenomenon fixed propagation time. For each of the two variants, we present a general form of graphs all of which have fixed propagation time equal to one. We conjecture that these are the only such graphs and prove the conjectures for joins of graphs. Families of graphs with longer fixed propagation time for standard forcing are exhibited, and it is shown that such graphs do not exist for positive semidefinite forcing."}

We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.\n  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction.

This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work."}

One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.\n  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.\n  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.\n  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool."}

By converting iterated $τ$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals.

Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques."}

For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities."}

The presented approach allows us to handle in the objective pointwise observation and derivatives of the state on an observation set as well as distributed observation terms. In addition, we introduce the concept of locally optimal shapes and we put into evidence its connection to locally minimizers of the corresponding control problem. With directional differentiability results for the control-to-state map at our disposal, we can then state necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes in general non-smooth settings."}

By construction, the LLL algorithm deals with lattices living in a vector space endowed with a positive definite scalar product. However, it seems quite nature to ask about the indefinite case, where the scalar product is replaced by an arbitrary quadratic form, possibily indefinite. This question was considered independently in two lines of work. One by G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} and one by Denis Simon. Both lead to an algorithm that generalizes LLL and whose performance is very similar to LLL, i.e. a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the shortest vector within an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. Denis Simon achieves an approximation factor close to that of LLL under the assumption that no isotropic vectors arise during reduction. G{á}bor Ivanyos and {Á}gnes Sz{á}nt{ó} show that it is possible to avoid isotropic vectors altogether, at the cost of a somewhat worse approximation factor.  In this paper, we revisit the reduction of indefinite lattices and conclude that it can lead to much better reduced representations that previously thought. We also conclude that the approximation factor depends on the signature of the indefinite lattice rather than on its dimension."}

We explore an analogous problem in the unstable situation. For a K-unstable manifold $(X,L)$, its projective embedding via $\\left|kL\\right|$ will be Chow-unstable when $k$ is sufficiently large and divisible. There is a unique filtration on $\\mathrm{H}^{0}(X,kL)$, that corresponds to the maximal destabilizer for Chow-stability of the embedded variety. On the other hand, there is a maximal destabilizer for K-stability after the work of Xia and Li, which corresponds to the steepest descent direction of K-energy. Based on Boucksom-Jonsson's non-Archimedean pluripotential theory and some idealistic assumptions, we provide a route to show that maximal K-destabilizers are quantized by the maximal Chow-destabilizers."}

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes."}

Its properties are thoroughly analyzed in the first part of this work, as for example its disease free steady state, the corresponding effective reproduction numbers, its basic reproduction number (obtained via the Euler and Lotka equation and the next generation matrix approach). We also provide formulas for the time-varying effective reproduction number, and draw relations with the instantaneous growth rate. In the second part, we apply this model to Brazil and use weekly time series data from this country. Various medical parameters are firstly evaluated from these data, and an extensive numerical simulations for the period 2021 to 2024 is then carried out. Estimation of the transmission rates are derived both from epidemiological data and from environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The time-varying effective reproduction numbers are then estimated on these data, following the theoretical investigations performed in the first part. The sensitive parameters that significantly affect the model dynamics are presented graphically. Model predictions for following year by using different transmission rates are finally presented. Our findings show the importance of population age distribution, vector population dynamics, and climate, contributing to a deeper understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Brazil."}

Given a point and a two-plane in the tangent space, we compare the heat mass transported along that plane with its Euclidean counterpart using the relative entropy of finite measures. We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.\n  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data."}
