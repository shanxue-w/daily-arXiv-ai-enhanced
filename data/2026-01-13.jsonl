Our approach exactly conserves the continuous system's key invariants (mass and $L^2$-energy), while also maintaining discrete state-adjoint duality at every time step. These properties are achieved by integrating a centered finite-volume discretization in space with a time-symmetric Crank-Nicolson integrator for both the forward advection and its adjoint, all inside a gradient-based optimization loop. The result is a numerical solver that is faithful to the continuous optimality conditions and efficiently computes mixing-enhancing controls. In our numerical tests, the optimized time-dependent stirring produces a nearly exponential decay of a chosen mix-norm, achieving orders-of-magnitude faster mixing than any single steady flow. To our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that enforcing physical structure at the discrete level can lead to both exact conservation and highly effective mixing outcomes in optimal flow design."}

More specifically, this work targets situations in which the infeasibility of each individual constraint can be detected at lower fidelities, and where a large discrete number of fidelities are available. Moreover, highly discontinuous problems which may fail to evaluate are considered, such that direct search methods are preferred to model-based ones.

However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches.

A natural counterpart to being metrizable for topological spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for approach spaces. The notion of a probabilistic metrizable approach space is based on a well known concrete functor $Γ$, as introduced in [9], from the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous arbitrary t-norm to the category of approach spaces. A characterization of those probabilistic metrizable approach spaces is still missing and in the first part of this paper we solve this problem. A natural counterpart to being metrizable for uniform spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for uniform gauge spaces. In the second part of the paper we start from another concrete functor $Λ$, as described in [7], on the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous t-norm to the category of uniform gauge spaces. In a similar way as for the functor $Γ$ we obtain a characterisation of probabilistic metrizability of uniform gauge spaces. The last section of the paper is devoted to an isomorphic description of the category of probabilistic metric spaces. This problem is not new. Previous attempts in providing isomorphic descriptions of the category of probabilistic metric spaces worked with collections of (pseudo)metrics. These attempts were only formulated in restricted cases. Our isomorphic description is in terms of objects that are sets endowed with a collection of distances, where the distances involved do not satisfy the triangle inequality but fulfil a mixed triangle condition instead."}

Our study highlights that the interplay of the advection term with the stresses given by the multivalued 1-Laplacian is a crucial feature of this model. Eventhough it is an interesting model in itsef, it can also be regarded as a one-dimensional version of the momentum balance of Hibler's model for sea-ice dynamics. Therein, the stress tensor is given by a term with similar properties as the 1-Laplacian in order to account for plastic effects of the ice. For our analysis we start out from a viscoplastic Burgers equation, i.e., a suitably regularized version of the plastic Burgers equation with a small regularization parameter $\\varepsilon>0$. For the viscoplastic Burgers equation, we construct a global BV-solution. In the singular limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$ we deduce the existence of a BV-solution for the plastic Burgers equation.

This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface. Furthermore, these results contribute to existing wide-ranging interest in the relationship between non-orientability, impossibility phenomena in Economics, and logical paradoxes more broadly."}

It was later reformulated to an account based on polynomials; here a further improvement in the style of the other type formers is achieved by employing an interval, in order to give a single pullback specification of a model with \\emph{path types}. The interval is also used to specify a (Hurewicz) fibration structure on the universe of the model. It is shown that the combination of these two conditions suffices to model the intensional identity rules, assuming only finite limits.

These objects arise naturally from a family of non-linear $q$-stochastic operators acting on the space of probability measures. A $q$-equilibrium measure is characterized as a fixed point of such operators, providing a non-linear analogue of the Gibbs equilibrium in the sense of DLR. We establish general conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of $q$-equilibrium measures and demonstrate how quasilocality plays a decisive role in their construction. Moreover, we exhibit examples of $q$-specifications with an empty set of $q$-equilibrium measures. We characterize the set of $q$-equilibrium measures by studying the dynamical systems generated by a class of $q$-stochastic operators. As a concrete application, we show that for the one-dimensional Ising model at sufficiently low temperatures, multiple $q$-equilibrium measures may exist, even though the classical Gibbs measure remains unique. Our results reveal that the $q$-specification formalism extends the DLR theory from linear to non-linear settings and opens a new direction in the study of Gibbs measures and equilibrium states of physical systems."}

Most available models can be formulated as special cases of $m$-th order Markov chains, for $m\\geq 1$. Despite their broad applicability, theoretical research has largely focused on first-order Markov chains, mainly because many properties of higher-order chains can be analyzed by reducing them to first-order chains on an enlarged alphabet. However, the resulting first-order representation is sparse and possesses a highly structured transition kernel, a feature that has not been fully exploited.\n  In this work, we study finite-alphabet Markov chains with arbitrary memory length and introduce a new reduction framework for their structural classification. We define the skeleton of a transition kernel, an object that captures the intrinsic pattern of transition probability constraints in a higher-order Markov chain.\n  We show that the class structure of a binary matrix associated with the skeleton completely determines the recurrent classes and their periods in the original chain. We also provide an explicit algorithm for efficiently extracting the skeleton, which in many cases yields substantial computational savings. Applications include simple criteria for irreducibility and essential irreducibility of higher-order Markov chains and a concrete illustration based on a 10th-order Markov chain."}

A convergence analysis of the resulting Padé-based ETD2RK-DS formulation is provided. We derive explicit and reproducible tensor-slicing and reshaping algorithms that realize the dimension-splitting strategy, decomposing multidimensional systems into collections of independent one-dimensional problems.

The problem involves scheduling all tasks, respecting precedence constraints and resource limitations, while minimizing the combination of the overall makespan and the total energy cost (TEC), which varies according to the TOU pricing, which can take negative values. We propose two novel approaches to solve it: a monolithic Constraint Programming (CP) approach and a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The latter combines a master problem dealing with energy cost solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with a subproblem handling the RCPSP resolved using CP. Both approaches surpass the monolithic compact ILP approach, but the LBBD significantly outperforms the CP when the ratio of energy-intensive tasks over the overall tasks is moderate, allowing for solving instances with up to 1600 tasks in sparse instances.

The APD is defined as the signed sum of the powers of diagonal sums along permutations of the symmetric group, distinguishing between even and odd permutations. It serves as a measure of the broken even-odd symmetry inherent in a matrix through higher-order moments.\n  We applied this invariant to all 880 essentially different normal $4\\times4$ magic squares (excluding symmetries) and defined the \\emph{First Appearance Degree} $m_1$ as the minimum power at which the APD first becomes non-zero. Through an exhaustive computational search, we found that these magic squares are categorized into three clearly separated classes: $m_1=3$ (240 squares), $m_1=4$ (624 squares), and $m_1=\\infty$ (16 squares).\n  In particular, the case $m_1=\\infty$ identifies exceptionally rare magic squares for which the APD vanishes at all degrees. We refer to these as \\emph{Complete Alternating Magic Squares} and demonstrate that they possess a strong algebraic symmetry undetectable by conventional geometric classifications or link-line patterns. Furthermore, we reveal that the APD-based classification refines the classical link-line classification based on complementary sum pairs, showing that each geometric type is clearly distinguished by its first appearance degree.\n  All results in this paper are based on exhaustive computations and are fully reproducible. Our findings suggest that the APD is an effective new invariant for detecting hidden algebraic structures in magic squares and related combinatorial matrices."}

The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes."}

Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $β>0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $γ$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $γ$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-β/(2β+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $γ$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting."}

This work provides a unified mathematical foundation for both formulations. Under mild regularity assumptions on the activation function and for sufficiently wide neural networks of depth at least two, we prove that both the AD- and FD-PINN optimization problems are ill-posed: whenever a minimizer exists, there are in fact infinitely many, and uniqueness fails regardless of the choice of collocation points or finite-difference stencil. Nevertheless, we establish two structural properties. First, whenever the underlying PDE or its finite-difference discretization admits a solution, the corresponding AD-PINN or FD-PINN loss also admits a minimizer, realizable by a neural network of finite width. Second, FD-PINNs are tightly coupled to the underlying finite-difference scheme: every FD-PINN minimizer agrees with a finite-difference minimizer on the grid, and in regimes where the discrete PDE solution is unique, all zero-loss FD-PINN minimizers coincide with the discrete PDE solution on the stencil. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical insights: FD-PINNs remain stable in representative forward and inverse problems, including settings where AD-PINNs may fail to converge. We also include an inverse problem with noisy data, demonstrating that FD-PINNs retain robustness in this setting as well. Taken together, our results clarify the analytical limitations of AD-PINNs and explain the structural reasons for the more stable behavior observed in FD-PINNs."}

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $ρ_0^β\\in H^3$ with $β\\in (\\frac{1}{3},γ-1]$ ($γ$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $β=γ-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $γ\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $ρ_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid.

In the present paper, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves when passing to maximal $m$-step solvable quotients for any integer $m\\geq 2$. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the geometric étale fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over a field of characteristic $0$ is center-free.

The resulting fractals bear a striking visual resemblance to curves appearing in nature, such as coastlines and snowflakes. While these fractals can be generated by a random process that flips a coin each time to decide the orientation of the triangle, leading to 'almost sure' results for their geometrical properties, we define and study them deterministically to provide exact results.

This approach removes the dependence of the online computational cost on the full mesh size. The method is assessed on three benchmark problems: a linear transport equation, a nonlinear Burgers equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The results show that the hyper-reduced models closely match full-order solutions while achieving substantial reductions in computational time. Since only a sparse subset of mesh cells is evaluated during the online phase, the method is naturally parallelizable and scalable to very large meshes. These findings demonstrate that hyper-reduction can be effectively combined with segregated solvers and geometric parametrization to enable fast and accurate CFD simulations."}

This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times."}

The final processing step in compression systems is generally an entropy coding stage, which converts symbols into a bit stream based on their probability distribution. A distinct class of entropy coding methods operates not by mapping input symbols to discrete codewords but by operating on intervals or ranges. This approach enables a more accurate approximation of the source entropy, particularly for sources with highly skewed or varying symbol distributions. Representative techniques in this category include traditional arithmetic coding, range coding, and methods based on asymmetric numeral systems (ANS). The complexity of these methods depends mainly on three processing steps: the core routines of encoding and decoding doing the calculations, the interval-based determination of the correct symbol at decoder, and the efforts of keeping updated with respect to the varying symbol distribution.\n  The interval-based symbol determination at decoder typically demands for a searching procedure. In previous literature, it could be shown that the search can be replaced by a table-based approach with only O(1)-complexity but having the side-effect that the adaptation of the symbols statistic becomes infeasible because of the high time-consumption of adapting the table.\n  We propose an adaptation process using a ring-buffer technique enabling the adaptive table-based decoding procedure as well as the replacement of a division by a bit-shift operation at encoder and decoder core routines. This accelerates the coding process significantly. In static (non-adaptive) mode, the coding time can be reduced by about 40 percent. In adaptive mode, the proposed technique is faster than alternative approaches for alphabets from about 12 to 64 different symbol when comparing the overall encoder+decoder time."}

Starting from any positive integer,\n  if it is a multiple of $10$ then divide it by 10, otherwise, multiply it by $12$, add $8$ times its last digit and divide the result by $10$. Repeat the process infinitely. Regardless the starting number, the process eventually reaches $4$ after a finite number of iterations. The genaral conjecture studied here will encompasse the classical Collatz conjecture togher with our proposed one modulo $10$."}

This model is widely used in engineering to represent highly nonlinear dynamics, such as the Bauschinger effect. The study extends the stochastic elasto-plastic framework of Bensoussan et al. [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 47 (2009), pp. 3374--3396] from the two-dimensional elasto-perfectly-plastic oscillator to the three-dimensional bilinear elasto-plastic oscillator. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, the existence of an invariant measure is established. This extension thus enables the modelling of richer hysteretic behavior and broadens the scope of PDE alternatives to Monte Carlo methods. Two applications demonstrate the method's efficiency: calculating the oscillator's threshold crossing frequency (providing an alternative to Rice's formula) and probability of serviceability."}

A rigorous mathematical analysis is presented, establishing the stability of the scheme and proving the second-order L2-error super-convergence for both displacement and stress.

If the entire data is used at both stages, analytical or computational corrections for selection bias are required to ensure validity (post-learning adjustment). Alternatively, one can learn and/or test on masked versions of the data to avoid selection bias, either via information splitting or null augmentation}. Choosing among these three learn-then-test paradigms, and how much masking to employ for the latter two, are critical decisions impacting power that currently lack theoretical guidance. In a multivariate normal means model, we derive asymptotic power formulas for prototypical methods from each paradigm -- variants of sample splitting, conformal-style null augmentation, and resampling-based post-learning adjustment -- quantifying the power losses incurred by masking at each stage. For these paradigm representatives, we find that post-learning adjustment is most powerful, followed by null augmentation, and then information splitting. Moreover, null augmentation can be nearly as powerful as post-learning adjustment, while avoiding its challenges: the power of the former approaches that of the latter if the number of nulls used for augmentation is a vanishing fraction of the number of hypotheses. We also prove for a tractable proxy that the optimal number of nulls scales as the square root of the number of hypotheses, challenging existing heuristics. Finally, we characterize optimal tuning for information splitting by identifying an optimal split fraction and tying it to the difficulty of the learning problem. These results establish a theoretical foundation for key decisions in the deployment of learn-then-test methods."}

The PMD has demonstrated strong performance for time-dependent systems. However, its formulation is for temporal dynamics and does not directly accommodate parametric variability, which limits its applicability to tasks such as design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification. In order to address the limitations, a \\emph{Parametric Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition} (PPMD) is presented to deal with parametric problems. The central advantage of PPMD is its ability to construct continuous, high-fidelity parametric surrogates while retaining the transparency and non-intrusive workflow of PMD. By integrating probabilistic-manifold embeddings with parameter-aware latent learning, PPMD enables smooth predictions across unseen parameter values (such as different boundary or initial conditions). To validate the proposed method, a comprehensive convergence analysis is established for PPMD, covering the approximation of the linear principal subspace, the geometric recovery of the nonlinear solution manifold, and the statistical consistency of the kernel ridge regression used for latent learning. The framework is then numerically demonstrated on two classic flow configurations: flow past a cylinder and backward-facing step flow. Results confirm that PPMD achieves superior accuracy and generalization beyond the training parameter range compared to the conventional proper orthogonal decomposition with Gaussian process regression (POD+GPR) method."}

We also analyze how the Whittle index depends on the lapse and spontaneous-recovery parameters, providing qualitative insights on intervention priorities. In a large-scale numerical study over heterogeneous two-type populations, we compare Whittle's index policy with a myopic index rule and simple baselines; while myopic is highly competitive on most instances, Whittle's policy yields substantial gains in tight-capacity regimes with a fragile minority, reaching up to about $26\\%$ higher reward and markedly smaller relative optimality gaps."}

Although diffusion-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been exploited for CKM construction, they rely on iterative stochastic sampling, rendering them too slow for real-time wireless applications. To bridge the gap between high fidelity and efficient CKM construction, this letter introduces a novel framework based on linear transport guided flow matching (LT-GFM). Deviating from the noise-removal paradigm of diffusion models, our approach models the CKM generation process as a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) that follows linear optimal transport paths, thereby drastically reducing the number of required inference steps. We propose a unified architecture that is applicable to not only the conventional channel gain map (CGM) construction, but also the more challenging spatial correlation map (SCM) construction. To achieve physics-informed CKM constructions, we integrate environmental semantics (e.g., building masks) for edge recovery and enforce Hermitian symmetry for property of the SCM. Simulation results verify that LT-GFM achieves superior distributional fidelity with significantly lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and accelerates inference speed by a factor of 25 compared to DDPMs."}

Pro-étale motives naturally enhance to a condensed category and we show that their solidification is very close to the category of solid sheaves defined by Fargues-Scholze, suitably modified to work on schemes: this is a rigidity result. As a consequence, we obtain that in contrast with the rigid-analytic setting, solid sheaves on schemes afford the six operations, and we obtain a solid realization functor of motives, extending the $\\ell$-adic realization functor. The solid realization functor is compatible with change of coefficients, which allows one to recover the $\\mathbb{Q}_\\ell$-adic realization functor while remaining in a setting of presentable categories."}

The type number $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, Körner and many others. As the genus of $\\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\\mathrm{WSG}(\\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\\mathcal{O}$.

Unlike existing ADMM variants for nonconvex constrained problems, the proposed method does not require smoothness of the objective functions or differentiability of the constraint mapping, by leveraging convexity of the considered problem. We establish global convergence and an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate of NL-ADMM by assuming the existence of a KKT solution. The results extend those of ADMM for linearly constrained convex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two representative distributed tasks. The results on numerous instances demonstrate that NL-ADMM can achieve (in many cases) 100x higher communication efficiency than the classic augmented Lagrangian method and nearly 2x higher than the Douglas-Rachford operator splitting method, making the new method well suited for large-scale distributed learning systems."}

These models have evolved into large multimodal models (LMMs), which can interpret and analyze multimodal inputs such as images and text. With the exponential growth of AI functionalities in autonomous devices, the central unit (CU), a digital processing unit performing AI inference, needs to handle LMMs to effectively control these devices. To ensure seamless command delivery to devices, the CU must perform the scheduling, which involves resource block (RB) allocation for data transmission and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index selection based on the channel conditions. This task is challenging in many practical environments in 6G, where even small user movement can cause abrupt channel changes. In this paper, we propose a novel LMM-based scheduling technique to address this challenge. Our key idea is to leverage LMM to predict future channel parameters (e.g., distance, angles, and path gain) by analyzing the visual sensing information as well as pilot signals. By exploiting LMMs to predict the presence of reliable path and geometric information of users from the visual sensing information, and then combining these with past channel states from pilot signals, we can accurately predict future channel parameters. Using these predictions, we can preemptively make channel-aware scheduling decisions. From the numerical evaluations, we show that the proposed technique achieves more than 30% throughput gain over the conventional scheduling techniques."}

In this paper, we develop the Censored Graphical Horseshoe (CGHS), a novel Bayesian framework that extends the GHS to censored and arbitrarily missing Gaussian data. By introducing a latent-variable representation, CGHS accommodates incomplete observations while retaining the adaptive global-local shrinkage properties of the Horseshoe prior. We derive efficient Gibbs samplers for posterior computation and establish new theoretical results on posterior behavior under censoring and missingness, filling a gap not addressed by frequentist Lasso-based methods.

The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees."}

We show how the emergent quantum spacetime exhibits minimal length effects, which deliver both classical Minkowski distances and quantum corrections proportional to the Planck length squared.

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $ρ_0^β\\in H^3$ with $β\\in (\\frac{1}{3},γ-1]$ ($γ$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $β=γ-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $γ\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $ρ_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties."}

The {\\em sample complexity} of compressing a given source is defined as the smallest blocklength at which it is possible to compress that source at a specified rate and to within a specified excess-rate probability. This formulation parallels corresponding developments in statistics and computer science, and it facilitates the use of existing results on the sample complexity of various hypothesis testing problems. For arbitrary sources, the sample complexity of general variable-length compressors is shown to be tightly coupled with the sample complexity of prefix-free codes and fixed-length codes. For memoryless sources, it is shown that the sample complexity is characterized not by the source entropy, but by its Rényi entropy of order~$1/2$. Nonasymptotic bounds on the sample complexity are obtained, with explicit constants. Generalizations to Markov sources are established, showing that the sample complexity is determined by the source's Rényi entropy rate of order~$1/2$. Finally, bounds on the sample complexity of universal data compression are developed for arbitrary families of memoryless sources. There, the sample complexity is characterized by the minimum Rényi divergence of order~$1/2$ between elements of the family and the uniform distribution. The connection of this problem with identity testing and with the associated separation rates is explored and discussed."}

We focus on floating-point arithmetic, which allows for using efficient matrix multiplication libraries. However, the existing approach is limited to primes p with bitsize at most half the mantissa size (e.g., 26 bits with double precision arithmetic), and becomes quite inefficient when p approaches this limit. We present a new approach that overcomes this limitation and can efficiently handle primes with larger bitsizes. The key idea is to use multiword decompositions, which represent A and B as scaled sums of u and v matrices (words) with smaller coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis that proves the correctness of this approach for suitably chosen scaling parameters. Our analysis determines the maximum bitsize of p that can be handled for a given number of words; in particular, we show that decomposing in two words each input suffices to handle bitsizes almost equal to the full mantissa size (e.g., the 26 bits limit is raised to 52 bits in double precision arithmetic). Moreover, we show that (1,v) decompositions with v>1 are also of interest to handle intermediate bitsizes. We perform an extensive experimental analysis for various matrix shapes and prime bitsizes. Our performance benchmarks on both CPU and GPU architectures confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach, which can outperform the existing single word approach for bitsizes as low as 23, and can handle bitsizes as high as 52 while retaining high performance."}

A $t$-error function-correcting partition code is an $(\\mathcal{P},t)$-encoding defined directly on a partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $\\mathbb{F}_q^k$. For a partition $\\mathcal{P}=\\{P_1,P_2,\\ldots,P_E\\}$ a systematic mapping $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}} : \\mathbb{F}_q^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_q^{k+r}$ is called a \\emph{$(\\mathcal{P},t)$-encoding} if for all $u\\in P_i$ and $v\\in P_j$ with $i\\neq j$, $d\\big(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}}(u), \\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}}(v)\\big)\\ge 2t+1.$ We show that any $t$-error correcting code for a function $f$, denoted by $(f,t)$-FCC is exactly an FCPC with respect to the domain partition induced by $f$, which makes these codes a natural generalization of FCCs. We use the join of domain partitions to construct a single code that protects multiple functions simultaneously. We define the notion of partition redundancy gain and partition rate gain to measure the bandwidth saved by using a single FCPC for multiple functions instead of constructing separate FCCs for each function. We specialize this to linear functions via coset partition of the intersection of their kernels. Then, we associate a partition graph to any given partition of $\\mathbb{F}_q^k$, and show that the existence of a suitable clique in this graph yields a set of representative information vectors that achieves the optimal redundancy. We showed the existence of a full-size clique in the partition graphs of weight partition and support partition. Finally, we introduce the notion of a block-preserving contraction for a partition, which helps reduce the problem of finding optimal redundancy for an FCPC. We observe that FCPCs naturally provide a form of partial privacy, in the sense that only the domain partition of the function needs to be revealed to the transmitter."}

The approximation space for the displacement is made of vectors values attached to each vertex, edge, face, and element, while the Lagrange multiplier space is approximated by piecewise constant vectors on each fracture face. The displacement degrees of freedom allow reconstruct piecewise quadratic approximations of this field.

By shifting perspective from the tensor A to the isotropic operators that induce A's invariants through contraction, we reveal that the Cayley-Hamilton identity emerges when this vanishing operator acts on the m-fold tensor product of A. The intrinsic tensorial form of the theorem--invariant coefficients multiplying tensor powers--is inherited from the contraction structure rather than imposed ad hoc. We provide explicit verification for two-dimensional space and a dimension-independent proof using Laplace expansion combined with Newton-Girard identities. This framework clarifies why the theorem's structure depends on ambient dimension and suggests extensions to higher-order tensors where classical characteristic polynomial methods fail."}

This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control."}

To maximize the Petz-Rényi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex Hölder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024)."}

Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance safety, reduce emissions, and increase throughput through precise coordination and automation. However, existing CAV strategies remain confined to specialized scenarios, such as highway on-ramp merging or single-lane roundabouts, and traditional traffic signals sacrifice efficiency for safety via rigid phasing and all-red intervals. In this paper, we present Cyclic Modulation Control of Multi-Conflict Connected Automated Traffic (CMAT), a unified, geometry-agnostic framework that embeds each conflict point into a repeating sequence of \"micro-phases\". Vehicles dynamically form platoons with demand-responsive sizes and negotiate time slots for occupying conflict points, enabling collision-free traversal and high intersection utilization. CMAT aims to minimize delay, guarantee safety, and accommodate arbitrary merging, diverging, and crossing patterns without manual retuning. We formalize CMAT as a mixed-integer linear programming model constructed on a directed graph abstracted from the physical intersection layout. The performance of CMAT is evaluated across a suite of multi-conflict tests, including simple two-way crossings, four-leg intersections, complex connected intersections. The results demonstrate substantial reductions in delay and significant throughput improvements compared with state-of-the-art CAV coordination methods and traditional signal timing strategies."}

In this paper we study the number of subsequences of a non-binary string in this scenario, and propose some improved bounds on the number of subsequences of $r$-run non-binary strings.

However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.\n  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model."}

In this paper, we first investigate how to design SK-type scheme for the 2-path quasi-static fading channel with noiseless feedback.

On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology."}

Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range."}

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $ρ_0^β\\in H^3$ with $β\\in (\\frac{1}{3},γ-1]$ ($γ$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $β=γ-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $γ\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $ρ_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties."}

In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker."}

First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes.\n  We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas.

In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to describe the entire feasible set of such joint distributions with uniform margins. We show that this admissible set forms a convex polytope, analyze its symmetry properties, and characterize its extreme rays. These extremal distributions provide fundamental insights into how higher-order dependence structures may vary while preserving the prescribed pairwise information. Unlike traditional methods for table generation, which return a single table, our framework makes it possible to explore and understand the full admissible space of dependence structures, enabling more flexible choices for modeling and simulation. We illustrate the usefulness of our theoretical results through examples and a real case study on rater agreement."}

It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds.

However, the CSI feedback overhead becomes a major bottleneck as the number of antennas increases. Although existing deep learning-based CSI compression methods have shown great potential, they still face limitations in capturing both local and global features of CSI, thereby limiting achievable compression efficiency. To address these issues, we propose TCLNet, a unified CSI compression framework that integrates a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture for lossy compression with a hybrid language model (LM) and factorized model (FM) design for lossless compression. The lossy module jointly exploits local features and global context, while the lossless module adaptively switches between context-aware coding and parallel coding to optimize the rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) trade-off. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed TCLNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and transmission efficiency, achieving up to a 5 dB performance gain across diverse scenarios.

In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes.

This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \\emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation. Earlier experiments employing an Eyre-type semi-implicit solver were not compatible with this residual mechanism due to the cost and instability of Newton iterations within batched GPU training.\n  On a dataset of 50k training and 10k testing pairs on $128\\times128$ grids (with natural $[-1,1]$ amplitude scaling), the best trained model attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately \\textbf{0.23988159} on the full test set, with a sample-wise standard deviation of about \\textbf{0.00266345}.

Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix $W(G)$, which lead to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph.

The {\\em sample complexity} of compressing a given source is defined as the smallest blocklength at which it is possible to compress that source at a specified rate and to within a specified excess-rate probability. This formulation parallels corresponding developments in statistics and computer science, and it facilitates the use of existing results on the sample complexity of various hypothesis testing problems. For arbitrary sources, the sample complexity of general variable-length compressors is shown to be tightly coupled with the sample complexity of prefix-free codes and fixed-length codes. For memoryless sources, it is shown that the sample complexity is characterized not by the source entropy, but by its Rényi entropy of order~$1/2$. Nonasymptotic bounds on the sample complexity are obtained, with explicit constants. Generalizations to Markov sources are established, showing that the sample complexity is determined by the source's Rényi entropy rate of order~$1/2$. Finally, bounds on the sample complexity of universal data compression are developed for arbitrary families of memoryless sources. There, the sample complexity is characterized by the minimum Rényi divergence of order~$1/2$ between elements of the family and the uniform distribution. The connection of this problem with identity testing and with the associated separation rates is explored and discussed."}

In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."}

In this paper, we study a multi-server secure aggregation problem in a two-hop network consisting of multiple aggregation servers and multiple users per server, under the presence of user collusion. Each user communicates only with its associated server, while the servers exchange messages to jointly recover the global sum. We adopt an information-theoretic security framework, allowing up to $T$ users to collude with any server.\n  We characterize the complete optimal rate region in terms of user-to-server communication rate, server-to-server communication rate, individual key rate, and source key rate. Our main result shows that the minimum communication and individual key rates are all one symbol per input symbol, while the optimal source key rate is given by $\\min\\{U+V+T-2,\\, UV-1\\}$, where $U$ denotes the number of servers and $V$ the number of users per server. The achievability is established via a linear key construction that ensures correctness and security against colluding users, while the converse proof relies on tight entropy bounds derived from correctness and security constraints.\n  The results reveal a fundamental tradeoff between security and key efficiency and demonstrate that the multi-server architecture can significantly reduce the required key randomness compared to single-server secure aggregation. Our findings provide a complete information-theoretic characterization of secure aggregation in multi-server systems with user collusion."}

To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy."}

By leveraging cached content to suppress interference, VCC enables the concurrent transmission of multiple precoded signal vectors that would otherwise require separate transmission resources. This leads to a multiplicative improvement in resource utilization in SATCOM. To characterize this performance, we model the satellite-to-ground channel using Rician-shadowed fading and after incorporating practical considerations such as matched-filter precoding, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead as well as CSI imperfections at the transmitter, we here derive closed-form expressions for the average sum rate and spectral efficiency gain of VCC in SATCOM. Our analysis, tightly validated through numerical simulations, reveals that VCC can yield spectral efficiency gains of 300% to 550% over traditional multi-user MISO SATCOM with the same resources. These gains -- which have nothing to do with multicasting, prefetching gains nor file popularity -- highlight VCC as a pure physical-layer solution for future high-throughput SATCOM systems, significantly narrowing the performance gap between satellite and wired networks."}

Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\\'ı}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.\n  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities."}

This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability."}

By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation.

However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks."}

Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM."}

We consider a dual-waveguide architecture that simultaneously delivers covert information and randomized jamming to hide the transmission footprint, incorporating three representative PASS power-radiation laws-general, proportional, and equal. To characterize the system-level detectability, we derive closed-form expressions for local false-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. By leveraging a probability-generating-function (PGF) and elementary-symmetric-polynomial (ESP) framework, combined with a breakpoint-based partition of the threshold domain, we obtain explicit closed-form characterizations of the system-level detection error probability (DEP) under non-i.i.d. majority-voting fusion. Building on this analytical framework, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the average covert rate subject to covertness constraint. To solve the resulting nonconvex design, we develop an MM-BCD-SCA algorithm that produces tractable alternating updates for power/radiation variables and PA positions via convex surrogates and inner approximations of the DEP value function. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of cooperative monitoring and PASS radiation laws on the covertness-rate tradeoff."}

For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary.

Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing."}

This process replaces the bifurcation parameter of the deterministic Allee effect equation. In the model, small noise may induce escape from the safe basin around the positive equilibrium toward extinction. We construct a stochastic control, altering the process to have a stationary distribution. We enable tractable control design, approximating the process by one with a stationary distribution. Two controlled models are developed, one acting directly on population size and another also modulating the environment.

Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing."}

In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schrödinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schrödinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches."}

To maximize the Petz-Rényi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex Hölder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024)."}

In this work, we introduce Doob's matching, a novel framework for guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-penalized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance.

However, such a link renders the effective channel highly rank deficient and fundamentally limits spatial multiplexing. To overcome this limitation, this paper leverages the large aperture of sparse arrays to harness near field spherical wavefronts, and establishes a deterministic deployment criterion that strategically positions the IRS in the near field of a base station BS. This placement exploits the spherical wavefronts of the BS IRS link to engineer decorrelated channels, thereby fundamentally overcoming the rank deficiency issue in far field cascaded channels. Based on a physical channel model for the sparse BS array and the IRS, we characterize the rank properties and inter user correlation of the cascaded BS IRS user channel. We further derive a closed form favorable propagation metric that reveals how the sparse array geometry and the IRS position can be tuned to reduce inter user channel correlation. The resulting geometry driven deployment rule provides a simple guideline for creating a favorable propagation environment with enhanced effective degrees of freedom. The favorable channel statistics induced by our deployment criterion enable a low complexity maximum ratio transmission MRT precoding scheme. This serves as the foundation for an efficient algorithm that jointly optimizes the IRS phase shifts and power allocation based solely on long term statistical channel state information CSI. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our deployment criterion and demonstrate that our optimization framework achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes."}

In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern).

Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity. We formulate the Haag-Kastler axioms in this setup, establish the coherence needed for the construction, and work out representative examples."}

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems."}

Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing."}

To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark.

Then, the sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is formulated for each of the proposed protocols. 1) For PS, the highly coupled non-convex problem is first transformed into a tractable form via the weighted minimum mean square error reformulation and solved using the alternating optimization framework; 2) For DS, the above approach is subsequently extended to solve the mixed-integer constraints inherent for DS via the penalty-based algorithm; 3) For TS, the optimization problem can be decomposed into two subproblems and solved using the similar iterative techniques, while its optimal time allocation ratio is derived in closed form. Finally, numerical results reveal that TS is superior in the low-power regime, while PS and DS achieve significantly higher rates in the high-power regime due to the enhanced DoF."}

For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.\n  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich.

Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority."}

The notion of happy vertices was introduced by Zhang and Li to compute the homophily of a graph. Eto, et al. introduced the Maker-Maker version of the Happy vertex game, where two players compete to claim more happy vertices than their opponent. We introduce here the Maker-Breaker happy vertex game: two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately color the vertices of a graph with their respective colors. Maker aims to maximize the number of happy vertices at the end, while Breaker aims to prevent her. This game is also a scoring version of the Maker-Breaker Domination game introduced by Duchene, et al. as a happy vertex corresponds exactly to a vertex that is not dominated in the domination game. Therefore, this game is a very natural game on graphs and can be studied within the scope of scoring positional games. We initiate here the complexity study of this game, by proving that computing its score is PSPACE-complete on trees, NP-hard on caterpillars, and polynomial on subdivided stars. Finally, we provide the exact value of the score on graphs of maximum degree 2, and we provide an FPT-algorithm to compute the score on graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. An important contribution of the paper is that, to achieve our hardness results, we introduce a new type of incidence graph called the literal-clause incidence graph for 2-SAT formulas. We prove that QMAX 2-SAT remains PSPACE-complete even if this graph is acyclic, and that MAX 2-SAT remains NP-complete, even if this graph is acyclic and has maximum degree 2, i.e. is a union of paths. We demonstrate the importance of this contribution by proving that Incidence, the scoring positional game played on a graph is also PSPACE-complete when restricted to forests."}

In the high-privacy regime, we use concepts from information geometry to obtain a local quadratic approximation of mutual information which measures utility between $U$ and $Y$. When the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, this approximation reduces the design problem to a sparse quadratic maximization, known as the Rayleigh-quotient problem, with an $\\ell_0$ constraint. We further show that, for the approximated problem, one can without loss of optimality restrict attention to a binary released variable $U$ with a uniform distribution.

For general dimensions, the resulting sparse Rayleigh-quotient maximization is NP-hard and closely related to sparse principal component analysis (PCA).

A fundamental question in this field is to determine the minimum number of erroneous copies required to guarantee correct reconstruction of the original sequence. This problem is equivalent to determining the maximum possible intersection size of two error balls associated with the underlying channel. Existing research on the sequence reconstruction problem has largely focused on channels with a single type of error, such as insertions, deletions, or substitutions alone. However, relatively little is known for channels that involve a mixture of error types, for instance, channels allowing both deletions and substitutions. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for the single-deletion two-substitution channel, which allows one deletion and at most two substitutions applied to the transmitted sequence. Specifically, we prove that if two $q$-ary length-$n$ sequences have the Hamming distance $d\\geq 2$, where $q\\geq 2$ is any fixed integer, then the intersection size of their error balls under the single-deletion two-substitution channel is upper bounded by $(q^2-1)n^2-(3q^2+5q-5)n+O_q(1)$, where $O_q(1)$ is a constant independent from $n$ but dependent on $q$.

This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy."}

Recently, researchers have constructed XSTPIR schemes through the theory of algebraic geometry codes and algebraic curves, with the aim of obtaining XSTPIR schemes that have higher maximum PIR rates for fixed field size and $X,T$ (the number of servers $N$ is not restricted). The mainstream approach is to employ curves of higher genus that have more rational points, evolving from rational curves to elliptic curves to hyperelliptic curves and, most recently, to Hermitian curves.\n  In this paper, we propose a different perspective: with the shared goal of constructing XSTPIR schemes with higher maximum PIR rates, we move beyond the mainstream approach of seeking curves with higher genus and more rational points. Instead, we aim to achieve this goal by enhancing the utilization efficiency of rational points on curves that have already been considered in previous work. By introducing a family of bases for the polynomial space $\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}\\{1,x,\\dots,x^{k-1}\\}$ as an alternative to the Lagrange interpolation basis, we develop two new families of XSTPIR schemes based on rational curves and Hermitian curves, respectively. Parameter comparisons demonstrate that our schemes achieve superior performance. Specifically, our Hermitian-curve-based XSTPIR scheme provides the largest known maximum PIR rates when the field size $q^2\\geq 14^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4q$. Moreover, for any field size $q^2\\geq 28^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4$, our two XSTPIR schemes collectively provide the largest known maximum PIR rates."}

We introduce and characterize optimal Lee-metric anticodes over the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^s\\mathbb{Z}$. We show that the family of such anticodes admits a natural partition into subtypes and forms a lattice under inclusion. We establish a bijection between this lattice and a lattice of weak compositions ordered by dominance.

Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.\n  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.\n  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory."}

Although quantizing twice may seem redundant, the ADC quantization in orthogonal frequency-division duplex (OFDM) systems appears in the time domain, and one must then convert to the frequency domain, where quantization can be applied only to the signals at active subcarriers. This reduces fronthaul load and avoids unnecessary distortion, since the ADC output spans all OFDM samples while only a subset of subcarriers carries useful information.\n  While both quantization effects have been extensively studied in narrowband systems, their joint impact in practical wideband OFDM-based cell-free massive MIMO remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by modeling the joint distortion and proposing a fronthaul strategy in which each AP processes the received signal to reduce quantization artifacts before transmission. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm that reconstructs the unquantized time-domain signal prior to fronthaul transmission and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed design offers new insights for implementing efficient, quantization-aware uplink transmission in wideband cell-free architectures."}

Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures."}

It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincaré CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits."}

This was previously unknown even for the case of no errors.\n  We give a similar algorithm for additive characters of polynomials over fields of characteristic $2$. This gives the first polynomial time algorithm for decoding dual-BCH codes of polynomial dimension from a constant fraction of errors.\n  Our algorithms use ideas from Stepanov's polynomial method proof of the classical Weil bounds on character sums, as well as from the Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes.

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(Σ_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $Σ_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $Σ_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs."}

Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training"}
