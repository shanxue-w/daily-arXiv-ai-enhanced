The forward problem is discretized with summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, and interface/boundary and initial/terminal conditions are imposed weakly via simultaneous approximation terms (SAT), yielding a stable monolithic space-time scheme on heterogeneous domains. Stability is proven under specific conditions on the SAT parameters, scaled with the spatial mesh resolution and material properties. We compute design sensitivities using a discrete space-time adjoint scheme that is dual-consistent with the primal SBP-SAT scheme. Dual consistency ensures that the discrete adjoint consistently approximates the continuous dual problem and, under standard smoothness assumptions, yields superconvergent functional estimates. We validate the resulting optimal designs by comparison with an independently computed reference optimal design and report time-to-solution and cost-of-accuracy curves, comparing against low-order time-marching and all-at-once solvers for the forward and adjoint systems. The proposed scheme attains high accuracy with fewer space-time degrees of freedom and remains stable, reducing time-to-solution and memory compared with an alternative all-at-once solver. This makes it a future candidate for large-scale topology optimization of time-dependent thermal systems."}

Spin-orbit coupling gives rise to fascinating phenomena, including supersolid-like phases with spatially modulated densities. However, in such complex settings, conventional numerical approaches, such as generalized inverse iterations or gradient descent, often converge very slowly. To overcome this issue, we apply the concept of the J-method [E.~Jarlebring, S.~Kvaal, W.~Michiels. SIAM~J.~Sci.~Comput.~36-4,~2014] to construct a nonlinear inverse iteration scheme whose convergence can be accelerated through spectral shifting, analogous to techniques used for linear eigenproblems. For a fixed shift parameter, we establish local linear convergence rates determined by spectral gaps in the neighbourhood of each quasi-unique ground state. With adaptively chosen shifts, superlinear convergence is observed, which we verify through numerical experiments."}

It was originally introduced for the homogeneous one-dimensional wave equation in [Ciaramella, Gander, Mazzieri, 2024]. UTP is inspired by the Mapped Tent Pitching (MTP) algorithm [Gopalakrishnan, Sch{ö}berl, Wintersteiger, 2017], which constructs the solution by iteratively building polytopal space--time subdomains, referred to as tents. In MTP, each physical tent is mapped onto a space--time rectangle, where local problems are solved before being mapped back to the original domain. In contrast, UTP avoids the nonlinear and potentially singular mapping step by computing the solution directly on a physical space--time rectangle that contains the tent, at the expense of redundant computations in the region outside the tent. In this work, we investigate several strategies to extend UTP to heterogeneous media, where the wave propagation speed is piecewise constant over two subregions of the domain. Among the considered approaches, the most efficient in terms of computational time is the one employing space--time subdomains with identical spatial and temporal dimensions in both regions, determined by the maximum propagation speed."}

As the main theoretical result we show that the fully-discrete method satisfies a discrete analog of the free energy dissipation inequality. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and show the applicability of the method for realistic settings including an extension to chemically reacting flow.

Moreover, the class of positive operators here may be replaced with several other important classes of operators (e.g., lattice homomorphisms). We also discuss conditions when the uniform adherence of a sublattice equals its uniform closure, and present an example (based on a construction by R.N. Ball and A.W. Hager) where this fails."}

It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as Hölder smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting."}

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

They admit closed-form expressions for densities and many functionals of interest, making them attractive for practical applications. However, the complex conditions on the dependence parameters to ensure that Sarmanov copulas are valid limit their application in high dimensions. Verifying the $d$-increasing property typically requires satisfying a combinatorial set of inequalities that makes direct construction difficult. To circumvent this issue, we develop a stochastic representation for bivariate Sarmanov copulas. We prove that every admissible Sarmanov can be realized as a mixture of independent univariate distributions indexed by a latent Bernoulli pair. The stochastic representation replaces the problem of verifying copula validity with the problem of ensuring nonnegativity of a Bernoulli probability mass function. The representation also recovers classical copula families, including Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern, Huang--Kotz, and Bairamov--Kotz--Bekçi as special cases. We further derive sharp global bounds for Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. We then introduce a Bernoulli-mixing construction in higher dimensions, leading to a new class of multivariate Sarmanov copulas with easily verifiable parameter constraints and scalable simulation algorithms.

We empirically demonstrate that tokenizer training scale redistributes entropy: as training data grows, the token stream becomes more diverse in aggregate (higher unigram entropy) yet markedly more predictable in-context (lower higher-order conditional entropies), indicating that tokenization absorbs substantial short-range regularity although these gains degrade under train-test domain mismatch. To ground these observations, we first benchmark i) pretrained GPT-family tokenizers as black-box compressors across various domains, and ii) learned tokenizers across configurations spanning vocabulary size, training scale, and domain. Next, we study tokenization as a transform for universal compression and introduce a compression-aware BPE variant.

While classical theories often assume an instantaneous alignment between strain and vorticity, the present analysis identifies a systematic Lagrangian phase lag governing the onset of intense dissipation. By conditionally averaging the dynamics of fluid parcels, a distinct phase-space hysteresis is revealed. Trajectories are captured by the saddle-point topology of the pressure field ($λ_{min}^p < 0$) prior to experiencing peak enstrophy amplification. This temporal ordering ($τ> 0$) demonstrates that the pressure topology acts as a deterministic geometric precursor, organizing the flow structure before the bursting event occurs.

As it is the case in many branches of complexity theory, the unconditional separation of these complexity classes seems elusive. In stark contrast, the symmetric analogue of Valiant's conjecture has been proven by Dawar and Wilsenach (2020): the permanent does not admit symmetric algebraic circuits of polynomial size, while the determinant does. Symmetric algebraic circuits are both a powerful computational model and amenable to proving unconditional lower bounds.\n  In this paper, we develop a symmetric algebraic complexity theory by introducing symmetric analogues of the complexity classes VP, VBP, and VF called symVP, symVBP, and symVF. They comprise polynomials that admit symmetric algebraic circuits, skew circuits, and formulas, respectively, of polynomial orbit size. Having defined these classes, we show unconditionally that $\\mathsf{symVF} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{symVBP} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{symVP}$. To that end, we characterise the polynomials in symVF and symVBP as those that can be written as linear combinations of homomorphism polynomials for patterns of bounded treedepth and pathwidth, respectively. This extends a previous characterisation by Dawar, Pago, and Seppelt (2026) of symVP.\n  Finally, we show that symVBP and symVP contain homomorphism polynomials which are VBP- and VP-complete, respectively. We give general graph-theoretic criteria for homomorphism polynomials and their linear combinations to be VBP-, VP-, or VNP-complete. These conditional lower bounds drastically enlarge the realm of natural polynomials known to be complete for VNP, VP, or VBP. Under the assumption VFPT $\\neq$ VW[1], we precisely identify the homomorphism polynomials that lie in VP as those whose patterns have bounded treewidth."}

This scheme is built on 3GPP-supported sensing modes, and it does not incur any extra spectrum cost or inter-cell coordination. To reveal the fundamental performance limit of the proposed hybrid sensing mode, we derive closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing target localization and velocity estimation, as functions of target and UE positions. The results reveal that significant performance gains can be achieved over the purely mono- or bi-static sensing, especially when the BS-target-UE form a favorable geometry, which is close to a right triangle. The analytical results are validated by simulations using effective parameter estimation algorithm and weighted mean square error (MSE) fusion method. Based on the derived sensing bound, we further analyze the sensing coverage by varying the UE positions, which shows that sensing coverage first improves then degrades as the BS-UE separation increases. Furthermore, the sensing accuracy for a potential target with best UE selection is derived as a function of the UE density in the network."}

In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing.

The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.\n  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges.

However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS."}

However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting."}

The core of our approach is the design of a canonical internal model that directly converts the disturbance rejection problem into an adaptive stabilization problem for an augmented system. Unlike conventional methods, this internal model is synthesized directly from the given nonlinear plant and the knowledge of the exosystem, without relying on the solution of the regulator equations. This makes the approach applicable to a significantly broader class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive disturbance observer comprising the canonical nonlinear internal model, a Luenberger-type state observer, and a parameter adaptation law. This observer ensures global asymptotic convergence of the disturbance estimate to the true disturbance without requiring persistent excitation (PE). Under the PE condition, both the disturbance estimation error and the parameter estimation error converge exponentially. By incorporating the disturbance estimate as a feedforward compensation signal, we establish sufficient conditions for achieving global trajectory tracking and asymptotic disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical simulation of a flexible-joint robotic manipulator."}

Compute payload - the unsustainable energy and capital costs of training and inference - threatens to outpace grid capacity and concentrate capability among a handful of organizations. Data chaos - the 80% of project effort consumed by preparation, conversion, and preprocessing - strangles development velocity and locks datasets to single model architectures. Current approaches treat these as separate problems, managing each with incremental optimization while increasing ecosystem complexity. This paper presents ServaStack: a universal data format (.serva) paired with a universal AI compute engine (Chimera). The .serva format achieves lossless compression by encoding information using laser holography principles, while Chimera converts compute operations into a representational space where computation occurs directly on .serva files without decompression. The result is automatic data preprocessing. The Chimera engine enables any existing model to operate on .serva data without retraining, preserving infrastructure investments while revamping efficiency. Internal benchmarks demonstrate 30-374x energy efficiency improvements (96-99% reduction), 4x-34x lossless storage compression, and 68x compute payload reduction without accuracy loss when compared to RNN, CNN, and MLP models on FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets. At hyperscale with one billion daily iterations, these gains translate to $4.85M savings per petabyte per training cycle. When any data flows to any model on any hardware, the AI development paradigm shifts. The bottleneck moves from infrastructure to imagination."}

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-cell cooperative air-computation framework assisted by dual-polarized movable antennas (D-PMA), and formulates a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the combining matrix, polarization vectors, antenna positions, and user transmit coefficients. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex, so an alternating algorithm is developed in which closed-form updates are obtained for the combining matrix and transmit coefficients. Then a method based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed to refine polarization vectors, and the antenna positions are updated using a gradient-based method.

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning."}

For this test, the exponential decay of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability is studied. First, it is shown that the divergence test achieves the optimal first-order exponent, irrespective of the choice of divergence. Second, it is demonstrated that the divergence test with an invariant divergence achieves the same second-order asymptotics as the Gutman test.

As usual, one side is burnt, and as the level of batter decreases, the pancakes became smaller and smaller. Hence, the waiter ends up with a stack of one-sided burnt pancakes sorted by size, with the larger at the bottom and burnt side up. However, the waiter cannot serve them this way. He needs to turn all the burnt sides down, without changing the order. Having only a spatula, he can only perform flips to the top of the stack. How can he perform this transformation in a minimum number of flips? Having n pancakes, this problem can be modeled in the burnt pancake graph, having 2^n*n! vertices, where each possible stack of pancakes corresponds to a vertex expressed by a permutation of size n, where the pancakes are ordered by size, and the pancake numbers are multiplied by -1, if the corresponding pancake has the burnt side side up. An edge exists in this graph, if the corresponding stacks can be reached from each other by one flip. Let T(n) be the minimum number of flips to sort the stack of n pancakes (-1,...,-n). General burnt pancake sorting has been introduced by Bill Gates and Papadimitriou. The instance (-1,...,-n) has strong relevance because of its easy structure and as it has been shown to be a worst-case instance for several small n. Heydari and Sudborough gave the currently best upper bound of T(n), namely (3n+3)/2 for n = 3 mod 4, which later has been shown to be exact by a work of Cibulka. Except these two works, no progress regarding lower and upper bounds has been made until now. In our work, we present that (3n+3)/2 is also an upper bound of T(n) for n = 1 mod 4, which again matches the lower bound of Cibulka and thus is exact. The case of even n keeps an open problem, where two possible values for T(n) are possible, namely (3/2)n + 1 or (3/2)n + 2."}

First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem.

Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions.

This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size."}

These divergences naturally govern acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains. In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing. As a consequence, our results provide quantitative control of relative density mismatch, clarify the role of discretization bias in strong divergences, and yield principled guarantees relevant both for unadjusted sampling and for generating warm starts for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains."}

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality."}

The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively.

Playing this game in real life can be done by placing tokens on the vertices of the board. In this paper, we study the unfortunate case in which one or both players do not have enough tokens to cover all the vertices and, as such, will have to move their tokens around at some point instead of placing new ones. There may be a bias, in that Maker and Breaker do not necessarily have the same amount of tokens. The present paper initiates the study of this generalization of positional games, called token positional games. A particularly interesting case is when Maker has a winning strategy in the classical game: what is the lowest number of tokens with which she still wins against Breaker's unlimited stock? We notably show that, for $k$-uniform hypergraphs on an arbitrarily large number $n$ of vertices, this number equals $k$ if $k \\in\\{2,3\\}$ but can vary from $k$ to $Ω(n)$ if $k \\geq 4$.

We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \\times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism."}

The derivation relies on properties of likelihood ratio quantiles and is general enough to extend to the case of $σ$-finite measures in all non-trivial cases. The convex conjugate of the Type II error volume, called the primitive entropy spectrum, is expressed as an integral of the complementary distribution function of the likelihood ratio using a standard spectral identity. The resulting dual characterization of the Type II error volume leads to state of the art bounds for the case of product measures via Berry--Esseen theorem through a brief analysis relying on properties of the Gaussian Mills ratio, both with and without tilting."}

In the symmetric case, we reprove Hodges' universality theorem (arXiv:2311.07078), i.e. the version incorporating the canonical pairing from Wood's setting, and in the alternating case we reprove the local universality theorem of Nguyen-Wood (arXiv:2210.08526). A key advantage of our method is that it is quantitative: we obtain explicit error bounds, which are exponentially small in most regimes, thereby addressing Wood's question on effective convergence rates. Our argument is inspired by Maples' exposure-process and coupling viewpoint (arXiv:1301.1239) and uses a generalized form of Fourier-analytic estimates in the exponentially sharp style of Ferber-Jain-Sah-Sawhney (arXiv:2106.04049)."}

Our work is a significant generalization of a recent result of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025) that showed that the RPA decoder provably achieves vanishing error probabilities for \"low-rate\" RM codes, over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). While a straightforward generalization of the proof strategy in that paper will require additional, restrictive assumptions on the BMS channel, our technique, which employs an equivalence between the RPA projection operation and a part of the \"channel combining\" phase in polar codes, requires no such assumptions. Interestingly, such an equivalence allows for the use of a generic union bound on the error probability of the first-order RM code (the \"base case\" of the RPA decoder), under maximum-likelihood decoding, which holds for any BMS channel. We then exploit these observations in the proof strategy outlined in the work of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025), and argue that, much like in the case of the BSC, one can obtain vanishing error probabilities, in the large $n$ limit (where $n$ is the blocklength), for RM orders that scale roughly as $\\log \\log n$, for all BMS channels."}

For this model, we prove the existence of a secret sharing strategy that achieves the same secret rate at each time step as the best known strategy for the fixed access structure version of this model.

Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explicit lower bounds on the number of partition matrices satisfying a given family of structure-avoidance constraints, and further obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent solutions under row/column permutations. Moreover, via Rényi-entropy bounds for the MT distribution, we provide a computable lower bound on the number of distinct solutions that the MT algorithm can output, giving a concrete diversity guarantee for randomized constructions. Specializations for eliminating 4-cycle candidates yield closed-form bounds as functions of system parameters, offering a principled way to size memory/lifting and to estimate the remaining search space."}

Formal disproof of the published \"certainty-scope\" trade-off conjecture for symbolic and generative AI", "summary": "We formally disprove a recently conjectured artificial intelligence trade-off between epistemic certainty and scope in the universal hyperbolic product form in which it was published. Certainty is defined as the worst-case correctness probability over the input space, and scope as the sum of the Kolmogorov complexities of the input and output sets. Using standard facts from coding theory and algorithmic information theory, we show, first, that when the conjecture is instantiated with prefix (self-delimiting, prefix-free) Kolmogorov complexity, it leads to an internal inconsistency, and second, that when it is instantiated with plain Kolmogorov complexity, it is refuted by a constructive counterexample. These results establish a general theorem: contrary to the conjecture's claim, no universal \"certainty-scope\" hyperbola holds as a general bound under the published definitions."}

Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices."}
