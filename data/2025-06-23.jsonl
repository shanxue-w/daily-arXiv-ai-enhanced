However, the intricate relationships between\nthe signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to\ninaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies\nbetween the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in\npractical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative\nto the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the\nnear-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the\nhigh-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the\nestimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and\nrotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely\nhigh computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient\nhybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave\npropagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation\namong different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity,\nwe propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently\nconstructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation\npairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform.

While\nbuffer-aided relay networks have demonstrated significantly improved\nperformance, energy harvesting has become an attractive solution in many\nwireless systems, garnering considerable attention when applied to buffer-aided\nrelay networks. It is known that state-dependent selection rules must be used\nto achieve full diversity order in buffer-aided relay networks, requiring link\npriorities for data transmission to be set based on system states. This task\nbecomes challenging when both data buffers and energy storage are involved. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel method for setting link priorities, which\nforms the basis for a new selection rule. The outage probability of the\nproposed selection scheme is derived.

Like the previous simple-domain contribution (Journal of\nComputational Physics X 15, (2022)), the present approach relies on the use of\nthe Fourier Continuation method for accurate spectral representation of\nnon-periodic functions in conjunction with smooth artificial viscosity\nassignments localized in regions detected by means of a Shock-Detecting Neural\nNetwork (SDNN).

Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on\nonline data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online\nphase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings,\nrich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to\ndeploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained\nmachine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and\nhistorical data into \\emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this\nsetting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true\nreward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML\npredictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose\nthe Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which\ncan be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.\nWhen the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves\nthe cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in\ncases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean\nrewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance\nmatrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard\nUCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even\nwhen the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and\ntrue rewards are moderate."}

Unlike traditional feedforward\napproaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby\ninheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately,\nexisting theoretical guarantees for OFO assumes that the controller operates on\na slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and\ntransient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale\nseparation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone\nsystems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point,\nregardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small\ngain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for\nglobal convergence.

Such an integrability lives on the space of\nnon-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in\ngeneralized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation.

The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson\nlines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global\nsymmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills\nequations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite\ndimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop\nspace of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time.

Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis\nacross domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum\nphysics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization.

At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal\nstate), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)\nor state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition\nbetween states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over\ntime. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of\nprocesses.

To\nthis end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large\nbody of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and\npropagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively,\nthe experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any\nattempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to\naccount for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and\niii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all\nthese three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by\nKumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys.

We propose a new soft survival tree\nmodel (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a\nnonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs\nprovide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a\nsingle leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit\nthe related benefits.

Linear systems\nresulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large\ndimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of\niterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction\nlines, Calder\\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric\nfield integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation.

For systematic\ncodes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of\nminimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine\nthe exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework\nprovides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design\ntheory."}

Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which\ndecays exponentially with rotation angles $(\\theta, \\phi)$, influencing error\ncorrection performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates\nunder circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and\nsuperconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our\nfindings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and\n$0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper\ndecay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$,\nlogical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise,\nwhich exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated\nlogical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved\nresilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based\nencoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes,\noffering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction."}

Domain decomposition\nmethods (DDM) constitute one of the most promising strategy so far, by\ncombining direct and iterative approaches: using direct solvers on overlapping\nor non-overlapping subdomains, as a preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method\non the original Helmholtz system or as an iterative solver on a substructured\nproblem involving field values or Lagrange multipliers on the interfaces\nbetween the subdomains. In this work we compare the computational performance\nof non-overlapping substructured DDM and Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz\n(ORAS) preconditioners for solving large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple\nsources, as is encountered, e.g., in frequency-domain Full Waveform Inversion.\nWe show on a realistic geophysical test-case that, when appropriately tuned,\nthe non-overlapping methods can reduce the convergence gap sufficiently to\nsignificantly outperform the overlapping methods."}
