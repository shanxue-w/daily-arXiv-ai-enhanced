The amount of\nshock-capturing artificial viscosity is determined by a smoothness sensor that\nmeasures deviations from a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO)\nreconstruction. Since this kind of dissipative stabilization does not guarantee\nthat the nodal states of the finite element approximation stay in a convex\nadmissible set, we adaptively constrain deviations of these states from\nintermediate cell averages. The representation of our scheme in terms of such\ncell averages makes it possible to apply convex limiting techniques originally\ndesigned for positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.\nAdapting these techniques to the continuous Galerkin setting and using\nBernstein polynomials as local basis functions, we prove the invariant domain\npreservation property under a time step restriction that can be significantly\nweakened by using a flux limiter for the auxiliary cell averages. The close\nrelationship to DG-WENO schemes is exploited and discussed. All algorithmic\nsteps can be implemented in a matrix-free and hardware-aware manner.

Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field\ndownlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple\nRA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of\nseveral legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to\nmaximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power\nallocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful\ninsights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze\na special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field\ninterference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using\nthe Fresnel integrals.

We show that null lines geometrically preserve\na larger set of conformal isometries than their timelike and spacelike\ncounterparts, explain a connection to non-relativistic systems, and constrain\ncorrelation functions using conformal Ward identities. We argue that having\nconformal symmetry, and especially maximal conformal symmetry, is extremely\nconstraining -- nearly trivializing systems. We consider the (3+1)d scalar\npinning field and null Wilson line examples in depth, compare their results to\nultraboosted limits of timelike and spacelike systems, and argue that\nshockwave-type solutions are generic. A number of physical consistency\nconditions compel us to consider defect correlators as distributions on a\nrestricted subspace of Schwartz test functions. Consequently, we provide a\nresolution to the longstanding problem of ultraboosted limits of gauge\npotentials in classical electromagnetism. We briefly analyze semi-infinite\nsources for the scalar in ($4-\\epsilon$)-dimensions, consider solutions on the\nLorentzian cylinder, and introduce the ''perfect null polygon'' which emerges\nfor compatibility between Gauss' law and ultraboosted limits."}

Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety\nmechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety\nmonitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that\nutilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide\nconfidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML\nincorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic\nnature of QML outputs.

While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,\nexisting methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental\ndifferences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety\nmechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety\nmonitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that\nutilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide\nconfidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML\nincorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic\nnature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification\nevaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is\ndataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the\nunique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance\nmetrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between\noperational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of\nQML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human\noversight, enhancing system transparency and safety."}

Although extensive\nresearch exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper\npositions remains challenging due to its discrete nature.

The absence of\nconserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The\nrecently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground\nstate is analytically known.

In this work, through rigorous analytical\ncalculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic\nand open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming\nits nonintegrable nature.

The method that we have\nused is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and\ndifferential geometry of second order differential equations are explained.\nThen an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the\nLorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on\nthe space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the\naveraged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams\ndescribed by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are\nsimilar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by\nthe simpler {\\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of\nthese models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on\nthe Vlasov equation and {\\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The\naveraged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This\nfact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged\ncharged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\\it diameter of the\ndistribution function}, by powers of the {\\it energy of the beam} and by the\ntime of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov\nequation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same.\nFinally, as an application of the {\\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we\nre-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the\nJacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation."}

By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation\nformulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined\nPDEs $P^{\\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\\'e- or\nKorn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence,\nlinearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators\n(which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part\nof the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are\noverdetermined).\n  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery\non curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on\nprescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by\nduality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth\naverages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the\nprevious constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore\nidentify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the\nprincipal symbol $p(x, \\xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex\nvectors $\\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal\nsymbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the\ncondition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is\nfinite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel\ncondition (FC).

Two novel families of geometric\nfunctionals are introduced based on the support measures of the set itself as\nwell as of its parallel sets, respectively. The associated scaling exponents\nprovide new tools for extracting geometric information of the set, beyond its\nclassical fractal dimensions while also encoding its outer Minkowski dimension.\nFurthermore the scaling exponents also directly connect to the complex\ndimensions of the set while preserving essential geometric information. The\nframework provides a fundamental link between measure-theoretic approaches and\nanalytical methods in fractal geometry, offering new perspectives on both the\ngeometric measure theory of singular sets and the complex analytic theory of\nfractal zeta functions."}

It is well established that\ndifferent indices have different strengths and perform unequally across\napplication scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability\nof an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies\nsignificantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the\nongoing search for new and possibly \\enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An\neasy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a\nlinear combination of established indices.\n  Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context\nare the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these\nclassic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into\nmore elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties\nof a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus\nSackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by\nall Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless\nforms a balance index.\n  Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless\nindices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is\nanother index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary\nbuilding blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices\nbut also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing\nthe balance of different trees."}
