In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's\nbackscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low\nmodulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To\nimprove the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with\nHAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption\nand transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and\nAC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs\nunder the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC\nordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients,\nthe transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU\nduring BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's\ntransmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints\ninvolved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC\nordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further\nconsiders the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our\nproposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively.

The key idea is to employ\ntrue-time-delay (TTD) units together with phase shifters (PS) to synthesize a\ncontrollable joint angle-distance (JAD) trajectory that establishes a unique\nmapping between subcarriers and spatial locations, enabling single scan\nacquisition of target angle and range.

Instead of assuming\nidealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a\nvariational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical\nformalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical\naverages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the\nparameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies\nhow fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the\nresults of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information\ncriteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive\nlearning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact\nreplica calculations are not feasible."}

However, existing\napproaches face significant challenges when dealing with multimodal or mixtures\nof distributions. The inherent complexity of such structures often precludes an\nexplicit functional relationship between the contextual information and the\nuncertain parameters, limiting the direct applicability of parametric models.\nConversely, while non-parametric models offer greater representational\nflexibility, they are plagued by the \"curse of dimensionality,\" leading to\nunsatisfactory performance in high-dimensional problems.

One of the main results we obtain in this process is a dual\nMaschke-type theorem relating coseparability and total integrals.

Our first main theorem proves a\nuniversal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any\nsmooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and\nconcurrence of the one-qubit reduction.

For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB\nis derived in closed form.

For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of\nmaximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the\nhorizontal and vertical axes.

In this\npaper, we study the channel modeling and joint optimization of antenna\npositioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS.

Compared to\nthe state-of-the-art Sionna model, our approach achieves an $83.3\\%$ reduction\nin computation time with an approximately $3$ dB increase in root-mean-square\nerror (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our channel model enables a\nclosed-form solution for the optimal antenna position, achieving near-optimal\nperformance. {For the joint optimization problem, the proposed GRPO algorithm\noutperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate,\nwhile requiring only 49.2\\% computational resources of PPO, due to its\ngroup-based advantage estimation.} Simulation results reveal that increasing\neither the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant\nimprovements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected\nconservatively without sacrificing performance."}

For upper bounds, our method systematically\nsearches for state and channel extensions that minimize known\ninformation-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of\nall possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that\novercomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved\nupper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined\ncontinuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new\nstate-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing\nchannel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the\npreviously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian\noptimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish\nlower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum\ninstruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by\nparameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical\nresults for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our\nmethods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results.\nTogether, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and\npowerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication\nlimits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel\ncoherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity\nlower bounds in general."}

This work introduces and systematically studies a new\nconvex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual\nto the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a\ncomplete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant\nmaps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP,\nthereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of\ncopositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous\nframework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary\napplication of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps\n$\\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive\nexact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or\ndecomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic\nparameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive\nindecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from\ninfinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as\nPaley graphs.\n  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes\nof symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares\n(SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of\ncopositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for\ndifferent levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this\nduality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke\nstates that are simultaneously entangled and $\\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic\nextendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \\geq 2$ and local dimension $n\n\\geq 5$."}
