We develop a finite element method\nfor solving the Richards equation by introducing a new bounded auxiliary\nvariable to eliminate unbounded terms in the weak formulation of the method.\nThis formulation is discretized using a semi-implicit scheme and the resulting\nnonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Our approach eliminates the\nneed of regularization techniques and offers advantages in handling both dry\nand fully saturated zones. In the proposed techniques, a non-overlapping\nSchwarz domain decomposition method is used for modeling infiltration in\nlayered soils. We apply the proposed method to solve the Richards equation\nusing the Havercamp and van Genuchten models for the capillary pressure.\nNumerical experiments are performed to validate the proposed approach,\nincluding tests such as modeling flows in fibrous sheets where the initial\nmedium is totally dry, two cases with fully saturated and dry regions, and an\ninfiltration problem in layered soils. The numerical results demonstrate the\nstability and accuracy of the proposed numerical method. The numerical\nsolutions remain positive in the presence of totally dry zones. The numerical\ninvestigations clearly demonstrated the capability of the proposed method to\neffectively predict the dynamics of flows in unsaturated soils."}

The scheme\nadopts a Robin-Robin coupling condition, evaluating the right-hand side of the\nRobin boundary terms at each time step solely from the previous-step solutions.\nThis explicit scheme allows the fluid and structure subproblems to be solved\nentirely independently within each time step, eliminating the need for\nstaggered coupling or costly sub-iterations, which makes the method highly\nefficient and scalable for parallel computation. %More importantly, the\nproposed explicit scheme is inherently free from the added-mass effect\nguarantees unconditional stability.

The classical notion of sufficiency and completeness\nare not adequate in many robust estimations that are based on different\ndivergences. Recently, the notion of generalized sufficiency based on a\ngeneralized likelihood function was introduced in the literature. It is\nimportant to note that the concept of sufficiency alone does not necessarily\nproduce optimal statistics (estimators). Thus, in line with the generalized\nsufficiency, we introduce a generalized notion of completeness with respect to\na generalized likelihood function. We then characterize the family of\nprobability distributions that possesses completeness with respect to the\ngeneralized likelihood function associated with the density power divergence\n(DPD). Moreover, we show that the family of distributions associated with the\nlogarithmic density power divergence (LDPD) is not complete. Further, we extend\nthe Lehmann-Scheff\\'e theorem and the Basu's theorem for the generalized\nlikelihood estimation. Subsequently, we obtain the generalized uniformly\nminimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) for the\n$\\mathcal{B^{(\\alpha)}}$-family.

It is demonstrated that the optimal\nLagrange multipliers governing this approximated problem can be found by\nsolving a linear program. The constraints of this linear program are derived\nfrom Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and are expressed in terms of the\ngeneralized eigenvalues of channel-derived matrices. This framework facilitates\nthe derivation of an analytical formula for an approximate local secrecy\ncapacity. Furthermore, we define and analyze a new class of secret local\ncontraction coefficients. These coefficients, characterized as the largest\ngeneralized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil, quantify the maximum achievable\nratio of approximate utility to approximate leakage, thus measuring the\nintrinsic local leakage efficiency of the channel. We establish bounds\nconnecting these local coefficients to their global counterparts defined over\ntrue mutual information measures. The efficacy of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated through detailed analysis and numerical illustrations for both\ngeneral multi-mode channels and the canonical binary symmetric wiretap channel."}

It\nensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and\nprovides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a\ncrucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,\nVPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms\nrather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid\ngeneration approach, referred to as \\emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which\nconstructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.\nThese VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations\nessential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more\naccurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed\napproach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain\nscans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for\n35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of\nthe computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the\ncomputed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse\nmap.

This space can be\nviewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$\nmatrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic\" counterpart $S_n(X)$,\nconstructed as a convolution $X^n \\times^{S_n} \\mathrm{GL}_n/\\mathrm{T}_n$. Our\nmain result establishes that a natural map $\\sigma \\colon S_n(X) \\to C_n(X)$\ninduces an isomorphism on $\\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$\nor the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the\nclassical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion\ncorrespondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the\nBetti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we\nprove a Hermitian variant of our main result."}

To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision\nProcesses (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but\nwhere transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent\nadvances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this\nlatent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to\ndetermine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now\naddressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages\nclustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed\neffectively speed up learning.\n  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first\nlearns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an\noptimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm\nachieves a regret that is $O(\\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible\nto clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the\ncardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\\cdot)$ holds\nup to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior\nbound, $O(\\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that\nno algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.\nThis establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic\noptimality."}
