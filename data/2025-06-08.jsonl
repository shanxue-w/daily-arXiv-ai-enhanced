In particular, neural network discretizations of\nsolutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to\ntheir nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of\nthe continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete\neigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more\nspecialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the\neigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called\nthe \"Rayleigh quotient\" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization\nprocedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues\nand their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for\nfinding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and\nnonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss\nthe utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating\nsolutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from\nengineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,\nGram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the\neigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous\neigenvalue problems."}

Our new $q$-$\\hbar$ Heisenberg algebra $\\mathcal{H}_q$\nis generated by elements $\\hat{x}_\\alpha$, $\\hat{y}_\\lambda$, and\n$\\hat{p}_\\beta$ with $\\alpha, \\lambda, \\beta \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and is defined\nthrough generalized commutation relations parameterized by real constants $n,\nm, l$ and three dynamical functions $\\Psi(q)$, $\\Phi(q)$, and $\\Pi(q)$\ndepending on the deformation parameter $q$ and the generators. By selecting\nappropriate values for these parameters and functions, our framework recovers\nseveral well-known algebras as special cases, including the classical\nHeisenberg algebra for $q = 1$ and $\\Psi = 1$, $\\Phi = \\Pi = 0$, and various\n$q$-deformed algebras for $q \\neq 1$. The algebraic consistency of these\ngeneralizations is demonstrated through a series of explicit examples, and the\nresulting structures are shown to align with quantum planes\n\\cite{Yuri-Manin2010} and enveloping algebras associated with Lie algebra\nhomomorphisms \\cite{Reyes2014a}. This construction offers a flexible and\nunified formalism for studying quantum deformations, with potential\napplications in quantum mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and quantum group\ntheory."}

A key factor in achieving\nhigh error correction performance is the use of soft-decision decoding for\ncomponent codes. However, implementing optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nprobability decoding for commonly used component codes, such as BCH and Polar\ncodes, is computationally prohibitive. Instead, practical systems rely on\napproximations, with the Chase-Pyndiah algorithm being a widely used suboptimal\nmethod. TPC are more powerful than their component codes and begin to function\neffectively at low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, during the initial\niterations, the component codes do not perform well and introduce errors in the\nextrinsic information updates. This phenomenon limits the performance of TPC.\nThis paper proposes a neural network-aided rollback Chase-Pyndiah decoding\nmethod to address this issue. A transformer-based neural network identifies\ncases where extrinsic updates are likely to introduce errors, triggering a\nrollback mechanism which prevents the update and keeps the component code\nmessage intact. Our results demonstrate that a neural network with a relatively\nsmall number of parameters can effectively distinguish destructive updates and\nimprove decoding performance. We evaluate the proposed approach using TPC with\n(256, 239) extended BCH component codes. We show that the proposed method\nenhances the bit error rate performance of Chase-Pyndiah p=6 decoding,\nachieving a gain of approximately 0.145 dB in a TPC scheme with four full\niterations, significantly outperforming conventional Chase p=7 decoding."}

In this context, pressure-velocity coupling is a key\nissue, and countless numerical techniques and methods have been developed over\nthe decades to solve these equations efficiently and accurately. In two\ndimensions, an alternative approach is to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations\nregarding two scalar quantities: the streamfunction and the vorticity. Compared\nto the primitive variables approach, this formulation does not require pressure\nto be computed, thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties associated with the\npressure-velocity coupling. However, deriving boundary conditions for the\nstreamfunction and vorticity is challenging. This work proposes an efficient,\nhigh-order accurate finite-volume discretisation of the two-dimensional\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the streamfunction-vorticity\nformulation. A detailed discussion is devoted to deriving the appropriate\nboundary conditions and their numerical treatment, including on arbitrary\ncurved boundaries.

This paper develops the proposed\nSpherical-Dirichlet Distribution designed to fit vectors located at the\npositive orthant of the hypersphere, as it is often the case for data in these\nfields, avoiding unnecessary probability mass. Basic properties of the proposed\ndistribution, including normalizing constants and moments are developed.\nRelationships with other distributions are also explored. Estimators based on\nclassical inferential statistics, such as method of moments and maximum\nlikelihood estimators are obtained. Two applications are developed: the first\none uses simulated data, and the second uses a real text mining example. Both\nexamples are fitted using the proposed Spherical-Dirichlet Distribution and\ntheir results are discussed."}

However, standard methods for\ndetermining the number of factors often overestimate the true number when data\nexhibit heavy-tailed randomness, misinterpreting noise-induced outliers as\ngenuine factors. This paper addresses this challenge within the framework of\nElliptical Factor Models (EFM), which accommodate both heavy tails and\npotential non-linear dependencies common in real-world data. We demonstrate\ntheoretically and empirically that heavy-tailed noise generates spurious\neigenvalues that mimic true factor signals. To distinguish these, we propose a\nnovel methodology based on a fluctuation magnification algorithm. We show that\nunder magnifying perturbations, the eigenvalues associated with real factors\nexhibit significantly less fluctuation (stabilizing asymptotically) compared to\nspurious eigenvalues arising from heavy-tailed effects. This differential\nbehavior allows the identification and detection of the true and spurious\nfactors. We develop a formal testing procedure based on this principle and\napply it to the problem of accurately selecting the number of common factors in\nheavy-tailed EFMs. Simulation studies and real data analysis confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods, particularly in\nscenarios with pronounced heavy-tailedness."}

Preliminary version submitted for documentation\n  purposes on arXiv. This version records results presented at a conference and\n  is not peer-reviewed", "summary": "Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to\nassist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible\nexoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a\nsafer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal\nrobot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton\nevaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation\n(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait\nreplication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum\nmodel, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human\nmotion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized\ncontrol method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively\nreplicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping\ntrapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear\nvelocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This\nmodification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring\ncompatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes\nthe control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and\ntorques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in\naccordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load\nassociated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility\nof the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The\nbipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for\nknee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under\ncontrolled conditions."}

Specifically, we find the\nLyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each\nmethod -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp\nperformance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison\nbetween $\\mathrm{EF}$, $\\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our\nanalysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which\nallows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying\nmechanisms."}

In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic costs\nassociated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we\nanalyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary\ninput-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the\nground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced\ndynamics~\\textemdash~that is, the minimal thermodynamic work required to erase\nthe logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to\nthe ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input\nstate. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional\nto the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the\ndynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. A key foundation of this\nresult is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates\nthe decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges\nthermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum\ncomputation."}

Recent studies of\nanyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases\nback in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the\nstring-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge\ntheory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We\nreinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus\nextending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By\nexplicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we\nconstruct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge\ntransformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional\nlattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological\nphase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena,\nsuch as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping\ngauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective\ntheory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare\nanyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak\ntheory and the Cooper pair condensation."}

These 2D models are realised by giving critical\nboundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by\nstring-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these\ncritical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of\nnon-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the\ncritical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation\ntree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice\nmodels, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown\ncritical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points\n(c$\\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup\nsymmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The\ncondensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality,\npredicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely\nthe global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This\nis not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model\nrelated to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision\nnumerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving\ntensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show\nthat critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data\n(Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus\nestablishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially\nclassifying new conformal field theories."}
