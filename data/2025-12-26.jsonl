The present work demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic to the structure of the finite element spaces themselves. In particular, it is shown to be closely connected to the standard $L^2$-projection of derivatives, which possesses a super-approximation property exclusively for odd polynomial degrees. We also examine the implications of this feature for an energy-conservative Galerkin approximation of the regularized long-wave equation where the energy is a cubic functional. Although the resulting scheme conserves both mass and energy, we further show that the impulse is approximated with high accuracy, and we establish {\\em a priori} error bounds for the associated semi-discrete formulation."}

By relying only on scalar and finite-dimensional quantities, our formulation ensures that the resulting methods give exactly tangential and incompressible velocity fields, while also being pressure robust. Compared to traditional methods based on velocity-pressure formulations, where one can only guarantee these structural properties by increasing the computational costs, this is a key advantage. We rigorously validate our formulation by proving its equivalence to the well understood velocity-pressure formulation under reasonable regularity assumptions.

Guided by a sociocognitive framework, we employ complementary measures -- performance gaps, homework-exam correlations, and Wasserstein distance -- to characterize divergence between practice and mastery. Results reveal a growing integrity gap as course content shifts from procedural to conceptual and spatially intensive mathematics.

When pure Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the displacement, the leading block of the resulting algebraic system becomes almost singular in the nearly incompressible (locking) regime, hindering efficient iterative solution. To overcome this, the system is reformulated as a three-field problem with an inherent regularization that maintains the original solution while ensuring nonsingularity. Analysis shows that both the minimal residual (MINRES) and generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods, when preconditioned with inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners, achieve convergence independent of mesh size and the locking parameter for the regularized system. Similar theoretical results are established for the situation with displacement subject to mixed boundary conditions, even without regularization.

However, we focus on the Hamiltonian formulation here mostly. We derive and study convergence of the associated abstract but scalar Hamilton-Jacobi equations, defined in space of probability measures. There is an infinite dimensional singular averaging structure within these equations. We develop an indirect variational approach to apply finite dimensional weak K.A.M. theory to such infinite dimensional setting here. With a weakly interacting particle assumption, the averaging step only involves that of individual particles, which is implicitly but rigorously treated using the weak K.A.M. theory. Consequently, we can close the above mentioned averaging step by identifying limiting Hamiltonian, and arrive at a rigorous convergence result on solutions of the nonlinear PDEs in space of probability measures.\n  In technical development parts of the paper, we devise new viscosity solution techniques regarding projection of equations with a submetry structure in state space, multi-scale convergence for certain abstract Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces, as well as comparison principles for equations in space of probability measures. The space of probability measure we consider is a special case of Alexandrov metric space with curvature bounded from below.

However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE."}

By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity.

GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $α$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $α$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach. Using low precision (Bfloat16 or FP32) to solve the subsystems, we obtain speedups of $2.6\\times$, $1.7\\times$, and $3.1\\times$ over a full double precision GADI implementation on large-scale 2D, 3D convection-diffusion and complex reaction-diffusion problems (up to $1.3\\times 10^{8}$ unknowns), respectively."}

This theoretical insight, combined with the technique of the matrix direct sum, makes it possible to develop a novel model-free sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming algorithm that directly estimates optimal control gain without requiring an initial stabilizing controller, or noises measurability. The robustness of the model-free SDP method to errors is investigated.

However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution."}

We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings.

Such numerical fluxes have been recently introduced by Toro, Saggiorato, Tokareva, and Hidalgo (Journal of Computational Physics, 416, 2020), and constitute a family of centred fluxes obtained from a suitable modification of First--Order Centred (FORCE) numerical fluxes. In contrast with upwind fluxes, such as Rusanov, Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) or the exact Riemann solver (RS) numerical flux, centred ones do not consider in any way the structure of the Riemann problem at cell interfaces. Adopting centred numerical fluxes leads to a high level of flexibility of the resulting numerical schemes, for example in the context of complicated hyperbolic systems, for which RSs may be impossible to construct or computationally expensive.\n  The baseline framework adopted in this investigation is a FV semidiscrete approach with Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization, and results are reported up to order 7. Previous investigations involving the same framework have established that increasing the order of accuracy tends to decrease the differences in the results obtained through different numerical fluxes. The goal of this paper is to show that the employment of FORCE--$α$ numerical fluxes within such a framework is a competitive alternative to the adoption of more classical upwind fluxes.

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator."}

Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions.

Following this direction, we prove a global Caderón-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence.

First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line.\n  The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry."}

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."}

We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity.

In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms.

Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices."}

This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings."}

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."}

Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling.

To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation."}

Since risk attitudes at the end of the investment horizon are uncertain, terminal wealth is evaluated under a set of utility functions corresponding to all possible future preference states. These utilities are first converted into certainty equivalents at their respective levels of terminal risk aversion and then (nonlinearly) aggregated over the conditional distribution of future states, yielding an inherently time-inconsistent optimization criterion. We approach this problem by developing a general equilibrium framework for such state-dependent preferences and characterizing subgame-perfect equilibrium investment policies through an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. This system gives rise to a coupled nonlinear partial integro-differential equation for the value functions associated with each state. We then specialize the model to a tractable constant relative risk aversion specification in which the preference factor follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. In this setting, the equilibrium policy admits a semi-explicit representation that decomposes into a standard myopic demand and a novel preference-hedging component that captures incentives to hedge against anticipated changes in risk aversion. Numerical experiments illustrate how features of the preference dynamics -- most notably the drift of the preference process and the correlation between preference shocks and asset returns -- jointly determine the sign and magnitude of the hedging demand and the evolution of the equilibrium risky investment over time."}

The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics."}

The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991."}

We analyze the consequences for the three energy contents produced by metric restrictions imposed on the admissible deformations.

Specifically, the optimal path measure is shown to admit an explicit density relative to a reference diffusion, generalizing the classical Schrödinger system.

We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array.
