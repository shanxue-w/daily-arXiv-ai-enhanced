The whole picture is even more\ncomplicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive\nmedia, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group)\nvelocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be\nconducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in\nspace. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial\nboundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally\nfollows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM:\nM2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary\nconditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and\ntwo space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at\nleast for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves\nregardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several\napproaches to handle the fact that q > N , we elect the so-called ''scalar''\napproach (which despite its name, also works when N > 1) as method of choice\nfor more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the\ncoefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion\nrelation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in\nthe spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide\ntruncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of\npast time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing\ncoefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using\nfloating-point arithmetic or not.

The primary components\nof our methodology are the following: (1) the adaptive construction of rational\npolynomial activation functions, (2) a novel backpropagation-free method for\ndetermining the weights and biases of the hidden layer, and (3) the computation\nof the weights and biases of the output layer through least-squares fitting.\nBreaking with the idea of \"safe\" rational activation functions, we introduce a\nrational activation function as a meromorphic function with a single pole\nsituated within the domain of investigation. Employing the weights and biases\nof the hidden layer, we then scale and shift the pole of the activation\nfunction to find the estimated locations of the singularities; this implies\nthat the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined by the number of\nsingularities of the function that is being approximated. While the weights and\nbiases of the hidden layer are tuned so as to capture the singularities, the\nleast-squares fitting for the computation of weights and biases of the output\nlayer ensures approximation of the function in the rest of the domain.

Our\nmain results not only improve the corresponding result of Balogh-Buckley\n[Invent.

We also provide a negative\nanswer to an open problem of Balogh-Buckley by constructing an Euclidean domain\nwith ball separation property but fails to satisfy the Gehring-Hayman\ninequality. Furthermore, we prove that ball separation condition, together with\nan LLC-2 condition, implies inner uniformality and thus the Gehring-Hayman\ninequality.\n  As a consequence of our new approach, we are able to prove such a geometric\ncharacterization of Gromov hyperbolicity in the fairly general setting of\nmetric spaces (without measures), which substantially improves the main result\nof Koskela-Lammi-Manojlovi\\'c [Ann.

To capture the stochastic nature of satellite failures and launch\nvehicle lead times, we adopt Markov chains to model both failure and\nreplenishment processes. We reinvestigate an indirect spare strategy, modeled\nas a multi-echelon periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, in\nwhich spares are first delivered to parking orbits and then transferred to\nconstellation planes. The stock levels in constellation and parking orbits are\neach modeled as independent Markov chains, and a fixed-point iteration yields a\nconsistent joint stationary solution that describes the strategy's average\nbehavior. This approach accurately captures the stochastic interplay within a\nmulti-echelon model driven by orbital mechanics, avoiding the aggregation\nassumptions of prior works and remaining valid across a wider operating domain.\nBuilding on this fast, accurate analysis, we formulate an optimization problem\nand solve it via a genetic algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical\nvalue of both the analysis method and the optimization framework in a\nreal-world mega-constellation case study."}

Building on the interpretation of the 3D\nindex as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative\nversion of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This\nnotion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove\nby developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an\ninductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use\nof Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new\nidentities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study\nthe limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to\nperform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a\nspecified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological\ninvariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed\nmanifolds."}
