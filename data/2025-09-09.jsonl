Our main result provides sharp\nbounds for heights outside a divisor of sufficiently positive type, while\nTheorem 4.10 yields an effective description of the exceptional locus where\nsuch inequalities may fail. As a first application, we deduce the finiteness of\n$S$-integral points on log-general type varieties, thereby obtaining a\nhigher-dimensional analogue of Siegel's theorem and new evidence toward Vojta's\nconjectures. Beyond these arithmetic applications, our methods bring together\ntools from Arakelov geometry, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of\ndeterminants of auxiliary sections. This synthesis yields new insights into the\ndistribution of rational and integral points on algebraic varieties, with\nconcrete consequences for curves of genus $\\geq 2$, abelian varieties, and\nanomalous intersections. We further indicate how our framework naturally leads\nto Vojta-type inequalities in higher dimension, to equidistribution results for\nsmall points, and to possible extensions toward Shimura varieties and\ntranscendental number theory. Taken as a whole, the results of this paper\ndemonstrate that positivity in Arakelov geometry provides the governing\nprinciple behind higher-dimensional Diophantine approximation, thereby opening\nthe path toward a unified approach to Lang-Vojta conjectures in arithmetic\ngeometry."}

This model can be viewed as a generalization of\nreal-driven Loewner evolutions in the upper half-plane, or as the deterministic\nanalogue of complex-driven Schramm-Loewner evolutions. First, we contribute to\nthe already known theory of such evolutions. We establish a sufficient\ncondition for drivers in the $C^1$-class to create a two-sided simple curve. By\nconstructing a counterexample in the $C^0$-class, we demonstrate that the same\ncondition is not necessary and discuss an alternative necessary and sufficient\ncondition for $C^0$-drivers that create two-sided curves.\n  Second, we analyze the evolutions driven by the one-parameter family of\ncomplex linear drivers $\\{ct\\}_{c \\in \\mathbb C}$. We show that the geometries\nof the generated hulls differ significantly from the chordal real-driven case.\nAlthough each complex linear driver creates a two-sided curve, the geometry of\nthe generated curve exhibits three distinct geometric phases depending on the\ncomplex parameter $c$: a simple phase, a simple with one end spiraling phase,\nand a third new exotic variant. In this exotic phase, one part of the curve is\nsimple while the other part forms a Jordan curve rooted at the origin. After\nforming the Jordan curve, this part ceases to grow while disconnecting an open\nset of positive area from infinity for arbitrarily large times.

For large random graphs arising\nfrom degree-corrected stochastic blockmodels with weakly distinguishable\ncommunity structure (and consequently, non-diverging eigenvalues), NetFlipPA\nprovably recovers the spectral noise floor (i.e., the upper-edge of the\neigenvalues corresponding to the noise component of the normalized adjacency\nmatrix).

In recent\nyears, various CG methods have been extended to Riemannian manifold\noptimization, but existing Riemannian CG methods are confined to smooth\nobjective functions and cannot handle nonsmooth ones. This paper proposes a\nRiemannian conjugate subgradient method for a class of nonconvex, nonsmooth\noptimization problems on manifolds. Specifically, we first select a Riemannian\nsubgradient from the convex hull of two directionally active subgradients. The\nsearch direction is then defined as a convex combination of the negative of\nthis subgradient and the previous search direction transported to the current\ntangent space. Additionally, a Riemannian line search with an interval\nreduction procedure is integrated to generate an appropriate step size,\nensuring the objective function values form a monotonically nonincreasing\nsequence. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm under mild\nassumptions. Numerical experiments on three classes of Riemannian optimization\nproblems show that the proposed method takes significantly less computational\ntime than related existing methods. To our knowledge, this is the first CG-type\nmethod developed for Riemannian nonsmooth optimization."}

Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to\nadaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy\nconvergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in\nprobability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive\nexperiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a\npreviously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to\nconverge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence\ncreates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is\npractically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations\nof complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive\nexperiments to balance bias and variance.\n  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms\nthat are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on\nthis guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an\ninverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic\nnormality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that\nthe proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals,\nand can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of\noffline policy evaluation.

While decoding is a classical\npost-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum\nnoise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$)\nand phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce\nthe Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder,\nwhich systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error\ncorrection. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting:\ncorrelated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional\nprobabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative\nprocedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a\nhardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in\nfinite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results\nunder circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\\geq\n17$ and physical error rates $\\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates\nby over 20x with only a few iterations.

The first\nconcerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses\nrandom graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\ngraph $\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \\in \\mathcal{O}((\\log\n(k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the\nsecond. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network\nsetting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees\nremain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal\nnonparametric rate $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows."}

This setting is closely related with the\ntwo-matrix model and the Ising model on random maps, which have been\nintensively studied in theoretical physics, leading to several enumerative\nformulas for hypermaps that were still awaiting bijective proofs.\n  Generally speaking, the slice decomposition consists in cutting along\ngeodesics. A key feature of hypermaps is that the geodesics along which we cut\nare directed, following the canonical orientation of edges imposed by the\ncoloring. This orientation requires us to introduce an adapted notion of\nslices, which admit a recursive decomposition that we describe.\n  Using these slices as fundamental building blocks, we obtain new bijective\ndecompositions of several families of hypermaps: disks (pointed or not) with a\nmonochromatic boundary, cylinders with monochromatic boundaries (starting with\ntrumpets or cornets having one geodesic boundary), and disks with a \"Dobrushin\"\nboundary condition.
