The lightning method is a recent development in the\nnumerical solution of linear PDEs which expresses solutions using sums of\npolynomials and rational functions, or more generally as sums of fundamental\nsolutions. The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp\ncorners where solution singularities are present. Boundary conditions are\nformed on a set of collocation points which is then solved as an overdetermined\nlinear system. The approach of the present work is to utilize the Laplace\ntransform to obtain a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved by an\napplication of the lightning method. The numerical inversion of the Laplace\ntransform is then performed by means of Talbot integration. Our validation of\nthe method against existing results and multiple challenging test problems\nshows the method attains spectral accuracy with root-exponential convergence\nwhile being robust across a wide range of time intervals and adaptable to a\nvariety of geometric scenarios."}

In the rank one case (in\nparticular, for hyperbolic spaces), we show that the sufficient condition for\nthe \\textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality matches the necessary condition in the\nrange $p \\leq q \\leq p'$, yielding a sharp characterization of admissible\npolynomial weights with non-negative exponents.\n  In the Jacobi setting, we modify the transform so that the associated measure\nexhibits polynomial volume growth. This modification enables us to fully\ncharacterize the class of polynomial weights with non-negative exponents for\nwhich Pitt-type inequalities hold for the modified Jacobi transforms. As\napplications of the \\textit{shifted} Pitt's inequalities, we derive $L^2$-type\nHeisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty inequalities and further establish\ngeneralized $L^p$ versions. Moreover, the geometric structure of symmetric\nspaces allows us to formulate a broader version of the uncertainty inequalities\npreviously obtained by Ciatti-Cowling-Ricci in the setting of stratified Lie\ngroups."}

This extends categorical\ncondensation beyond fusion n-categories to all enriched monoidal\n$\\infty$-categories with certain colimits. The resulting theory is capable of\ntreating symmetries of arbitrary dimension and codimension that are enriched,\ncontinuous, derived, non-semisimple and non-separable. Additionally, we\nconsider a truncated variant of the notion of condensation introduced by\nGaiotto and Johnson-Freyd, and show that iterative condensation of monoidal\nmonads and $E_i$-algebras provide examples.

In particular, probabilistic forecasting, which\nmodels demand as a stochastic process, is capable of capturing uncertainty. An\nexample of such modeling is the use of L\\'evy processes, which possess\nindependent increments and accommodate discontinuous changes (jumps). However,\nto the best of our knowledge, in inventory control using L\\'evy processes, no\nstudies have investigated how the order quantity and reorder point affect the\ntotal cost. One major difficulty has been the mathematical formulation of\ninventory replenishment triggered at reorder points. To address this challenge,\nthe present study formulates a reorder-point policy by modeling cumulative\ndemand as a drifted Poisson process and introducing a stopping time to\nrepresent the timing at which the reorder point is reached. Furthermore, the\nvalidity of the proposed method is verified by comparing the total cost with\nthat obtained from a case where an ARIMA model is combined with a reorder-point\npolicy. As a main result, while the total cost under ARIMA-based forecasting\nincreases linearly over time, the L\\'evy process-based formulation provides an\nanalytical expression for the total cost, revealing that random demand\nfluctuations cause the expected total cost to grow at a rate faster than\nlinear."}

Due to the tremendous size of data\nsets, the scale of bilevel hyperparameter optimization problem could be\nextremely large, posing great challenges in designing efficient numerical\nalgorithms. In this paper, we focus on solving the large-scale mathematical\nprograms with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) derived from hyperparameter\nselection of L1-support vector classification (L1-SVC). We propose a highly\nefficient single-loop smoothing damped Newton method (SDNM) for solving such\nMPEC. Compared with most existing algorithms where subproblems are involved and\nsolved by on-shelf packages, our approach fully takes advantage of the\nstructure of MPEC and therefore is single-loop. Moreover, the proposed SDNM\nenjoys a quadratic convergence rate under proper assumptions. Extensive\nnumerical results over LIBSVM dataset show the superior performance of SDNM\nover other state-of-art algorithms including the Scholtes global relaxation\nmethod (SGRM) with subproblem solved by SNOPT and the Matlab built-in function\nfmincon, especially in CPU time. For example, for dataset w4a, SDNM is 20 times\nfaster than SGRM and 3 times faster than fmincon. Further numerical results\nalso verifies the quadratic convergence rate of SDNM as well as the fulfillment\nof the second order sufficient condition, while guarantees that SDNM returns a\nstrict local minimizer of the smoothing problem of MPEC."}

This paper\nintroduces two families of linear channel codes to mitigate ISI: Zero Pad Zero\nStart (ZPZS) and Zero Pad (ZP) codes, ensuring that each codeword avoids\nconsecutive bit-1s. The ZPZS and ZP codes are then combined to form a binary ZP\ncode, offering a higher code rate than linear ZP codes and allowing simple\ndecoding via the Majority Location Rule (MLR). Additionally, a Leading One Zero\nPad (LOZP) code is proposed, which relaxes zero-padding constraints by\nprioritizing the placement of bit-1s, achieving a higher rate than ZP. A\nclosed-form expression is derived to compute expected ISI, showing it depends\non the average bit-1 density in the codewords. ISI and Bit Error Rate (BER)\nperformance are evaluated under two MCvD channel models: (i) without refresh,\nwhere past bits persist longer, and (ii) with refresh, where the channel is\ncleared after each reception. Results show that the LOZP code performs better\nin the refresh channel due to initial bit-1 placement, while ZP excels without\nrefresh by reducing average bit-1 density.

In this\nwork, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by\nintroducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework.

Given a maximum degree $p$, we define trial and test\nspaces $U$ and $V$ as 2D or 3D trunk spaces and form the integration space\n$\\mathcal{S} = U \\otimes V$. We then construct exact quadrature rules by\nsolving a non-convex optimisation problem over the number of points $q$, their\ncoordinates, and weights. We use a shallow neural network with linear\nactivations to parametrise the rule, and a random restart strategy to mitigate\nconvergence to poor local minima. When necessary, we dynamically increase $q$\nto achieve exact integration. Our construction reaches machine-precision\naccuracy (errors below 1e-22) using significantly fewer points than standard\ntensor-product Gaussian quadrature: up to 30\\% reduction in 2D for $p \\leq 10$,\nand 50\\% in 3D for $p \\leq 6$. These results show that combining the\nmathematical understanding of polynomial structure with numerical optimisation\ncan lead to a practical and extensible methodology for improving the\nadaptiveness, efficiency, and scalability of quadrature rules for high-order\nfinite element simulations."}

In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation\nthe carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a\nquasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and\nDoppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the\nchannel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a\nsingle Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can\nbe used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes\nchannel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency\nsince it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually\nunbiased. However, the naive approach to equalization has complexity ${\\mathcal\nO}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$ and $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler\nbins in an OTFS frame.

In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment\ntheir internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These\nfragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations --\nto be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and\nprojective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in\ntopological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark\nof non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in\ntopological quantum computation."}

Due to the lack of explicit\ntarget samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion\nsamplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning\nprocesses. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy\nand model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose\nAdjoint Schr\\\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that\nemploys simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to\nestimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical\nmodel -- the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via\nkinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal\ncontrol theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned\nat scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution.\nNotably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to\narbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition\nthat largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy\nfunctions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann\ndistributions."}
