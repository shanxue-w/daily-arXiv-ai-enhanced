Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms\nthat update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the\nSVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm\nthat decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the\nmemory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm\nbased on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales\nquadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling.

The proposed method, SE-QRSC, is particularly effective\nfor wide matrices with significantly more columns than rows. Starting from a\nmatrix $A$, the algorithm selects $k$ columns from the sketched matrix $B = A\n\\Omega^T$, where $\\Omega$ is a sparse subspace embedding of\n$\\mathrm{range}(A^T)$. The sparsity structure of $\\Omega$ is then exploited to\nmap the selected pivots back to the corresponding columns of $A$, which are\nthen used to produce the final subset of selected columns. We prove that this\nprocedure yields a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, thus\nrevealing the spectrum of $A$. The resulting bounds exhibit a reduced\ndependence on the number of columns of $A$ compared to those obtained from the\nstrong rank-revealing QR factorization of $A$.

We analyze the Mordell-Weil ranks,\n2-Selmer ranks, and 3-Selmer ranks of the corresponding elliptic curves $E_D:\ny^2 = x^3 - D^2x$, where $D$ is a square-free number. Our study empirically\nexamines the Heath-Brown heuristics, which predict the distribution of\n$2$-Selmer ranks as well as congruent numbers based on their residue modulo\n$8$. In particular, offering statistical insights into the proportion of\nnumbers whose associated elliptic curves have positive rank. We provide a\nrigorous verification of Goldfeld's Conjecture in this context, analyzing the\ndistribution of analytic ranks and demonstrating their alignment with the\nconjectured $50/50$ split for ranks $0$ and $1$. Furthermore, we explore the\nconjectural asymptotic distribution of $2-$ and $3$-torsion part of the\nTate-Shafarevich group of these curves. Based on empirical evidence, we also\nsuggest potential statistical distribution of $3$-Selmer and Mordell-Weil\nranks. We also examine the averages of Frobenius traces and observe that they\ntend to zero without exhibiting any murmuration-like patterns.\n  In addition to these number-theoretic analyses, we apply machine learning\ntechniques to classify and predict congruent numbers, exploring the efficacy of\ncomputational methods in distinguishing congruent from non-congruent numbers\nbased on the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves. This interdisciplinary\napproach blends advanced number theory with modern data science, providing\nempirical support for conjectures as well as discovery of new patterns."}

This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic\nSIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent\nhigh-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications.

Applied as a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill\n(CPMG) dynamical decoupling protocol to the dominant noise spectrum of\nsilicon-vacancy centers in diamond, it enhances ensemble coherence times by\nover $7\\times$ compared to interleaved bang-bang based CPMG. For\nstate-of-the-art dilution refrigerators, global resonant optimal decoupling\nacross $N_q$ spins sharply reduces heating, addressing the trade-off between\nthe spin coherence and scaling to $N_q \\gg 1$. We further introduce a modified\nsingle-photon entanglement protocol with an efficient algorithm for\ndeterministic entanglement compilation. Depending on the decoupling time\nwindow, our method yields order $O(10^2$-$10^4)$ more entanglement links than\nbang-bang sequences, with theoretical guarantees of order $\\Omega(N_q)$ unique\nlinks, improvable by control tuning. Together, these techniques provide\nscalable tools - including global control, phase denoising, remote\nentanglement, and compilation - for robust quantum computing architectures with\nheterogeneous spin ensembles."}

Each of the group is subdivided in three\nfamilies, acting to on the Hilbert space $L^2]-1,1[,$ $L^2(\\rr_+)$ resp.\n$L^2(\\rr)$. Motivated by geometric applications of these families, we call them\n{\\em spherical}, {\\em hyperbolic}, resp. {\\em deSitterian}. All these families\nare known from applications in Quantum Mechanics: e.g. spherical hypergeometric\nSchr\\\"odinger operators of the first kind are often called {\\em trigonometric\nP\\\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonians}.\n  For operators belonging to each family we compute their spectrum and\ndetermine their Green function (the integral kernel of their resolvent). We\nalso describe transmutation identities that relate these Green functions. These\nidentities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across\ndifferent operator families. Finally, we describe how these operators arise\nfrom separation of variables of (pseudo-)Laplacians on symmetric manifolds.\n  Our paper can be viewed as a sequel to \\cite{DL}, where closed realizations\nof one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators solvable in terms Kummer's confluent\nequation were studied."}

Specifically, the study examines an exploratory mean-variance (EMV)\nframework where investors aim to minimize risk while maximizing returns under\nincomplete market information, influenced by shifting economic regimes. The\nmarket model includes risk-free and risky assets, with liability dynamics\ndriven by a Markov regime-switching process. To align with real-world scenarios\nwhere financial decisions are made over discrete time periods, we adopt a\nmulti-period dynamic model. We present an optimal portfolio strategy derived\nusing RL techniques that adapt to these market conditions. The proposed\nsolution addresses the inherent time inconsistency in classical mean-variance\nmodels by integrating a pre-committed strategy formulation. Furthermore, we\nincorporate partial market observability, employing stochastic filtering\ntechniques to estimate unobservable market states. Numerical simulations and\nempirical tests on real financial data demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior returns, lower risk, and faster convergence compared to traditional\nmodels. These findings highlight the robustness and adaptability of our\nRL-based solution in dynamic and complex financial environments."}

This work is related to the black hole\ninterior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality\nconstant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy\nis less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note\nthat these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than\nthe Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand\nthe uncertainty relation."}

VQCs are trainable models\nthat run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to\naccomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first\ncontribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear\nleast-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it\nusing a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is\nto feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the\nresultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third\ncontribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF\nquantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.\nPreliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain\nenhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much\nfewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for\naddressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing."}

We characterize optimizers in terms of convexity of\nthe Lions lift. This is based on an observation which seems to be of\nindependent interest: the $c$-transform of a functional $\\phi$, where $c(\\mu,\n\\nu)$ denotes maximal covariance of $\\mu, \\nu$ corresponds precisely to the\nLegendre transform of the Lions lift of $\\phi$. Moreover we show that for\ntypical $P \\in\\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ the optimizer is unique and given by\na transport map. In the absence of a canonical reference measure on\n$\\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ we use a topological notion to make `typical'\nprecise. Specifically we show that the transport regular measures are of second\nBaire category.\n  A particular motivation for our article stems from the theory of adapted\ntransport where the adapted Wasserstein distance provides an adequate distance\nbetween stochastic processes. In contrast to other metrics, the adapted\nWasserstein distance yields continuity of Doob-decomposition, optimal stopping\nand stochastic control problems. Based on our results for measures on\n$\\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ we obtain a first Brenier-type theorem for the\nadapted Wasserstein distance."}

However, its accuracy is the result of a\nfortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and\nself-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of\nvertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is\ndisrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically\ngoes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a\nsingle correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the\nparticle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all\ntwo-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal\nstructure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function,\nthe self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations\nnecessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of\nthis approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its\naccuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems."}

Such structures guarantee spectral approximation results in\nterms of their finite sections. We extend this theory to unbounded, densely\ndefined closable operators, establishing a generalization of Halmos' classical\nresult: every closable quasidiagonal operator is a compact perturbation of a\nclosable block-diagonal operator on the same domain. Likewise, we introduce\nsparse F\\o lner sequences and establish an interplay between quasidiagonal\napproximations and the existence of sparse F\\o lner sequences.

These modes can grow collectively as\na discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single\nmode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory\nradial structures.

Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown;\napplications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two\ndistinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the\nexpectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon\nfield parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically\nin the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field\nexpansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term.\nHowever, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar\nmeasure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the\nsquare of the gauge coupling $\\beta=g^{-2}>0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir\noperator eigenvalue.
