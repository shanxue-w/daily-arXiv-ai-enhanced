Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors.\nThe nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the\northogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive\nor iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the\ndimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is\nimportant that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively.\nSecondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract\nvectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to\nemploy so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder\nQR.\n  For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used\nin MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular\northogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the\nvectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky\nQR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and\nhave proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key\nbenefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to\nvastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel\nor distributed architectures.

Recent advances in dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to\nidentify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this\nidea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to\nlearn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these\nmethods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable\noperations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value\ndecomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can\nintroduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems.

The\nproposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the\nSPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal\nreference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a\nreference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered\nvia traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD)).

An\ninstance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any\nredundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum\nnumber of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the\nnumber of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is\ncrucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and\nmathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity,\nuniversal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a\nnexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is\nto more deeply understand non-redundancy.\n  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \\ge 1$, there\nexists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is\n$\\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional\nnon-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We\ncompletely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates\n(i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy\nproblems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.\n  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP\n2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an\napplication of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev\nembeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing\nthat a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first\nexample of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the\nstructure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli\ngroup."}
