Moreover, traditional density control methods often rely on\nindependence assumptions that fail to capture swarm dynamics. We propose a\nnovel framework that addresses these limitations by employing flow matching as\nthe core modeling tool, where the flow model co-evolves with the control\npolicy. Unlike prior methods that treat transport trajectories as mere\ninterpolations between source and target distributions, our approach explicitly\noptimizes over the entire transport path, enabling the incorporation of\ntrajectory-dependent costs and collision avoidance constraints. Our framework\nbridges optimal transport theory with mean field control, providing a\nprincipled approach to multiagent coordination problems where both endpoint\nalignment and path properties are critical.

The\nquasi-Minnaert resonance manifests as two distinct wave patterns near the\nbubble's boundary: boundary localization and high-oscillation phenomena. We\ndemonstrate how to leverage the quasi-Minnaert resonance to induce stress\nconcentration in the elastic total wave field near the air bubble's boundary by\nappropriately selecting the incident elastic wave and high-contrast structure.\nThe interaction between the air bubble and the elastic background couples two\nphysical wave fields-acoustic and elastic waves-across the bubble's boundary.\nThe intricate transmission conditions, combined with the scalar nature of\nacoustic waves and the vectorial nature of elastic waves, present significant\nanalytical challenges. To address these, we employ layer potential theory and\nasymptotic analysis to rigorously establish the stress concentration and\nquasi-Minnaert resonance phenomena in a radially geometry bubble-elastic model.\nExtensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the stress\nconcentration phenomenon alongside quasi-Minnaert resonance for various bubble\ngeometries, including a unit disk, a corner domain, an apple-shaped domain in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$, and a ball in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

Ramana's dual has the following remarkable\nfeatures: i) it is an explicit, polynomial size semidefinite program ii) it\ndoes not assume that the primal is strictly feasible, nor does it make any\nother regularity assumptions iii) yet, it has strong duality with the primal.\nThe complexity implications of Ramana's dual are fundamental, and to date still\nthe best known. The most important of these is that SDP feasibility in the\nTuring model is not NP-complete, unless NP = co-NP.\n  We give a treatment of Ramana's dual which is both simpler and more complete,\nthan was previously available. First we connect it to a seemingly very\ndifferent way of inducing strong duality: reformulating the SDP into a rank\nrevealing form using elementary row operations and rotations. Second, while\nprevious works characterized its objective value, we completely characterize\nits feasible set: in particular, we show it is a higher dimensional\nrepresentation of an exact dual, which, however is not an explicit SDP. We also\nprove that -- somewhat surprisingly -- strict feasibility of Ramana's dual\nimplies that the only feasible solution of the primal is the zero matrix.\n  As a corollary, we obtain a short and transparent derivation of Ramana's\ndual, which we believe is accessible to both the optimization and the\ntheoretical computer science communities.

This paper\nstudies RQMC methods for functions with generalized exponential growth\nconditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main\ncontribution of this work is threefold. First, by combining RQMC and importance\nsampling (IS) techniques, we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands\nwith the critical growth condition $e^{A\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|^2}$ where $A = 1/2$.\nThis theory extends existing results in the literature, which are limited to\nthe case $A < 1/2$, and we demonstrate that by imposing a light-tail condition\non the proposal distribution in the IS, the RQMC method can maintain its\nhigh-efficiency convergence rate even in this critical growth scenario. Second,\nwe verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling\n(ODIS) satisfy the required light-tail condition, providing rigorous\ntheoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for\ndiscontinuous integrands from finance, we combine the preintegration technique\nwith RQMC-IS. We prove that this integrand after preintegration preserves the\nexponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated discontinuous\nfunctions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS convergence\nframework. Finally, numerical results validate our theory, showing that the\nproposed method is effective in handling these problems with discontinuous\npayoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates."}

The ensemble\nof uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an\nasymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm\nthis decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results\ndemonstrate that the \"expected polynomial time\" in order finding is only\nlocally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain\nexpands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical\nabsence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental\nlimit on the scalability of quantum factoring."}

Such polygons are described as subreducts\n(subalgebras of reducts) of the affine dyadic plane $D^2$, or equivalently as\ncommutative, entropic and idempotent groupoids under the binary operation of\narithmetic mean. The first part of the paper contained a new classification of\ndyadic triangles, considered as such groupoids, and a characterization of\ndyadic triangles with a pointed vertex. This second part investigates\nisomorphisms of dyadic triangles, and provides a full classification of their\nisomorphism types."}

As a consequence, we prove that for a\nlarge class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed\nHamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains\nwithin a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with\nphysical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain\ntechniques to the quantum setting.\n  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the\nDavies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the\nHamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded\nin terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient.\nThus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full\nDavies generator."}

The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism,\nwhich identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their\nfirst-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock\noccupations and $\\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl\ndecomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur\nlabels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the\ninverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\\text{poly}(L, N,\nd, \\log \\epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes\nto accuracy $\\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and\nGreen's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases.

Testing bosonic quantum states", "categories": ["quant-ph", "math-ph", "math.MP"], "comment": "47 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of\ncontinuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical\nsystems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a\nfundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we\nefficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the\nperspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory,\ncharacterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of\nthe number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of\ncopies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then\nextend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies\nsuffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are\nfar. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states\nnecessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a\nfundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on\nrotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently\nintroduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds."}
